Poverty in America is an administrative condition. The systems meant to help people require more capacity than the people they serve can provide. Markets that claim to serve preferences are producing them. Employment that used to build identity now empties it.

These articles turn the lens on the largest structures: bureaucracy, governance, the economy, and the lived experience of people inside those systems. The arc builds to a question that is simple to state and difficult to answer: if AI mediates work, choice, information, relationships, health, governance, and meaning, what is left that is specifically, irreducibly human?
