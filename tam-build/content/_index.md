title: "The Approximate Mind"
description: "Exploring how AI systems create approximations of human minds, and what this means for identity, dignity, knowledge, and power."

AI systems create approximations of human minds. Understanding what this means, for both humans and AI, is one of the defining questions of our time.

This is not a claim about technology. It is a claim about identity, dignity, knowledge, and power. The Approximate Mind explores it from every angle: philosophical, practical, emotional, political, institutional, developmental, familial.

Written by a father and son whose combined perspectives give the series its distinctive character. Syam Adusumilli brings 33 years in healthcare, technology, and architecture. Yagn Adusumilli brings the intellectual restlessness of a Purdue freshman studying Anthropology and AI. Together they produce something neither could alone: writing that is simultaneously grounded in institutional reality and unafraid to reimagine it.
