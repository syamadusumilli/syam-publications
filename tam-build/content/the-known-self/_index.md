Every AI you interact with is building a model of you. Not explicitly, not consciously, but functionally. The recommendation system that learned your preferences. The assistant that adapted to your communication style. The companion that remembers what you told it last month.

These articles explore what it means to be known by a machine. Memory scaffolding, personality modeling, the ethics of character, and the question that haunts the series: *Which you?*
