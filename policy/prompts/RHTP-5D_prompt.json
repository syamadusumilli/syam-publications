  "prompt": "A wide-angle shot of a rural county health department or community clinic interior, captured in soft morning light filtering through large windows, showing a community health worker or administrator reviewing performance metrics on papers spread across a wooden desk, with visible charts, maps marking rural service areas, and a calendar on the wall behind them—shot from a low angle or over-the-shoulder perspective that emphasizes the quiet work of data collection and local administration without showing faces clearly. The mood is documentary and intentional, with warm earth tones and worn wooden surfaces conveying the modest infrastructure and dedicated effort underlying rural health infrastructure.",
