  "prompt": "A weathered wooden desk in a small-town clinic waiting room, morning light streaming through a single window casting long shadows across scattered patient charts and a decades-old rolodex, with a practitioner's hand resting on an open appointment book—the composition emphasizing worn surfaces, accumulated years of practice, and the tactile evidence of independent stewardship rather than institutional systems.
