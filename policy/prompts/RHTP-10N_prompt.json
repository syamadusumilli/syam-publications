  "prompt": "A wide photograph taken from a rural county road at golden hour, showing agricultural fields stretching toward distant mountains under soft, hazy light. In the foreground, a weathered wooden fence post or irrigation equipment catches warm sidelight; the middle ground shows rows of crops or fallow land; the far background dissolves into the Coast Ranges in muted grays and browns. The composition emphasizes vast emptiness and distance rather than activity. Photographic style: documentary, grainy, shot in the cool-warm color palette of late afternoon in an inland valley, with no people visible but evidence of human agricultural presence—a distant farmhouse, a utility pole, a dirt road—creating a mood of isolation, scale, and quiet resilience. The light should feel authentic and slightly diffused, as though shot through dust or haze common to interior valleys.",
