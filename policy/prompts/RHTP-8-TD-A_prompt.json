  "prompt": "A wooden table in a modest community center or church hall, scattered with notebooks, handwritten lists, and assessment forms in afternoon light filtering through large windows. An overhead or angled composition capturing hands pointing to documents, coffee cups, and collaborative notes—suggesting careful evaluation and planning work. Muted earth-tone palette with natural wood grain visible.
