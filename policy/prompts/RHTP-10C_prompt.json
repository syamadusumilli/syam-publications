  "prompt": "A weathered wooden porch with peeling paint overlooking cotton fields at golden hour, shot from a low angle that emphasizes the worn texture of the railing and floorboards; hands of an older person resting on the porch rail in soft, directional light, with the vast agricultural landscape receding into haze behind them. Documentary-style photography with deep earth tones and subtle grain, conveying quiet resilience and the weight of place and time without sentimentality.",
