  "prompt": "A weathered wooden table in a rural Georgia kitchen, scattered with medical bills, insurance forms, and a worn clipboard, late afternoon sunlight casting long shadows through a window showing farmland beyond; hands of an unidentified person sorting through papers with quiet urgency, conveying the weight of healthcare decisions in a landscape of administrative complexity and financial strain. Photojournalistic documentary style with muted warm tones, shallow depth of field focusing on the paperwork while the rural vista remains softly visible, capturing the tension between distant policy numbers and intimate daily struggle.",
