  "prompt": "A wide-angle photograph taken during golden hour inside a rural school gymnasium, showing the wooden bleachers and polished floor bathed in warm, slanting light from high windows. In the mid-ground, a single basketball hoop casts a long shadow across the court. Include weathered architectural details—exposed beams, institutional-green walls, vintage scoreboard—that convey decades of community use. The composition should feel spacious and quiet, emphasizing the gymnasium as a gathering space rather than an active event, with perhaps a few distant figures or chairs arranged for a meeting. Shot in documentary style with natural grain and warm color grading to evoke both nostalgia and quiet resilience.",
