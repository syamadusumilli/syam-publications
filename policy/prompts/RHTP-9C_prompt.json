  "prompt": "A long county road stretching toward the horizon under soft morning light, flanked by sparse grassland and distant buttes, with a single pickup truck visible miles away; the composition emphasizes emptiness and scale, taken from ground level with warm amber and dusty ochre tones, conveying the vast distances and isolation that define frontier America.
