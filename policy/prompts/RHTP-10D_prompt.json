  "prompt": "A wide landscape photograph of flat Delta farmland under early morning mist, taken from a rural county road lined with weathered fence posts and bare or winter trees, the sky pale and overcast. In the soft middle distance, a small white wooden church or community building sits solitary against the flat horizon. The foreground shows worn asphalt and weeds at the road's edge—details suggesting decades of deferred maintenance. Muted greens, browns, and grays dominate; the light is diffuse and cool, lending quiet gravity to the emptiness. Shot in documentary photojournalism style, emphasizing the vast, austere geography and the isolation of essential institutions across the landscape.",
