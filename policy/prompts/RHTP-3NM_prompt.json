  "prompt": "A wide landscape shot of a New Mexico high desert highway stretching toward distant mountains under early morning light, golden and muted, with sparse vegetation and empty road ahead; in the foreground, an out-of-focus rural mailbox or road sign suggesting isolated communities; the composition emphasizes vast distance and emptiness, conveying both the scale of the geography and the isolation rural providers face, shot with a documentary photojournalism approach that captures the texture and weight of sparse settlement patterns.",
