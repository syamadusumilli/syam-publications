  "prompt": "# Image Prompt for Flux-Schnell\n\nA quiet county road stretching toward a distant horizon under soft golden-hour light, with a small rural clinic or health center visible in the middle distance, framed by expansive Minnesota farmland and tree lines. In the foreground, a worn wooden mailbox or a pair of hands holding medical paperwork on a kitchen table, suggesting the intimate scale of rural healthcare access. Muted greens, golds, and grays dominate; the light is warm but not bright, casting long shadows across the landscape. The composition should feel documentary and grounded—capturing the quiet resilience and vastness of rural Minnesota without sentimentality or staged elements.",
