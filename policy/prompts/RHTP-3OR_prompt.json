  "prompt": "A wide landscape shot of a rural Oregon valley at golden hour, with a small critical access hospital or clinic building visible in the middle distance—weathered but maintained, with a few vehicles in the parking lot. In the foreground, a county road stretches toward the horizon with fence posts and sparse trees, conveying vast distances between communities. Soft, warm light casts long shadows across fields; the mood is quiet and austere, suggesting both resilience and strain. Shot in documentary photojournalism style with muted earth tones and natural depth of field, capturing the geographic isolation and modest infrastructure that defines Oregon's rural healthcare landscape.",
