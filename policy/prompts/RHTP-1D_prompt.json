  "prompt": "A weathered farmhouse sits beyond a vast, harvested field under soft golden-hour light, with a single piece of modern agricultural equipment visible in the distance—conveying the scale and solitude of contemporary farming. The composition includes a rural mailbox or equipment shed in sharp detail in the foreground, with muted earth tones and long shadows stretching across dry grass, suggesting both the texture of agricultural labor and economic strain. Shot in documentary style with shallow depth of field, the image captures the paradox of rural productivity without prosperity—the material markers of work and land ownership rendered quiet and contemplative rather than celebratory.",
