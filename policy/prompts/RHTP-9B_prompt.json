  "prompt": "A wide landscape shot of a rural road cutting through high desert or forested terrain at golden hour, with a small community clinic or health center visible in the distance—modest, unpretentious architecture. In the foreground, hands rest on a wooden fence railing or vehicle door frame, belonging to an unseen figure gazing toward the horizon. Warm, dusty light filters across the land. The composition should feel contemplative and grounded, emphasizing the spatial distance and independence of tribal lands, with no people visible. Documentary photography aesthetic, capturing the quiet complexity of place and jurisdiction.",
