  "prompt": "A wide landscape shot of the High Plains at dawn, golden light stretching across flat horizon with a single center-pivot irrigation system silhouetted against the sky, its long arm casting shadows across dry, cracked earth and stubbled fields. In the foreground, weathered fence posts and sparse grass; distant farmstead barely visible. Overhead view or low angle to emphasize the vastness and fragility of the landscape. Muted ochre, tan, and gray tones with hints of rust-colored soil. Documentary photojournalism style, emphasizing texture and scale rather than human presence—the mood should convey endurance worn thin, not despair.",
