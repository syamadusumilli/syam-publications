  "prompt": "A weathered kitchen table in a rural farmhouse, morning light streaming through a window, scattered with handwritten letters, old photographs, a coffee mug, and a framed picture of younger family members—some present, some absent. The composition should be overhead or at a shallow angle, showing the textures of aged wood and worn objects that tell stories of migration, return, and change. Soft golden light creates long shadows across the table's surface, emphasizing the passage of time and the complex movements of people within a single family's history. The mood should feel contemplative and grounded, capturing the quiet dignity of lives lived across distances and generations.",
