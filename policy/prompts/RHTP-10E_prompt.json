  "prompt": "A photograph taken from inside a weathered pickup truck on a red clay county road at dawn, looking through the windshield toward dense pine forest under pale gray-gold light. The truck's dashboard and steering wheel visible in soft focus in the foreground. A mailbox or worn fence post marking a property line along the roadside. The composition emphasizes the intimate, personal geography of place—the kind of morning commute repeated thousands of times in communities that know themselves but remain unnamed in policy. Muted ochre, deep green, and slate tones. Documentary photojournalism aesthetic, quiet and observational, conveying both solitude and deep rootedness to land.",
