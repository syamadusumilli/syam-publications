  "prompt": "A wide-angle landscape shot of Arizona high desert at golden hour, capturing miles of sparse scrubland and distant mountain ridges under soft amber light, with a weathered wooden fence line or rural utility poles cutting through the foreground to emphasize vast distances and isolation. In the middle distance, a small cluster of buildings—a rural clinic, community center, or scattered homesteads—barely visible against the expansive terrain, suggesting the challenge of serving dispersed populations across immense geography. Shot in documentary style with muted earth tones—ochres, dusty blues, pale greens—evoking both the beauty and the austere reality of rural healthcare delivery across 113,000 square miles.",
