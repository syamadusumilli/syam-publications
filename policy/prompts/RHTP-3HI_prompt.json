  "prompt": "A silhouetted figure standing on a rocky Hawaiian coastline at dawn, looking across empty ocean channels toward distant islands on the horizon, with a small clinic or medical facility visible in soft focus on the near shore—conveying isolation, separation by water rather than land, and the quiet weight of geographic fragmentation. Warm golden light breaks through morning clouds, casting long shadows across volcanic terrain and weathered wooden structures. Documentary photojournalism style, emphasizing the physical reality of island-based healthcare barriers through landscape and environment rather than people or clinical settings.",
