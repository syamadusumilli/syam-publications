  "prompt": "A rural county road stretching toward the horizon under soft golden afternoon light, with empty fields on either side and a distant small-town water tower barely visible through haze. In the foreground, an aged road sign or mailbox suggests human presence, but no people are visible—convey isolation through landscape scale and emptiness rather than human drama. Shoot in warm, desaturated tones with documentary-style composition emphasizing distance and absence, the kind of photograph that captures what is not there rather than what is.",
