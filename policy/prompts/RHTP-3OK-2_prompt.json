  "prompt": "A wide-angle photograph of a rural Oklahoma landscape at golden hour, with a two-lane county road stretching toward the horizon through mixed grassland and sparse trees, a weathered wooden fence line in the foreground, and distant farmsteads. Overlay subtle compositional elements—a clipboard or documents resting on a pickup truck bed in soft focus in the lower frame, hands of unidentified people reviewing papers at a wooden table in a small-town community center, captured from above with warm afternoon light filtering through old windows. The mood should convey quiet determination and the tangible weight of planning amid vast rural geography—documentary photography that captures the scale of the challenge and the texture of collaborative work across Oklahoma's landscape.",
