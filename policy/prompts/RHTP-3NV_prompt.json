  "prompt": "A wide-angle photograph of a desert highway stretching toward distant mountains at golden hour, with a single-story rural clinic or small hospital visible off the roadside—its modest brick or stucco structure weathered but maintained. The foreground shows an empty two-lane road with mile markers, emphasizing vast distance. Warm amber and rust tones dominate; late afternoon sun casts long shadows across the landscape. The composition conveys isolation without despair—the clinical building stands as a quiet anchor in the emptiness, dignified and purposeful. Shot in documentary photojournalism style, slightly desaturated, capturing the textured reality of frontier healthcare geography.",
