  "prompt": "A wide landscape photograph of high desert terrain at golden hour—muted rust and ochre tones in exposed earth and rock formations—with a paved county road stretching toward distant mesa silhouettes. In the foreground, a pickup truck shot from behind, its bed visible, moving along the empty road. Overcast sky with warm light breaking through. The composition emphasizes vast, bordered space and isolation. Documentary photojournalism style, grainy texture, no people visible. Mood: quiet dignity, the weight of distance and territorial scale.",
