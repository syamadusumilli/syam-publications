  "prompt": "A worn wooden table in a rural clinic's waiting room, scattered with medical charts, clipboards, and handwritten notes beside a cup of coffee; soft golden afternoon light streams through a window, casting long shadows across the documents; the composition includes a pair of hands in work-worn sleeves reviewing papers, with blurred rural landscape visible through glass behind—conveying the careful, methodical work of translating evidence into practice in resource-limited settings.
