  "prompt": "A wide-angle photograph taken from a county road at golden hour, showing vast wheat fields stretching to a distant horizon under an overcast sky, with a weathered grain elevator or ranch structure silhouetted in the middle distance and a single vehicle or figure barely visible on the road—emphasizing emptiness and scale. Shot in documentary style with muted ochre and gray tones, conveying quiet desolation without sentimentality, the landscape itself as the subject rather than human activity.",
