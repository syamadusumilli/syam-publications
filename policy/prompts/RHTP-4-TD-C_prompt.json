  "prompt": "A high school student sits at a worn kitchen table with college brochures and healthcare career pamphlets spread before them, hands resting on open pages, warm afternoon light streaming through a farmhouse window casting long shadows across the materials. The composition captures only hands and the table's surface, with blurred rural landscape visible through the window behind, conveying quiet contemplation about a distant future and the weight of long educational pathways ahead. Shot in documentary style with muted golden tones, emphasizing the texture of the moment—the passage of time, choice, and the gap between aspiration and realistic timelines.",
