  "prompt": "A weathered tobacco curing barn with vertical wooden slats stands at the edge of a rolling Piedmont hillside, shot from a distance across fallow fields in golden late-afternoon light. The composition includes a farmer's hands gripping a weathered fence rail in the immediate foreground, with the barn and bare pasture receding behind, emphasizing the weight of inherited land and abandoned tradition. Earth tones dominate—rust-red soil, gray barn wood, golden grass—with soft shadows lengthening across the field. The mood is contemplative and understated, conveying quiet loss and resilience without sentimentality, photographed with the documentary clarity and muted palette of regional photojournalism.",
