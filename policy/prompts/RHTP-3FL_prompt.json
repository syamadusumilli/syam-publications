  "prompt": "A weathered rural clinic or small-town health center in interior Florida—perhaps in the Panhandle or around Lake Okeechobee—photographed in late afternoon golden light. Composition should show the building's entrance or waiting area from a distance or oblique angle, with rural landscape visible beyond: pine trees, agricultural fields, or unpaved roads. Include subtle details of wear and care: a hand holding paperwork near a worn reception desk (shot from overhead or side angle to obscure faces), an empty waiting room chair, a community bulletin board with notices. Mood is quiet, dignified, slightly austere—conveying the weight of stretched resources and geographic isolation without despair. Photograph in documentary style with warm, muted tones and soft natural light, emphasizing texture and the lived reality of rural healthcare infrastructure.",
