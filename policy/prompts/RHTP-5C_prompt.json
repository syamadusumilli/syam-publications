  "prompt": "A wide-angle photograph of a rural county administrative building's hallway or meeting room, early morning light streaming through large windows illuminating a wooden conference table with scattered papers, notebooks, and a coffee cup—the materials of local governance and healthcare planning. Shot from a low angle or overhead perspective that emphasizes the worn wooden surfaces and authentic textures of the space, with soft shadows creating depth. The composition should feel documentary and observational, capturing the quiet weight of administrative work in rural America, with warm golden-hour or early-morning light enhancing the earth tones of wood, paper, and institutional furnishings. No people visible, only the traces of their work—suggest deliberation, coordination, and the unglamorous infrastructure of healthcare transformation at the local level.",
