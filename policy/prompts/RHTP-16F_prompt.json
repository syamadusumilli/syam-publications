  "prompt": "A weathered wooden table in a small-town community center or church basement, scattered with hand-drawn maps, printed resources, and coffee cups, captured in warm afternoon light from tall windows casting long shadows across the surface.

The mood is earnest and practical—textures of paper, wood grain, and faded coffee stains suggest modest resources and determined action. Shot in documentary style with natural, unmanipulated light and shallow depth of field keeping focus on the tangible work of planning.",
