  "prompt": "A rural county road stretching toward the horizon at golden hour, with weathered fence posts and overgrown fields on either side; an abandoned or shuttered building visible in the middle distance, shot from a moving vehicle, conveying quiet emptiness and institutional absence rather than drama. Muted ochre and grey tones, soft late-afternoon light casting long shadows across asphalt cracked at its edges. The composition emphasizes scale and distance—the vastness of rural space made hollow by infrastructure loss. Documentary photography style, no people visible, capturing the texture of structural disinvestment through landscape and light rather than explicit narrative.",
