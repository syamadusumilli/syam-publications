  "prompt": "A weathered farmhouse kitchen table at dawn, scattered with hand-written notes, a cup of coffee, and reading glasses, with soft golden light streaming through a window revealing vast, flat Sandhills grassland beyond. Shot from a low angle emphasizing the worn wood grain and the expansive plains visible through the pane, conveying quiet resilience and the intersection of domestic life with agricultural landscape.
