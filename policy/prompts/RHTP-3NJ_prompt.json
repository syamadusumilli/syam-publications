  "prompt": "A narrow country road winds through dense New Jersey pine forest in soft morning light, with weathered farm fences and mailboxes visible along the shoulder; the composition emphasizes the surprising isolation and tree-lined emptiness despite the state's overall density, shot from a low angle that exaggerates the rural quietude, with muted greens and grays dominating the frame in a contemplative, understated documentary style. No people visible—only the physical evidence of dispersed rural settlement carved into densely forested terrain.",
