  "prompt": "A worn wooden desk in a small-town clinic waiting room, morning light filtering through large windows casting long shadows across scattered pamphlets about health services and community programs. In soft focus, hands of a healthcare worker organizing patient files or paperwork, with rural landscape visible through the window behind—open fields and a distant tree line. The scene captures quiet institutional care and long-established community infrastructure, shot with documentary precision in muted greens and warm grays, emphasizing the accumulated weight of decades of rural health work.",
