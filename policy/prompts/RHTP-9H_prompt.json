  "prompt": "A worn wooden table in a modest kitchen, late afternoon light streaming through a lace-curtained window, casting soft shadows across hands gathered together—perhaps sorting through bills, mending, or preparing a shared meal. In the soft focus background, visible through the window, a quiet main street with aging storefronts and mountains in the distance. The composition should feel intimate and documentary, capturing quiet dignity and the weight of everyday persistence, with muted greens, browns, and golden light that suggests both hardship and endurance without sentimentality.",
