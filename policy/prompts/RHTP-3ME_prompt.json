  "prompt": "A weathered wooden porch overlooking a rural Maine road at golden hour, with an elderly person's hands resting on the railing in soft focus—worn wedding band visible—looking toward distant pine forests under overcast sky.

Muted greens, grays, and warm amber light; the texture of age and endurance without sentimentality.",
