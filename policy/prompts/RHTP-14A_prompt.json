  "prompt": "A rural clinic waiting room or community health center interior shot at golden hour, with soft light streaming through large windows illuminating empty chairs, a modest desk with a computer screen, and medical equipment arranged for modest local care—the composition emphasizes quietness and readiness rather than activity, shot from a low angle or side perspective that conveys dignity and functionality without showing faces, with warm wood tones and muted colors dominating the frame to suggest infrastructure built for patience and presence rather than throughput.",
