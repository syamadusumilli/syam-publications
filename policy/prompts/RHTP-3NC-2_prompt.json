  "prompt": "A wide-angle photograph of a rural North Carolina county road at golden hour, with farmland stretching to the horizon and a small-town water tower visible in the distance, the foreground showing weathered utility poles and road markings that suggest connection and infrastructure. Overhead view of a worn wooden table in a community center or church hall with scattered maps, documents, and handwritten notes about regional coordination, hands of two people (out of focus, anonymous) pointing to different areas, morning light streaming through large windows casting long shadows across the papers. Documentary photojournalism style with muted greens, browns, and grays, emphasizing the texture of institutional bureaucracy meeting rural landscape—quiet, methodical, the weight of systemic change visible in the details rather than drama.",
