  "prompt": "A weathered kitchen table in a modest rural home during golden hour, with an older person's hands resting on the surface beside a glass of water, their face out of frame. Soft, warm light streams through a nearby window, casting long shadows across worn wood grain. In the soft focus background, a calendar on the wall and a prescription bottle are barely visible. The composition conveys quiet discomfort and the solitary nature of untreated dental pain in places far from care. Shot in documentary photojournalism style with muted earth tones and natural texture.",
