  "prompt": "A weathered rural Kentucky landscape at golden hour, with a small-town main street visible in soft focus in the background and a county road stretching toward tree-lined horizons in warm amber light. In the foreground, hands-only shot of someone holding medical paperwork or a clipboard near a worn wooden porch railing or truck bed, suggesting the weight of healthcare decisions.
