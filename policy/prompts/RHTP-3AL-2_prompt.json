  "prompt": "A wide overhead shot of a worn wooden table in a rural Alabama kitchen or community center, with hands of two or three people (partially visible, no faces) reviewing documents and maps marked with county boundaries and healthcare coverage areas. Morning light streams through a nearby window, casting long shadows across spreadsheets and handwritten notes. The scene captures quiet deliberation and collaborative problem-solving, with visible details of rural life—coffee cups, worn furniture, faded wallpaper—suggesting the weight of systemic challenge and determined local engagement. Shot in documentary style with rich, muted earth tones and natural imperfection.",
