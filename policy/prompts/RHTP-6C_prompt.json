  "prompt": "A rural county road at golden hour stretching toward distant farmland, with a small clinic or health center visible in the middle distance—its windows warm with interior light. In the foreground, slightly out of focus, are hands holding a tablet or folder of papers, suggesting the weight of data management and coordination work. The composition emphasizes the isolation and distance between rural care sites, with muted greens and earth tones. Shot in documentary style with shallow depth of field, conveying both the infrastructure challenge and quiet determination of rural health work.",
