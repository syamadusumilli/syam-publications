  "prompt": "A weathered wooden table in a rural Connecticut kitchen, photographed in soft morning light from above, with a cup of coffee, scattered papers showing health initiative notes, and a window revealing farmland or wooded hills in soft focus behind. The composition captures the texture of rural community organizing—humble, practical, rooted—with muted greens and warm cream tones, evoking quiet determination rather than crisis. Documentary-style, intimate but not intrusive, conveying strategic local work happening at human scale.",
