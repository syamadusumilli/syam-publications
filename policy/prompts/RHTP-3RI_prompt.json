  "prompt": "A weathered ferry dock at dawn, morning mist rising off gray Atlantic water, with a small passenger vessel moored against wooden pilings worn smooth by decades of use. In the foreground, a solitary figure in a heavy jacket stands at the railing, hands gripped around a thermos, gazing toward the distant shoreline barely visible through the haze. The composition emphasizes the textured details—rope, salt-stained wood, the ferry's metal railings—shot from a low angle that conveys both the isolation and quiet resilience of island communities. Muted blues, grays, and amber tones from pre-dawn light create a contemplative, documentary-realism mood that captures the reality of separation by water rather than by miles.",
