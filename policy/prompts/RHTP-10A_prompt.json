  "prompt": "A winding mountain road cutting through misty Appalachian ridges at dawn, with weathered fence posts and bare trees framing the composition, shot from a low angle emphasizing the endless chain of hills receding into soft fog—warm ochre and slate tones, the quiet weight of interconnected terrain that ignores state borders, documentary style with shallow depth of field on foreground details like a mail carrier's hand on a steering wheel or utility lines crossing the frame, conveying isolation and the material reality of a region that functions as one body despite fragmented governance.",
