  "prompt": "A worn wooden conference table in afternoon light streaming through tall windows, scattered with papers and a laptop showing healthcare data charts, an empty coffee cup, and a stethoscope coiled at the edge of the frame. A silhouetted figure sits alone at the head of the table, hands folded, facing away from camera toward a window overlooking a quiet Kentucky hillside with bare trees and distant farmland. The room has institutional but aging quality—water-stained ceiling tiles visible above, wooden paneling, a calendar on the wall. Golden-hour light creates long shadows across the table and floor, emphasizing stillness and contemplation rather than crisis. Documentary photography style with shallow depth of field, capturing the texture of worn surfaces and the weight of difficult decisions made in small-town institutional spaces.",
