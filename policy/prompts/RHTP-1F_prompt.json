  "prompt": "A weathered farmstand or kitchen table in golden afternoon light, laden with commodity crops—corn, soybeans, wheat—alongside empty grocery bags or a sparse collection of processed foods, shot from above to emphasize the contrast between agricultural abundance and limited access. The composition should feel like documentary reportage, with soft shadows and warm, muted earth tones, capturing the quiet tension between rural productivity and food scarcity without any people visible. Include details like worn hands reaching toward produce, a truck bed loaded with harvest, or the edge of an empty country road stretching toward distant fields—all shot with the unflinching, textured clarity of photojournalism rather than the artifice of stock imagery.",
