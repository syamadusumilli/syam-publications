  "prompt": "A wide-angle photograph taken from inside a small-town main street clinic or community health center at early morning light, showing empty chairs in a waiting area with worn upholstery, a clipboard and sign-in sheet on a side table catching soft golden light through large windows, distant rural landscape visible through glass—the composition emphasizes the quiet infrastructure of care serving sparse populations, with muted earth tones and morning shadows conveying both the dignity and strain of rural healthcare delivery. Shot in documentary style, no people visible, focus on the textures of waiting and service.",
