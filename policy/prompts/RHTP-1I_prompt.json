  "prompt": "A weathered wooden table in a rural kitchen, morning light streaming through a window, with hands of two people across from each other—one holding a worn Bible or notebook, the other a cup of coffee—suggesting quiet conversation and the weight of lived belief. The scene captures the texture of daily rural life: worn tablecloth, simple furnishings, natural light revealing dust and time. Shot from a low angle emphasizing the intimacy and dignity of the moment, with soft focus on the background to ground the viewer in this space of faith and decision-making.",
