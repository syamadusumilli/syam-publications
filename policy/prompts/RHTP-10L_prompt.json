  "prompt": "A weathered wooden porch or kitchen table in soft morning light, with hands of an older person—weathered, capable—resting near a cup of coffee, reading glasses, or a handwritten letter; tall white pine forest visible through a window or doorway behind them, out of focus. The composition should feel intimate but not intrusive, capturing quiet daily life in a small New England town—perhaps a worn quilt, vintage woodstove, or calendar on the wall visible at the edges. Shot with a documentary photographer's eye: natural, unhurried, warm golden-hour or diffused morning light filtering through old glass, emphasizing texture, age, and the dignity of aging in place within forested, close-knit rural communities.",
