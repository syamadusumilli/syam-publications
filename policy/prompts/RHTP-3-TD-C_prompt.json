  "prompt": "A weathered county courthouse or administrative building in a non-expansion state, captured from a low angle showing worn brick and a flag, with morning light casting long shadows across the steps. Empty folding chairs arranged in a sparse community room or county office hallway suggest waiting, bureaucracy, and administrative processes. Shallow depth of field with soft focus on architectural details—door frames, bulletin boards with papers, file cabinets—creating a sense of institutional complexity and administrative burden. Documentary black-and-white or desaturated color palette with cool, muted tones emphasizing the weight of policy and its quiet impact on rural infrastructure.",
