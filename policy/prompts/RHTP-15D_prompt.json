  "prompt": "A rural county road stretching toward the horizon at golden hour, with weathered fence lines dividing farmland, a distant grain elevator, and a small clinic or community building visible but not prominent—shot from a low angle to emphasize the expanse and interconnectedness of the landscape, with muted greens and earth tones.

Documentary photography style with natural, flat lighting.",
