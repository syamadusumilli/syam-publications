  "prompt": "A weathered kitchen table at dawn, with a steaming cup of coffee and a plate of eggs beside a window showing pre-sunrise darkness over distant fields; hands of an unidentifiable person reaching for the coffee mug, their work jacket draped over a chair back; soft warm light from a single overhead fixture casting long shadows across worn wood surfaces and faded checkered tablecloth, conveying the quiet solitude and routine of a rural morning before work begins.
