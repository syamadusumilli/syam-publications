  "prompt": "A dusty rural intersection at dusk where a worn two-lane highway crosses perpendicular to another, with utility poles stretching toward the horizon under soft golden light. In the middle distance, a small pharmacy storefront with faded signage sits on one corner, its windows catching the last rays of day. A pickup truck approaches from one direction, another vehicle recedes in the opposite direction—suggesting movement and crossing. The foreground shows a worn asphalt surface with faint painted lines, suggesting constant traffic and passage. Shot from a low, ground-level perspective with deep depth of field, conveying the liminal, transitional character of a place where daily movement and commerce flow across an invisible boundary, with muted earth tones and the grain of documentary photography.",
