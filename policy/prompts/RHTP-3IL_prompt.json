  "prompt": "A worn gravel county road stretching toward the horizon under soft golden late-afternoon light, with Illinois farmland rolling gently on both sides—silos and agricultural equipment visible in the distance.

The composition conveys quiet acknowledgment of distance and resource scarcity.",
