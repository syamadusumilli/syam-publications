  "prompt": "A wide landscape photograph of a rural Texas county road at golden hour, stretching toward distant hills under soft, hazy light. In the foreground, weathered utility poles line the asphalt; a single vehicle moves along the empty road in the middle distance. The composition emphasizes vast, underdeveloped space—sparse trees, ranch fencing, dry grassland—conveying both isolation and resilience. Documentary photojournalism style with warm, muted earth tones and natural shadows, no people visible, capturing the scale and texture of rural infrastructure and geography that defines Texas health access challenges.",
