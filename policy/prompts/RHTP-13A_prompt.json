  "prompt": "A weathered rural clinic building photographed from a distance in soft afternoon light, its empty parking lot cracked and overgrown, the faded rectangular outline of a removed sign still visible on the exterior wall. In the foreground, a pickup truck or car passing by on a county road, shot from a low angle to suggest the perspective of someone driving past daily. Muted greens and grays dominate; the sky overcast and heavy. The composition conveys quiet abandonment and the residue of broken promises—no people visible, only the material evidence of institutional failure and the ongoing rhythm of rural life around it.",
