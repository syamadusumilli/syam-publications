  "prompt": "A wide-angle photograph of a modest conference room in a rural town, shot from the doorway at golden hour with warm light streaming through large windows. Around a worn wooden table sit silhouetted figures in business casual dress—shoulders and hands visible, papers and notebooks spread before them—engaged in what appears to be serious discussion. The room shows authentic details: a water pitcher, coffee mugs, maps or charts on the wall, the kind of quiet institutional space where policy work happens. Muted earth tones dominate; the lighting creates long shadows across the table, conveying weight and consequence rather than optimism. Shot in documentary photojournalism style with shallow depth of field, emphasizing the texture of the moment—the tension between collaboration and competing interests—without sentimentality or dramatic framing.",
