  "prompt": "A weathered wooden table in a small-town diner or community room, scattered with printed regulatory documents, coffee cups, and handwritten notes, photographed from above in soft morning light streaming through a window. The composition captures the texture of rural bureaucracy—official papers meeting everyday spaces—with shallow depth of field that keeps the documents in focus while blurring the humble setting beyond. The mood is serious but not heavy: the weight of necessary change, the tangible friction between rules written elsewhere and the reality of a community trying to solve its own problems. Documentary photojournalism style, warm earth tones, no people visible.",
