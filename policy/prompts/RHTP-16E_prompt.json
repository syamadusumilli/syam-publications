  "prompt": "A weathered wooden table in a rural kitchen or community center, scattered with worn notebooks, budget spreadsheets, and hand-drawn infrastructure diagrams, captured in soft afternoon light filtering through a window. A pair of hands—belonging to an administrator or community leader—pointing to notes or maps showing long-term planning timelines stretching across years. The composition emphasizes the texture of paper, wood, and worn materials, with warm earth tones and muted light that conveys the weight of sustained planning and the quiet determination required to build systems meant to endure decades. Documentary-style, intimate framing that suggests thoughtful deliberation rather than urgency.",
