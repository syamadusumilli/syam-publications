  "prompt": "A weathered single-story rural clinic building photographed from across an empty main street at golden hour, its windows glowing amber, a solitary truck parked outside, the storefront showing modest signage barely legible in the soft light. The composition emphasizes isolation and quiet dignity—wide angle, slight underexposure to suggest evening fatigue, with utility poles and bare trees framing the structure. Foreground blurred, soft depth of field. The mood should convey dedication worn thin by time, essential but fragile, documented with the stillness of photojournalism rather than nostalgia.",
