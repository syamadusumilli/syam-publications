  "prompt": "A wide landscape photograph of a sparse Intermountain valley at golden hour, showing a distant ribbon of asphalt road cutting through sagebrush and grassland toward low mountains on the horizon, with a single utility pole and a small building barely visible in the middle distance—emphasizing vast distances and isolation. Shot from ground level with warm, muted tones dominating the frame (ochre, dusty greens, soft grays), documentary style with natural depth of field, conveying the scale disparity between human infrastructure and landscape.",
