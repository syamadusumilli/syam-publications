  "prompt": "An unpaved ranch road stretching across high desert scrubland toward distant mountains under late afternoon light, with weathered wooden fence posts and sparse vegetation in the foreground, the road itself rutted and textured; simultaneously visible in the middle distance, a small cluster of ranch buildings with aging structures casting long shadows, conveying isolation and sparse settlement. Shot from a low angle along the road surface to emphasize the distance and emptiness, with warm golden-hour light creating long shadows and muted ochre, sage green, and gray tones. The composition should feel lonely but dignified, documentary-style, capturing the texture of genuine rural infrastructure rather than scenic beauty.",
