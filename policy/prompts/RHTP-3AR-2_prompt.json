  "prompt": "A weathered wooden table in a rural Arkansas kitchen or community center, mid-morning light streaming through a window, scattered with papers, maps of county regions, and a cup of coffee—hands of an unidentified person pointing to areas on a map or document, suggesting planning and coordination. The scene captures the texture of rural life: worn wood, natural light, modest furnishings. Soft, muted color palette with warm beige, sage, and earth tones. Shot from above or side angle to show the work surface and hands without revealing faces. The mood is quiet, purposeful, and grounded—conveying deliberate community planning and long-term strategy rather than crisis or urgency.",
