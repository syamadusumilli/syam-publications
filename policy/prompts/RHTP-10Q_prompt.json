  "prompt": "A small aircraft window frame capturing the vast, treeless tundra landscape below at golden hour, with a thin ribbon of river visible through morning mist, taken from inside the plane—conveying isolation and distance as geography rather than hardship. Muted greens and grays dominate; in the foreground, a weathered hand grips the seat armrest, suggesting the journey itself as the healthcare access story. Documentary-style, grainy and warm, with soft bokeh on distant terrain.",
