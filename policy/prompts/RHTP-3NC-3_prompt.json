  "prompt": "A wide-angle photograph of a rural North Carolina county road at golden hour, with a modest brick health clinic or community center visible in the mid-distance set against flat farmland and pine trees, morning mist still clinging to fields in the background. In the foreground, hands of an unidentifiable person holding a folder or clipboard with local health initiative materials, suggesting coordination and planning work. Warm, diffused sunlight casting long shadows across the asphalt, conveying quiet determination and the weight of infrastructure-building amid resource constraints. Photojournalistic, unhurried composition emphasizing the texture of rural institutional life—no people visible, no clinical sterility, just the material reality of a small-town health coordination effort.",
