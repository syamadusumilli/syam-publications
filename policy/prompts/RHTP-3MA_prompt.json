  "prompt": "A weathered wooden sign for a small rural hospital or clinic stands along a quiet Massachusetts country road lined with bare or early-spring trees, golden morning light casting long shadows across the asphalt. The composition captures the sign from a low angle showing worn lettering and peeling paint, with farmland or forest receding into soft focus behind it, conveying decades of service and the quiet persistence of rural healthcare infrastructure. Shot in documentary style with muted greens and browns, the image evokes both the isolation and resilience of rural communities navigating healthcare access across dispersed geography.",
