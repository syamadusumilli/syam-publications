  "prompt": "A weathered rural clinic waiting room photographed in soft morning light, with empty chairs and a registration desk visible in soft focus; an overhead shot of unfilled paperwork scattered across a wooden table in warm, diffused sunlight, emphasizing absence rather than activity; the scene captures quiet administrative space designed for patients no longer arriving, with muted beige and gray tones, shot in documentary photojournalism style that conveys dignity and structural readiness meeting coverage uncertainty.",
