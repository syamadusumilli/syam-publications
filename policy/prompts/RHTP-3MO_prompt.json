  "prompt": "A weathered county road cutting through rolling Ozark hills at golden hour, lined with bare or sparse trees, with a small-town silhouette and church steeple visible on the distant horizon; in the immediate foreground, hands gripping a steering wheel or resting on a porch railing, suggesting the perspective of someone navigating rural Missouri's geography.
