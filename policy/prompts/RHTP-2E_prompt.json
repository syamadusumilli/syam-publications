  "prompt": "A wide-angle photograph of a rural clinic entrance nestled against landscape, taken during early morning light with long shadows.

In the foreground, hands of a healthcare worker or community member arrange papers or medical supplies on a worn table—only hands and forearms visible. The composition emphasizes the building's integration into the landscape rather than clinical sterility, with native vegetation and unpaved or gravel surfaces visible. Golden hour warmth casts the scene in muted ochres and soft grays, conveying decades of institutional presence and community trust rather than newness or corporate efficiency.",
