  "prompt": "A wide-angle photograph of a rural crossroads at dusk, showing a weathered two-lane highway stretching toward the horizon with a small cluster of buildings visible in the distance—a grain elevator, a church steeple, scattered farmhouses. Foreground captures a worn road sign or mile marker in soft focus. Golden hour light casts long shadows across fields, emphasizing the vast distances between settlements. The composition should convey isolation and scale without melancholy—a sense of the landscape itself as the subject. Shot in documentary style with muted greens, golds, and grays, evoking the complexity of defining and measuring space across diverse rural geographies.",
