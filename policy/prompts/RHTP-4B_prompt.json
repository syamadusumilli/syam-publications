  "prompt": "A weathered rural clinic or small-town medical office seen through a window at golden hour, with soft warm light casting long shadows across empty waiting room chairs and a reception desk; in the foreground, an out-of-focus hand holding a job posting or letter on the counter, suggesting arrival or departure; the composition should feel documentary and intimate, capturing the quiet tension between institutional space and the human decision to stay or leave, shot with shallow depth of field and muted earth tones that convey both hope and the weight of difficult choices.",
