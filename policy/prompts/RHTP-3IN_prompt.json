  "prompt": "A weathered rural hospital building stands alone on a county road lined with autumn fields at golden hour, its brick facade catching warm light while the surrounding farmland stretches into soft focus behind it; photograph from a distance emphasizing the institution's isolation and quiet resilience, with a mailbox or road sign in the foreground suggesting the small-town geography of Indiana's heartland.
