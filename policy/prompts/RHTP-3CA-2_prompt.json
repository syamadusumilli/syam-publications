  "prompt": "A wide overhead shot of a county road intersection in the Central Valley at golden hour, with farmland stretching to the horizon and a small cluster of buildings visible in the distance—a rural clinic, grain silos, and a water tower. In the immediate foreground, hands spread across a worn map marked with red pins and pencil lines indicating regional hub locations and spoke routes connecting distant towns. Soft, diffused late-afternoon light casts long shadows across the map and surrounding wooden table. The photograph conveys quiet coordination and strategic reach across vast geography, with the texture of rural infrastructure and the weight of complex planning work rendered in documentary style.",
