  "prompt": "A wide-angle photograph of an empty Oklahoma county road at golden hour, lined with sparse trees and distant farmland under a vast sky, taken from a low angle to emphasize the landscape's isolation and scale; in the immediate foreground, a weathered wooden utility pole casts a long shadow across the asphalt, its worn surface catching warm light. The composition should feel documentary and contemplative rather than dramatic, with muted earth tones and soft atmospheric haze suggesting both distance and the weight of rural infrastructure. No people visible, but the emptiness should convey absence and challenge rather than peace.",
