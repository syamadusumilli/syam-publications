  "prompt": "A weathered wooden table in a modest kitchen, morning light streaming through a window, scattered with papers—health insurance forms, hospital bills, utility notices—alongside a cooling cup of coffee. The composition captures hands (partially visible) sorting through documents with visible tension, the background showing a modest rural home interior with worn cabinets and peeling paint.
