  "prompt": "A wide landscape photograph of an Iowa county road stretching toward the horizon at golden hour, flanks lined with corn fields in late summer, with a small Critical Access Hospital or rural clinic building visible in the middle distance, its modest brick structure catching warm light. In the foreground, an over-the-shoulder view of a person's hands on a steering wheel or resting on a fence post, suggesting the daily travel distances rural residents navigate for care. Muted greens and golds dominate, with soft shadows across the fields; the mood should convey quiet persistence and the scale of rural geography rather than hardship. Documentary-style photography with shallow depth of field, emphasizing the relationship between landscape, infrastructure, and community.",
