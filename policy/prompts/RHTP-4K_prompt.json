  "prompt": "A rural county road at golden hour, shot from inside a stationary ambulance through the windshield, dashboard visible in soft focus. The road stretches empty toward distant hills under warm, hazy light. A single mailbox or farmhouse visible far down the road. The composition emphasizes vast distance and isolation—the visual weight of those 15, 20, or 30 minutes made tangible through landscape. Documentary photography style, muted earth tones, no people or vehicles in motion, quiet and contemplative rather than dramatic.",
