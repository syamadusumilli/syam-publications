  "prompt": "A weathered wooden table in a modest kitchen, morning light streaming through a window, where an older woman's hands rest near a cup of coffee and scattered papers—documents, notes, perhaps letters—her face out of frame. The room shows the texture of long inhabitation: worn linoleum, faded curtains, a calendar on the wall. Capture the stillness and quiet authority of someone who knows her community deeply, with the documentary precision of a photograph taken without performance or staging, conveying accumulated knowledge and lived experience rather than need or deficit.",
