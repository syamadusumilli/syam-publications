  "prompt": "A worn wooden table in a rural community center or church basement, scattered with handwritten notes, documents, and a cup of coffee catching golden afternoon light from a window. Hands (one older, one younger) lean over the table in conversation, suggesting collaboration and negotiation, with the soft shadows and warm wooden textures emphasizing the informal, grassroots nature of mutual support. The composition captures the texture of community organizing—authentic, unglamorous, grounded in local knowledge—with shallow depth of field keeping focus on the earnest work of advocacy happening at this ordinary table.",
