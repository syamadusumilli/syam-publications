The composition should feel like documentary photography of an actual policy meeting or analysis workspace, capturing the tactile evidence of administrative boundaries struggling against physical geography. Muted greens, browns, and blues of the map against weathered wood, with shallow depth of field keeping focus on the intersection of human gesture and cartographic contradiction.",
