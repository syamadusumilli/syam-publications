  "prompt": "A community health worker and a rural resident sit at a worn kitchen table in morning light streaming through a window, papers and a cup of coffee between them; the worker's hands gesture while explaining something, the resident listens with attention, their face turned away. The photograph captures the quiet intimacy of translation and trust—no clinical trappings visible, just the texture of lived space: worn wood, faded curtains, the authentic geography of how care actually happens in rural homes. Shot with documentary precision, warm and unhurried, emphasizing the human connection at the boundary between systems and community.",
