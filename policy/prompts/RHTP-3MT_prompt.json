  "prompt": "A wide-angle landscape photograph of a two-lane Montana highway stretching toward distant mountains under early morning light, with sparse ranch fencing visible along the roadside and a single small town's water tower barely visible on the horizon—capturing the vast emptiness and geographic isolation that defines rural healthcare delivery. Shot from a low angle with warm, muted golden light casting long shadows across sagebrush and prairie, conveying both the beauty and the profound distances that separate communities. Documentary photojournalism style, no people visible, emphasizing scale and solitude rather than emptiness.",
