  "prompt": "A weathered rural Ohio hospital or clinic building photographed at golden hour, with soft warm light casting long shadows across its brick façade and modest entrance. Include a pickup truck or sedan parked nearby, and capture the surrounding landscape—flat fields or tree lines in soft focus beyond. Frame the shot from a distance that emphasizes the building's isolation and modest scale against the landscape, with no people visible. The light should be honest and unflinching, revealing the texture of aging infrastructure without sentimentality, conveying quiet vulnerability and the weight of serving a dispersed population.",
