  "prompt": "A wide landscape photograph of a North Dakota county road stretching toward a distant horizon under soft morning light, with golden prairie grassland on either side, a single rural mailbox visible in the middle distance, and a small farmhouse or clinic structure barely perceptible on the far horizon. The composition emphasizes vast empty space and geographic isolation, shot from a low angle to convey the scale of the frontier. Muted earth tones—ochre, sage, pale gold—with cool shadows in the foreground. Documentary photography style, capturing the texture of rural infrastructure and land rather than people, with a quiet sense of opportunity and scale.",
