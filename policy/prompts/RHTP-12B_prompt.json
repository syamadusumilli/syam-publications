  "prompt": "A weathered kitchen table in a modest rural home, morning light streaming through a window casting long shadows across worn wood. An older pair of hands sorting through papers and bills beside an empty grocery bag, a single can of beans, and a handwritten calendar. The composition captures the table's edge in sharp focus with blurred rural landscape visible through the window behind—fields or treeline—conveying isolation and constraint. Muted greens, browns, and grays dominate. Shot in documentary photojournalism style with shallow depth of field, emphasizing the weight of daily survival without sentimentality or pathos.",
