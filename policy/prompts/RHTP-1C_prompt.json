  "prompt": "A weathered one-room schoolhouse or small rural school building photographed from a distance at golden hour, with warm amber light casting long shadows across an empty dirt parking lot or gravel drive. In the foreground, a child's hand rests on a worn wooden desk or table inside, books stacked nearby, while through an open window the late afternoon light floods across pages and pencils. The composition should emphasize the solidity and isolation of the building—its presence as a community anchor—with muted ochre and tan tones, peeling paint visible but dignified, surrounded by open land or distant tree lines. Capture the quiet weight of institutional purpose and everyday use, neither romanticized nor diminished.",
