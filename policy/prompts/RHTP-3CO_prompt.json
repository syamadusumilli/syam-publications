  "prompt": "A weathered pickup truck parked on a high plains county road at golden hour, mountains distant on the horizon, with a rural health clinic visible across empty acreage—capture the truck's side mirror and dusty dashboard detail, the long shadows cast by sparse utility poles, and the vastness of land between here and care.
