  "prompt": "A wide-angle photograph of a rural Alabama county road at golden hour, lined with bare or sparse trees, showing a small clinic or health center building in soft focus in the mid-distance, with a pickup truck parked nearby and power lines stretching across the frame; the foreground shows worn asphalt and road markings, the lighting warm and directional, conveying quiet infrastructure and geographic isolation rather than crisis—documentary photojournalism style with muted earth tones and the texture of working rural landscape.",
