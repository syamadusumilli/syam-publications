  "prompt": "A worn kitchen table in a rural farmhouse, morning light streaming through a window onto scattered pill bottles, blood pressure cuff, and a half-filled glass of water—hands of an older person resting nearby, slightly out of focus. The scene captures quiet daily struggle rather than clinical drama, with visible wear on the table surface and soft shadows across diabetes management tools. Photographed from a low angle that emphasizes the texture of rural domesticity and the weight of chronic management, documentary style with natural color grading in warm, muted tones.",
