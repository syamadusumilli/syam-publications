  "prompt": "A rural county road stretching toward the horizon in soft morning light, with a weathered clinic building visible on the left and a shuttered hospital structure on the right, photographed from a vehicle's perspective to suggest movement and diverging paths. Muted golden-hour tones, overcast sky. Include a hand on a steering wheel or map in the foreground, suggesting navigation through fragmented systems. Documentary photojournalism style—candid, textured, slightly unsettling in its composition to convey uncertainty and geographic division.",
