# RHTP 15.B
# The Nomadic Professional Model
## Infrastructure for Professionals Who Serve Multiple Communities

The permanent relocation model for rural workforce has failed. Medical schools train students who do not want to spend careers in isolated communities. Recruitment bonuses attract practitioners who leave after obligations expire. J-1 visa physicians serve required terms and relocate to urban areas. The fundamental assumption that rural healthcare requires professionals permanently living in rural areas no longer holds.

Alternative architecture assumes a different model: **professionals serving multiple communities through rotation and virtual presence**. A physician might spend two days monthly in each of five rural counties, providing procedures and complex care that cannot be virtualized, while offering virtual follow-up and consultation between visits. A behavioral health specialist might rotate through regional service centers on a predictable schedule, building relationships with patients over time without permanent residence.

This nomadic model requires **infrastructure that does not exist**: interstate licensure with automatic practice authority, professional housing networks, employment structures aligned with multi-community practice, compensation models rewarding outcomes rather than presence, and professional community preventing isolation. Building this infrastructure is an enabling condition for workforce sustainability that Article 15A's regulatory transformation cannot achieve alone.

## The Barrier Inventory

Seven infrastructure gaps prevent the nomadic professional model from functioning at scale.

### Interstate Licensure Gaps

Current licensure frameworks assume professionals practice in one state. Even interstate compacts that expedite licensing do not create the seamless practice authority that nomadic professionals need.

The **Interstate Medical Licensure Compact** includes 42 states plus DC and Guam, representing substantial progress since its 2017 launch. Over 49,000 physicians maintain active compact participation, and the compact processed more than 95,000 applications by 2025. But the compact provides **expedited separate licenses**, not automatic practice authority. Physicians still receive individual licenses from each state, pay separate fees, and manage separate renewals.

For a nomadic physician serving communities in Montana, Wyoming, and South Dakota, the current compact requires three separate licenses, three sets of fees, three renewal cycles, and three potential disciplinary exposures. The administrative burden remains substantial even if the application process is faster.

| Compact | States Participating | Mechanism | Limitation |
|---------|---------------------|-----------|------------|
| Interstate Medical Licensure Compact | 42 plus DC/Guam | Expedited separate licenses | Separate fees, renewals, discipline |
| Nurse Licensure Compact | 43 | True multistate license | Gold standard but unique |
| Psychology Interjurisdictional Compact | 45 | Authorization to practice | Annual fees per state |
| Physical Therapy Compact | 45 | Compact privilege | Expedited but separate |
| Counseling Compact | 35 | Authority to practice | Still developing |
| Social Work Compact | 25 | Multistate privilege | Limited adoption |

The **Nurse Licensure Compact** demonstrates that true multistate practice authority is achievable. Nurses licensed in one compact state can practice in all 43 compact states without additional licenses, fees, or applications. This model should extend to physicians and other professions but faces resistance from state medical boards protective of regulatory authority and fee revenue.

### Credentialing Fragmentation

Beyond state licensure, **hospital and facility credentialing** creates additional barriers. A physician licensed in multiple states must still be credentialed separately at each hospital where they will practice. Each credentialing process involves primary source verification, peer references, privilege delineation, and committee approval.

| Credentialing Element | Current Process | Barrier Effect | Required Change |
|----------------------|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Primary source verification | Repeated per facility | Duplicate administrative burden | Portable verification |
| Peer references | New references per facility | Reference fatigue | Regional reference systems |
| Privilege delineation | Separate per facility | Inconsistent privileges | Standardized privilege sets |
| Committee review | Separate per facility | Delays deployment | Expedited pathways |
| Ongoing monitoring | Separate per facility | Compliance burden | Centralized monitoring |

A nomadic physician serving five rural hospitals faces five credentialing processes, even if all five hospitals are in the same state with the same license. This multiplied administrative burden deters professionals from nomadic practice.

**Delegated credentialing** and **credentialing verification organizations** provide partial solutions. Some hospital networks accept credentialing from affiliated facilities. Some payers accept verification from centralized organizations. But no comprehensive system enables a professional to be credentialed once for practice at multiple unaffiliated rural facilities.

### Housing Infrastructure Absence

Nomadic professionals need housing in each community they serve. Current options are inadequate: hotels are expensive and often unavailable in small towns, long-term rentals require commitments longer than service periods, and personal property purchase makes no sense for rotating practitioners.

| Housing Challenge | Current State | Effect | Required Solution |
|-------------------|--------------|--------|-------------------|
| Availability | Hotels limited in rural areas | Cannot stay in served communities | Dedicated professional housing |
| Quality | Available options often poor | Deters professionals | Hotel-equivalent amenities |
| Cost | Full hotel or rental rates | Economic disincentive | Subsidized or network-negotiated rates |
| Amenities | Variable connectivity and workspace | Limits productivity | Guaranteed fiber and workspace |
| Convenience | Booking and coordination fragmented | Administrative burden | Centralized reservation system |

The solution is **dedicated professional housing networks**: furnished apartments in served communities with hotel-quality amenities, fast fiber internet, dedicated workspace, and centralized booking systems. Such networks do not exist and would require substantial capital investment to create.

Estimated capital costs for adequate housing networks are significant:

| Component | Specification | Investment Per Unit |
|-----------|---------------|---------------------|
| Housing unit | Furnished professional apartment | $200,000 to $300,000 |
| Technology | Fiber internet, telehealth capability | $5,000 to $10,000 |
| Amenities | Laundry, kitchen, workspace | Included in unit |
| Network density | Unit within 30-minute drive of served community | 3-5 units per professional |
| Management | Professional property management | $500 to $800 monthly per unit |
| Booking system | Centralized reservation platform | $1 to $2 million development |

A regional housing network serving 50 nomadic professionals might require $15 to $20 million in capital investment plus ongoing operating costs. This infrastructure investment has no obvious funder under current healthcare financing.

### Employment Structure Mismatch

Traditional healthcare employment assumes **one employer, one location**. A physician is employed by a hospital or practice, works at that employer's facilities, and receives salary and benefits structured around single-employer relationship.

Nomadic practice requires different structures. A professional serving five communities might be employed by five different organizations, or by a regional entity that contracts with multiple facilities, or as an independent contractor billing each facility separately. Each structure creates complexity.

| Employment Model | Characteristics | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|------------------|----------------|------------|---------------|
| Multiple employers | Separate employment at each facility | Simple relationship per site | Benefit fragmentation, administrative burden |
| Regional health authority | Single employer, multiple practice sites | Unified benefits, simplified administration | Requires regional entity that may not exist |
| Locum tenens agency | Agency employs, contracts to facilities | Administrative simplification | Agency margin increases cost |
| Independent contractor | Professional contracts directly | Maximum flexibility | No benefits, administrative burden |
| Cooperative/collective | Professionals jointly own practice | Shared resources, peer support | Governance complexity |

**Locum tenens agencies** provide the closest current approximation to nomadic employment infrastructure. Agencies employ physicians and other professionals, provide benefits, handle credentialing and compliance, and contract services to facilities. But agency margins increase costs significantly: facilities pay substantial premiums over direct employment rates, and professionals receive less than facilities pay.

A purpose-built employment infrastructure for nomadic professionals would reduce friction: unified benefits regardless of practice site, simplified credentialing across served facilities, centralized scheduling and coordination, and peer support networks. Creating such infrastructure requires organizational innovation that current healthcare entities have not undertaken.

### Compensation Model Misalignment

Payment for healthcare services assumes **presence-based work**: time spent in facility, patients seen, procedures performed. This model does not align with nomadic practice that combines periodic physical presence with ongoing virtual engagement.

| Compensation Element | Current Model | Nomadic Requirement | Gap |
|---------------------|---------------|---------------------|-----|
| Base compensation | Salary or hourly tied to location | Value-based regardless of location | Significant |
| Travel compensation | Minimal or absent | Substantial travel costs | Significant |
| Productivity metrics | Volume at single site | Panel health across sites | Moderate |
| Benefits | Tied to single employer | Portable across employers | Significant |
| Retirement | Employer-specific plans | Portable retirement | Moderate |

Nomadic physicians incur **substantial unreimbursed costs**: travel expenses between communities, time spent in transit that could otherwise be clinical time, housing costs in multiple locations, and technology costs for virtual care between visits. Compensation models designed for facility-based practice do not account for these costs.

**Value-based payment** models could better align compensation with nomadic practice. If a professional is paid for panel health outcomes rather than visit volume, physical presence becomes one tool among several for achieving those outcomes. A nomadic physician managing chronic conditions across five communities could be compensated for diabetes control, hypertension management, and preventive care completion regardless of whether those outcomes are achieved through in-person visits, virtual encounters, or team-based care coordination.

### Professional Community Absence

Healthcare professionals report that **isolation and lack of peer community** are primary reasons for leaving rural practice. Nomadic practice potentially worsens this problem: professionals move between communities without becoming part of any community, losing both geographic community connection and professional peer relationships.

| Community Element | Traditional Practice | Nomadic Challenge | Required Solution |
|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Peer relationships | Colleagues at practice site | Different colleagues at each site | Regional peer networks |
| Professional development | Employer-sponsored | Fragmented across employers | Centralized CE opportunities |
| Mentorship | Senior colleagues at site | No consistent mentors | Regional mentorship programs |
| Social connection | Community membership | Visitor in each community | Nomad peer community |
| Professional identity | Facility affiliation | No primary affiliation | Nomadic professional identity |

A **nomadic professional community** would need to be deliberately constructed. Regional peer networks connecting professionals serving the same geographic area, whether or not they ever practice together. Virtual communities connecting nomadic professionals across the country who share practice patterns and challenges. Professional identity development that frames nomadic practice as desirable career path rather than second-choice arrangement.

### Scheduling and Coordination Complexity

Nomadic practice requires **sophisticated scheduling** across multiple facilities, patient panels, and service types. A professional's schedule must accommodate facility availability, patient needs, travel logistics, and personal sustainability.

| Scheduling Element | Complexity | Current Solution | Required Infrastructure |
|-------------------|------------|------------------|------------------------|
| Facility coordination | Multiple sites with different needs | Manual negotiation | Centralized scheduling platform |
| Patient panel management | Patients across sites | Separate EMR access | Unified patient registry |
| Travel optimization | Minimize unproductive travel time | Individual planning | Route optimization tools |
| Virtual care integration | Balance in-person and virtual | Ad hoc | Integrated scheduling |
| Personal sustainability | Prevent burnout from constant travel | Individual responsibility | Workload management systems |

No comprehensive scheduling infrastructure exists for nomadic practice. Professionals coordinate manually with multiple facilities, manage separate patient panels in separate electronic health records, and plan their own travel logistics. This administrative burden deters nomadic practice even when other barriers are addressed.

## Current Infrastructure Landscape

Elements of nomadic professional infrastructure exist in fragments across healthcare, but no comprehensive system supports the model at scale.

### Locum Tenens Industry

The **locum tenens industry** provides temporary physician staffing to facilities facing vacancies or surges. Estimated at $6 to $8 billion annually, the industry has developed infrastructure for professional deployment across facilities and states.

| Locum Infrastructure | Capability | Limitation |
|---------------------|------------|------------|
| Multi-state credentialing | Agencies manage credentials across states | Agency-specific, not portable |
| Housing coordination | Some agencies arrange housing | Variable quality, additional cost |
| Travel management | Agencies book travel | Focused on individual assignments |
| Malpractice coverage | Agency provides coverage | Coverage gaps between assignments |
| Benefits | Agency provides benefits | Lower than direct employment |

Locum tenens demonstrates that **professionals can serve multiple facilities** with appropriate infrastructure support. But the model has limitations: assignments are typically temporary rather than ongoing relationships, agencies extract substantial margins, and the model serves facility needs rather than community continuity.

A nomadic professional model differs from locum tenens in emphasizing **ongoing relationships** with served communities rather than temporary coverage. The infrastructure needs overlap but are not identical.

### Academic Health Center Outreach

**Academic health centers** operate outreach networks bringing specialists to rural communities. Specialists from medical centers spend scheduled time at rural facilities, providing services unavailable locally while maintaining primary affiliation with the academic center.

| Outreach Model Element | Academic Center Approach | Applicability to Nomadic Model |
|-----------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Employment | Single academic employer | Provides model for regional employment |
| Scheduling | Centrally coordinated | Demonstrates coordination feasibility |
| Housing | Variable, often day trips | Insufficient for sustained presence |
| Credentialing | Academic center handles | Shows expedited credentialing possible |
| Sustainability | Often grant-funded | Financial model unclear |

Academic outreach demonstrates that **periodic presence can provide meaningful access**. A cardiologist visiting a rural community monthly can manage heart failure patients who would otherwise travel hours for appointments. But academic outreach models typically cover specialty services, not primary care, and may not be financially sustainable without grant funding.

### Telehealth-Anchored Practice

Some rural practices have developed **telehealth-anchored models** where professionals maintain relationships with rural communities while living elsewhere. Virtual visits provide ongoing care; periodic in-person visits address needs that cannot be virtualized.

| Telehealth-Anchored Element | Current Capability | Infrastructure Need |
|----------------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Virtual care delivery | Technology mature | Reimbursement parity |
| In-person scheduling | Practice arranges | Regional coordination |
| Patient relationship | Can be maintained virtually | Trust-building visits |
| Procedure capability | Requires in-person | Service center infrastructure |
| Emergency response | Limited virtually | Local backup systems |

Telehealth-anchored practice demonstrates that **physical presence need not be continuous** for effective care relationships. A behavioral health provider who sees patients virtually weekly and in-person quarterly can maintain therapeutic relationships that would be impossible with monthly in-person visits only. But current infrastructure supports individual practice arrangements rather than systematic regional deployment.

## The Enabling Infrastructure

Building infrastructure for nomadic professional practice requires coordinated investment across seven domains.

### Automatic Interstate Practice Authority

**True multistate licensure** should extend the Nurse Licensure Compact model to all healthcare professions. A professional licensed in one compact state should be able to practice in all compact states without additional applications, fees, or administrative burden.

| Professional | Current Compact Status | Required Enhancement |
|--------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Physicians | Expedited licensing via IMLC | Automatic practice authority |
| Physician Assistants | Compact in development | Design for automatic authority |
| Nurse Practitioners | NLC for RNs, APRN compact pending | Extend NLC model to APRNs |
| Psychologists | PSYPACT provides authority | Expand state adoption |
| Counselors | Counseling Compact expanding | Continue expansion |
| Social Workers | Social Work Compact growing | Accelerate adoption |

Federal action could accelerate compact enhancement. Medicare and Medicaid participation requirements could be conditioned on compact membership. Federal grant programs could prioritize states with automatic practice authority. VA and Indian Health Service could model automatic authority for their facilities.

### Portable Credentialing Systems

**Centralized credentialing verification** should enable professionals to credential once for practice at multiple facilities. A national or regional credentialing organization would maintain verified credentials that participating facilities accept without repeating verification.

| Credentialing Element | Current State | Required System |
|----------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Primary source verification | Repeated per facility | Single verification, shared access |
| Peer references | Separate per facility | Regional reference database |
| Privilege standards | Variable per facility | Standardized privilege sets by specialty |
| Committee review | Separate per facility | Expedited acceptance of verified credentials |
| Ongoing monitoring | Separate per facility | Centralized monitoring with facility notification |

The infrastructure exists partially through **credentialing verification organizations** that hospitals can choose to use. Making such organizations mandatory for facilities receiving federal payment would create the network effects needed for comprehensive coverage.

### Regional Housing Networks

**Dedicated professional housing** requires capital investment and ongoing management. Regional health authorities, state agencies, or purpose-built nonprofit organizations could develop and operate housing networks.

| Network Component | Specification | Investment |
|-------------------|---------------|------------|
| Housing units | One and two bedroom furnished apartments | $200,000 to $300,000 per unit |
| Location | Within 30-minute drive of served facility | Scattered site development |
| Amenities | Fiber internet, telehealth capability, workspace | $5,000 to $10,000 per unit |
| Management | Professional property management | $500 to $800 per unit monthly |
| Reservation system | Online booking, availability management | $1 to $2 million platform development |
| Cleaning/turnover | Hotel-standard between occupancies | $100 to $200 per turnover |

A **regional housing network** serving 50 nomadic professionals across a multi-state region might include 150 to 200 housing units (multiple units needed since professionals overlap in service areas), requiring $30 to $50 million in capital investment plus $1.5 to $2 million annually in operating costs.

Funding sources could include USDA rural development programs, state health facility financing authorities, hospital community benefit obligations, and healthcare foundation grants. Operating costs could be recovered through professional rental payments subsidized by employing organizations.

### Regional Employment Entities

**Regional health employment authorities** could provide unified employment for professionals serving multiple facilities within a region. These entities would employ professionals, provide benefits, coordinate scheduling, and contract services to participating facilities.

| Entity Function | Capability | Benefit |
|-----------------|------------|---------|
| Employment | Single employer for multiple practice sites | Benefit continuity, administrative simplification |
| Benefits | Unified health insurance, retirement, leave | Competitive with urban employment |
| Credentialing | Centralized credentialing for all facilities | Reduced administrative burden |
| Scheduling | Coordinate professional deployment | Optimize coverage and travel |
| Contracting | Negotiate facility agreements | Professional volume enables leverage |
| Quality | Monitor outcomes across sites | Aggregate data enables improvement |

Such entities could be structured as **nonprofit corporations, governmental authorities, or professional cooperatives**. Existing regional health organizations, Academic Health Center outreach programs, or state primary care associations could expand to provide employment infrastructure.

### Value-Based Compensation Models

Compensation aligned with nomadic practice would emphasize **panel outcomes rather than visit volume**, travel cost reimbursement, and flexibility across practice sites.

| Compensation Element | Traditional Model | Nomadic Model |
|---------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Base pay | Salary or per-visit | Panel-based capitation |
| Travel | Not compensated | Per-mile or per-trip reimbursement |
| Housing | Not addressed | Housing allowance or network access |
| Productivity | Volume-based bonus | Quality-based bonus |
| Benefits | Employer-provided | Portable benefits package |

**Capitated or value-based arrangements** with payers would enable this compensation structure. A nomadic professional could be paid a per-member-per-month rate for managing a panel across served communities, with outcomes-based bonuses and travel cost coverage.

### Professional Community Infrastructure

**Nomadic professional peer networks** would provide the community connection that isolated rural practice lacks and that nomadic practice risks losing.

| Community Element | Required Infrastructure | Investment |
|-------------------|------------------------|------------|
| Regional peer networks | Regular convenings, shared cases | Meeting costs, coordination |
| Virtual communities | Online platforms, discussion forums | Platform development |
| Mentorship programs | Senior-junior matching, structured support | Program coordination |
| Professional development | Regional CE opportunities, conferences | Event costs |
| Social connection | Nomad gatherings, family support | Community building |

Investment in professional community infrastructure is modest compared to housing or employment infrastructure but essential for workforce sustainability. Regional health organizations, professional associations, or state agencies could host peer networks with minimal additional funding.

### Integrated Scheduling Systems

**Technology platforms** coordinating nomadic professional deployment across facilities, patient panels, and service types would reduce the administrative burden that currently deters nomadic practice.

| Platform Function | Capability | Benefit |
|-------------------|------------|---------|
| Facility coordination | Match professional availability with facility needs | Optimize coverage |
| Patient scheduling | Coordinate in-person and virtual visits | Continuity of care |
| Travel optimization | Route planning, logistics coordination | Minimize unproductive time |
| Documentation | Unified access to patient records | Information continuity |
| Communication | Secure messaging across sites | Care coordination |

Such platforms require **interoperability** with existing facility systems, which remains challenging. Health information exchange infrastructure, common data standards, and facility participation agreements would need to accompany platform development.

## Stakeholder Analysis

Building nomadic professional infrastructure affects interests differently than regulatory transformation. Some stakeholders benefit; others face disruption.

### Infrastructure Beneficiaries

| Stakeholder | Benefit from Nomadic Infrastructure |
|-------------|-------------------------------------|
| Rural communities | Access to professionals otherwise unavailable |
| Professionals seeking flexibility | Career option without permanent relocation |
| Healthcare systems | Sustainable staffing without locum premiums |
| Academic health centers | Extended regional reach for outreach programs |
| States facing workforce crisis | Additional tool for access improvement |

**Professionals seeking geographic flexibility** represent growing portion of healthcare workforce. Younger professionals increasingly resist permanent relocation to isolated communities, but many would consider rotating service arrangements with appropriate infrastructure support.

**Healthcare systems** currently pay substantial locum tenens premiums for temporary coverage. Nomadic infrastructure could provide stable coverage at lower cost than locum rates while offering better continuity than temporary assignments.

### Infrastructure Opposition

| Stakeholder | Concern About Nomadic Infrastructure |
|-------------|-------------------------------------|
| Locum tenens agencies | Competition with business model |
| State medical boards | Reduced regulatory authority and fee revenue |
| Hospitals seeking permanent staff | Alternative to desired employment model |
| Rural communities wanting resident physicians | Nomadic may seem second-best |

**Locum tenens agencies** have built businesses providing temporary staffing infrastructure. Purpose-built nomadic infrastructure could displace agency services for ongoing coverage arrangements, though agencies might adapt to serve nomadic professionals directly.

**State medical boards** derive authority and revenue from licensing. Automatic practice authority reduces both. Boards have historically resisted interstate compacts and would likely resist further compact enhancement.

**Some rural communities** strongly prefer resident physicians who become community members. Nomadic professionals may be perceived as less committed, less invested, and less available for emergencies. Community education about service equivalence would be necessary.

## Implementation Pathway

Building nomadic professional infrastructure requires coordinated effort across multiple organizations and funding sources over multiple years.

### Phase 1: Compact Enhancement (Years 1-3)

**Extend automatic practice authority** to all healthcare professional compacts. Federal legislation conditioning Medicare participation on compact membership would accelerate adoption. CMS and HRSA could prioritize compact states in discretionary grant programs.

| Action | Actor | Timeline |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Model legislation for automatic authority | National compact commissions | Year 1 |
| Federal participation incentives | Congress, CMS | Year 1-2 |
| State compact adoption | State legislatures | Years 1-3 |
| APRN compact development | Nursing organizations | Years 1-2 |
| PA compact implementation | PA organizations | Years 2-3 |

### Phase 2: Employment and Credentialing Infrastructure (Years 2-4)

**Create regional employment entities** and portable credentialing systems. State health departments could charter regional health employment authorities. Hospital associations could develop shared credentialing acceptance agreements.

| Action | Actor | Timeline |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Regional employment entity pilot | State health departments | Year 2 |
| Credentialing acceptance agreements | Hospital associations | Years 2-3 |
| Portable benefits design | Professional associations | Year 2 |
| Employment entity expansion | Multi-state regions | Years 3-4 |
| National credentialing standards | CMS, Joint Commission | Year 4 |

### Phase 3: Physical Infrastructure Development (Years 3-6)

**Develop housing networks** and service center facilities. USDA rural development programs could fund housing construction. State health facility financing could support service center development.

| Action | Actor | Timeline |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Housing network pilot | Regional health authority | Year 3 |
| Funding source identification | USDA, state agencies | Year 3 |
| Network expansion | Multi-region development | Years 4-5 |
| Service center integration | Housing plus clinical facilities | Years 5-6 |
| Reservation platform deployment | Technology development | Year 4 |

### Phase 4: Compensation and Community Systems (Years 4-6)

**Align payment models** with nomadic practice and develop professional community infrastructure. CMS could pilot capitated payment for nomadic professionals. Professional associations could host peer networks.

| Action | Actor | Timeline |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Value-based payment pilot | CMS, state Medicaid | Year 4 |
| Travel cost coverage standards | Payer negotiations | Year 4 |
| Peer network development | Professional associations | Years 4-5 |
| Mentorship program launch | Regional health organizations | Year 5 |
| Scheduling platform deployment | Technology development | Year 5 |

## Vignette: Dr. Okonkwo's Monthly Circuit

Dr. Amara Okonkwo, an internist specializing in diabetes and metabolic disease, leaves her apartment in Bozeman at 5:30 AM on the first Monday of October 2029. Her monthly circuit begins today.

She drives two hours to the Miles City Service Center, where she will spend two days seeing patients with complex diabetes who cannot be managed virtually. The housing unit waiting for her is a one-bedroom apartment maintained by the Northern Plains Health Network, the regional employment authority that has been her employer for three years. Fast fiber internet connects her to the network's electronic health record; the clinical space adjacent to her housing unit includes examination rooms and diabetes education facilities.

Amara sees 24 patients over two days. Most have been her patients for the full three years; she knows their families, their farming schedules, their barriers to medication adherence. Between in-person visits, she manages these patients virtually: monthly video visits, secure messaging, remote glucose monitoring that alerts her to patterns requiring intervention. But some things require hands: foot examinations for neuropathy, injection technique observation, the trust that builds when a physician takes your hand while explaining prognosis.

Wednesday evening she drives three hours east to the Glendive housing unit. Thursday and Friday follow the same pattern: complex patients who need in-person assessment, relationships maintained between visits through virtual care. Her panel in Glendive is smaller, about 60 patients compared to 90 in Miles City, but the needs are similar.

Saturday she drives south to the Billings housing unit for a weekend break before continuing her circuit. The Billings unit is in a cluster of professional apartments; four other nomadic professionals are there this weekend. They meet for dinner Saturday night: a psychiatrist who serves the same circuit, a nurse practitioner who covers primary care in the communities Amara does not reach, a physical therapist with her own rotation. This professional community, constructed deliberately by the Network, prevents the isolation that used to drive rural physicians away.

Monday through Tuesday: Sidney. Wednesday through Thursday: Wolf Point. Friday: back to Bozeman for a week of virtual visits, quality review, continuing education, and her own medical appointments before the circuit begins again.

Amara's compensation is capitated: she receives a per-member-per-month payment for each patient on her panel, with bonuses tied to diabetes control outcomes and preventive care completion. Her base pay slightly exceeds what she could earn in urban practice; the housing is provided by the Network at no cost; her travel expenses are reimbursed at federal rates.

She applied for this position after three years in Minneapolis hospitalist medicine left her burned out and disconnected. The Network recruiter explained the model: ongoing relationships with patients, predictable travel, professional community with other nomadic practitioners, and the clinical autonomy that comes from managing a defined panel rather than admitting whoever shows up.

Her patients could not have this care without the infrastructure. Before the Network developed the circuit model, Miles City's diabetes patients drove four hours to Billings for endocrinology, if they went at all. Most did not. Amputations and dialysis followed. Now Amara's Miles City panel has an average HbA1c of 7.2%, better than national benchmarks.

The infrastructure matters. Her multistate license, issued automatically through the enhanced Interstate Medical Licensure Compact, covers Montana, Wyoming, and the Dakotas. Her credentialing at all five service centers was handled by the Network through a regional agreement. Her housing is always ready, always connected, always professional quality. Her employer handles benefits, scheduling, and coordination.

Amara does not live in any of the communities she serves. But she has served them continuously for three years, and she knows she will serve them for years to come. That continuity, enabled by infrastructure that did not exist a decade ago, is what makes the care work.

## Conclusion

The nomadic professional model requires infrastructure that does not currently exist. Interstate licensure must evolve from expedited separate licenses to automatic practice authority. Credentialing must become portable across facilities. Housing networks must be built and maintained. Employment structures must support multi-community practice. Compensation models must align with panel outcomes rather than visit volume. Professional community must be deliberately constructed.

Building this infrastructure requires **coordinated investment** across federal agencies, state governments, regional health organizations, and professional associations. The investment is substantial: tens of millions of dollars for regional housing networks, years of policy development for compact enhancement, organizational innovation for employment structures.

But the alternative is continued failure of the permanent relocation model. Rural communities cannot recruit enough professionals willing to relocate permanently. The professionals who do relocate often leave within years. The workforce gap widens while communities age and health needs grow.

Nomadic professional infrastructure does not replace residential professionals who choose rural life. It supplements them with an alternative career model that can attract professionals who would never consider permanent relocation but might embrace periodic service. That expansion of the potential workforce pool is necessary to address rural healthcare crisis.
