## Which Rules Must Change and Who Decides

*Series 15: Enabling Conditions*

The alternative architecture described in Series 14 requires **regulatory flexibility that does not exist**. Every component, from inverse hub delivery to AI companions to service centers to local workforce pathways, runs into rules designed for a different healthcare system. These rules assume physicians as gatekeepers, hospitals as care anchors, physical presence as quality proxy, and volume as financial foundation.

Rural communities cannot transform within these constraints. The question is not whether rules should change but which rules, through what mechanisms, by whose authority, and in what sequence. This article inventories the **specific regulatory barriers** blocking alternative architecture, maps who has power to change them, analyzes stakeholder interests for and against change, and assesses realistic pathways to enabling conditions.

The barriers are not accidental. They emerged from legitimate concerns about patient safety, professional standards, and market competition. Some protect patients. Many protect incumbent providers. Distinguishing between the two is essential for transformation.

## The Barrier Inventory

Regulatory barriers to rural health transformation span four domains: scope of practice, facility licensing, technology authorization, and payment models. Each domain contains rules that made sense for urban healthcare markets but create impossible constraints for rural communities.

### Scope of Practice Barriers

**Scope of practice laws** determine which licensed professionals can perform which healthcare functions. These state laws vary dramatically, creating a patchwork that particularly harms rural areas where the relevant professionals may be available but legally constrained.

| Provider Type | Current Limitation | Rural Impact | Required Change |
|---------------|-------------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Nurse Practitioners | Physician supervision in approximately 22 states | Primary care unavailable in communities without physicians | Full practice authority in all states |
| Pharmacists | Cannot prescribe; limited chronic disease management | Pharmacy may be only healthcare professional in community | Prescriptive authority for specified conditions |
| Community Paramedics | Authorization limited to emergency transport in most states | Cannot provide primary care, treat and release, or manage chronic disease | Primary care and treat-in-place authorization |
| Community Health Workers | Cannot bill Medicare directly; limited Medicaid billing | Sustainable employment models unavailable | Direct Medicare and Medicaid billing pathways |
| Dental Therapists | Prohibited in over 40 states | Cannot address dental desert with mid-level provider | State authorization for dental therapy |
| Physical/Occupational Therapists | Physician referral required in many states | Delays access to rehabilitation services | Direct access authorization |

The **nurse practitioner full practice authority** map reveals the current landscape. As of early 2026, approximately **28 states and Washington D.C. grant full practice authority** to nurse practitioners, allowing independent practice without physician oversight. Five states joined this group in 2025 alone, including Michigan, Alabama, Louisiana, South Carolina, and Wisconsin, demonstrating continued momentum. Fifteen states maintain reduced practice authority requiring collaborative agreements. Approximately 11 states still require physician supervision throughout a nurse practitioner's career.

The evidence on outcomes is unambiguous. **Multiple studies show no significant difference** in patient outcomes between care provided by nurse practitioners with full authority and physician care, with some studies showing improvements in preventive care metrics and patient satisfaction. The National Academy of Medicine, American Association of Nurse Practitioners, and Federal Trade Commission have all recommended removing unnecessary scope barriers.

Yet physician organizations continue to oppose expansion, and **scope reform bills fail annually** in states like Texas, Georgia, Florida, and Pennsylvania. The American Medical Association's 2025 legislative summary documents at least a dozen nurse practitioner scope bills that remained active but stalled in legislatures. Opposition frames itself around patient safety while evidence suggests the actual driver is professional turf protection.

### Facility Licensing Barriers

**Facility licensing requirements** determine what configurations healthcare facilities must maintain. These requirements assume volume that rural communities cannot generate and staffing that rural facilities cannot recruit.

| Facility Type | Current Requirement | Barrier Effect | Required Change |
|---------------|---------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Hospital | Minimum service requirements, 24/7 emergency, inpatient capacity | Cannot right-size for rural volume | Micro-hospital or service center facility category |
| Primary Care Clinic | Physician presence requirements in many states | Cannot operate with telehealth as primary modality | Telehealth-primary facility category |
| Pharmacy | Licensed pharmacist on-site during all operating hours | Cannot serve low-volume areas economically | Remote supervision authorization |
| Clinical Laboratory | CLIA complexity requirements | Cannot deploy point-of-care testing broadly | Simplified rural laboratory pathway |
| Emergency Services | Full emergency department standards | Cannot sustain emergency access in low-volume areas | Scaled emergency service authorization |

The **Critical Access Hospital program** illustrates facility licensing tension. CAH designation requires 25 or fewer beds, 24/7 emergency services, and 96-hour average length of stay. These requirements made sense when designed in 1997 but prevent facilities from adapting to current conditions. A community that needs primary care, stabilization, and transfer capability but cannot sustain inpatient beds has no facility category available.

The Rural Emergency Hospital designation established in 2020 created a new option for hospitals willing to convert from inpatient services to emergency and outpatient only. But uptake has been limited, with fewer than 40 conversions by early 2026. The REH model still requires 24/7 emergency capability that some communities cannot staff.

**State Certificate of Need laws** add another barrier layer. Approximately 35 states require CON approval before healthcare facilities can be built, expanded, or add services. Designed to prevent oversupply and control costs, CON laws in rural areas may instead prevent new entrants in underserved markets. The evidence on CON effectiveness is mixed, with studies showing both cost control benefits and access restriction harms depending on market conditions and implementation.

### Technology Authorization Barriers

**Technology deployment** in healthcare faces regulatory uncertainty that creates liability exposure and prevents beneficial adoption. The technologies central to alternative architecture, including AI clinical decision support, AI companions, robot-assisted care, and remote monitoring, do not fit cleanly into existing regulatory categories.

| Technology | Current Status | Barrier Effect | Required Change |
|------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| AI clinical decision support | Unclear whether it constitutes practice of medicine | Providers hesitate to rely on AI recommendations | Safe harbor for compliant systems |
| AI triage and assessment | No established liability framework | Deployment hesitancy, insurance uncertainty | Defined liability allocation |
| AI companions for elderly | No regulatory category | Cannot deploy without legal risk | Privacy and safety framework |
| AI legal and financial services | Unauthorized practice concerns | Cannot deploy to address rural professional deserts | Safe harbor for defined AI services |
| Robotic care assistance | No healthcare robot standards | Cannot deploy in care settings | Robot function authorization |
| Remote patient monitoring | Reimbursement limitations, variable state rules | Cannot sustain programs financially | Payment reform and permanent telehealth parity |

State medical boards have not determined whether AI clinical decision support constitutes the practice of medicine. If AI providing diagnostic suggestions is practicing medicine, who is liable? The technology developer? The deploying facility? The clinician who follows or ignores the recommendation? **Liability insurers do not know how to price coverage** for AI-assisted care, creating premium uncertainty that deters adoption.

The FDA has approved over 500 AI medical devices, but regulatory approval for safety and efficacy does not resolve state-level practice of medicine questions. A device approved for radiology interpretation still requires a state determination about who can use it and with what oversight.

### Payment Barriers

**Payment models** determine financial viability. Current models assume fee-for-service volume that rural providers cannot generate, create barriers to innovative care delivery, and exclude providers central to alternative architecture.

| Payment Model | Current Limitation | Barrier Effect | Required Change |
|---------------|-------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Global budget | Complex CMS approval process, few demonstration slots | Rural providers cannot access population-based payment | Simplified rural global budget pathway |
| Community Health Worker billing | No Medicare direct billing; limited Medicaid pathways | CHW employment not financially sustainable | Direct Medicare CHW billing codes |
| Telehealth reimbursement | State variation, originating site restrictions, some pandemic flexibilities expiring | Telehealth not fully utilized | Permanent parity, any originating site |
| Value-based payment | Quality measures designed for volume populations | Rural providers excluded from value incentives | Rural-appropriate quality measures |
| Remote patient monitoring | Limited covered conditions, complex billing requirements | Cannot sustain comprehensive monitoring programs | Expanded RPM coverage |

The **telehealth parity** situation illustrates payment barrier dynamics. During the COVID-19 pandemic, CMS waived geographic and originating site restrictions, allowing Medicare beneficiaries to receive telehealth from home. These flexibilities made rural telehealth viable for the first time. Post-pandemic, Congress has extended flexibilities through temporary legislation, but **permanent telehealth reform has not passed**. Providers cannot make infrastructure investments when the payment rules might revert.

Medicare's **refusal to pay community health workers directly** undermines the local workforce model central to alternative architecture. CHWs can be funded through Medicaid managed care contracts, grant programs, or facility budgets, but Medicare fee-for-service provides no pathway. A 65-year-old Medicare beneficiary receiving CHW services represents cost to the employing facility with no offsetting revenue.

## State Variation Analysis

Regulatory environments cluster into recognizable patterns. Understanding these patterns helps identify which states might move first on enabling conditions and which will resist.

### Full Practice Authority Clustering

States with nurse practitioner full practice authority tend to share characteristics. Rural Western states like Montana, Wyoming, and North Dakota granted FPA decades ago out of practical necessity. More recently, northeastern states including Vermont, Maine, and New Hampshire have joined, often driven by primary care access concerns. Southern states remain concentrated in the restricted category, with Texas, Georgia, Florida, and North Carolina maintaining physician supervision requirements despite significant rural populations.

**States granting FPA since 2020** include Michigan (2025), Alabama (2025), Louisiana (2025), South Carolina (2025), Wisconsin (2025), Kentucky (2022), Kansas (2022), and several others adopting transition-to-practice models. The pattern suggests that **hospital closure crisis** may be the strongest predictor of state action. When communities lose healthcare access entirely, the political calculus shifts.

### Interstate Compact Participation

Interstate licensure compacts reveal state regulatory culture. The **Interstate Medical Licensure Compact** now includes 42 states plus Washington D.C. and Guam, with approximately 49,000 physicians actively participating and nearly 50,000 licenses issued through the expedited pathway. The **Nurse Licensure Compact** includes 43 jurisdictions, with 78% of U.S. nurses now eligible for multistate licenses.

Non-participating states for these major compacts include New York, California, Massachusetts (implementation pending), and Michigan (for IMLC). The holdouts tend to be large states with self-sufficient healthcare labor markets and strong professional association influence. **California and New York combined represent approximately 20% of the U.S. population** excluded from physician compact benefits.

### Factors Predicting State Action

Analysis of recent scope and licensing reforms suggests several predictive factors:

**Hospital closure crisis** appears most powerful. When communities lose their hospitals and emergency access, constituent pressure on legislators intensifies. Lawmakers who previously deferred to physician organizations may reconsider when the choice becomes nurse practitioners or nothing.

**Governor leadership** matters significantly. Governors who make rural health a priority can move agencies, convene stakeholders, and set legislative agendas. Pennsylvania's implementation of three licensure compacts in 2025 followed sustained gubernatorial focus.

**Workforce shortage severity** creates conditions for change. States experiencing dramatic vacancy rates in rural facilities face pressure to expand who can fill positions.

**Political control** shows mixed effects. Red states have recently led FPA expansion (Alabama, Louisiana, South Carolina) despite traditional deference to physician organizations. The framing of FPA as "deregulation" and "free market" aligns with conservative values.

## Federal vs. State Authority

Understanding which changes require federal action versus state action is essential for strategy. Many advocates waste effort lobbying the wrong level of government.

### Only Federal Government Can Change

**Medicare payment policy** is exclusively federal. CMS determines coverage, reimbursement rates, billing codes, and participation requirements for Medicare fee-for-service. Congressional action is required to create new payment pathways like direct CHW billing. CMS administrative action can expand covered services or modify payment amounts within statutory authority.

**Interstate commerce** in healthcare falls under federal authority. National standards for AI medical devices, interstate telehealth services, and cross-border practice ultimately require federal frameworks or congressional authorization of interstate compacts.

**Drug Enforcement Administration** scheduling and prescriptive authority for controlled substances is federal, though implemented through state licensing.

### Only States Can Change

**Professional licensure** is a state function. Scope of practice for physicians, nurses, pharmacists, therapists, and other professionals is determined by state legislatures and licensing boards. No federal action can grant nurse practitioners full practice authority in Texas.

**Facility licensing** is state regulated. Hospital, clinic, pharmacy, and laboratory licensing requirements are established under state law. CMS conditions of participation overlay federal requirements but do not preempt state licensing.

**Corporate practice of medicine** restrictions vary by state. Many states prohibit non-physician ownership of medical practices, affecting potential governance models for alternative architecture. State action is required to modify these restrictions.

### Requires Federal-State Coordination

**Medicaid** operates as federal-state partnership. Coverage decisions, payment rates, and waiver authorities require both federal approval and state implementation. Medicaid CHW billing requires state plan amendments approved by CMS.

**Telehealth** involves both levels. Medicare telehealth policy is federal, but state laws on telehealth-specific practice, out-of-state providers, and prescribing add additional requirements.

**Interstate compacts** require state legislative adoption of federally authorized frameworks. Compacts enable but do not require state participation.

## Stakeholder Analysis

Regulatory change creates winners and losers. Understanding stakeholder interests honestly, including opposition, is essential for coalition building and opposition management.

### Who Benefits from Current Arrangements

| Stakeholder | Protected Interest | Position on Change |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Physician organizations (AMA, state medical societies) | Income, authority, professional identity | Generally oppose scope expansion |
| Hospital systems | Market protection, service revenue | Mixed; some benefit from regulatory flexibility |
| Medical specialty societies | Referral patterns, procedural revenue | Oppose non-physician performance of procedures |
| Professional schools | Enrollment dependent on credential value | Resist credential dilution |
| Staffing companies | Revenue from shortage-driven demand | Business model depends on vacancy rates |
| Liability insurers | Defined risk categories | Resist coverage uncertainty |

The **American Medical Association** has consistently opposed nurse practitioner scope expansion, framing opposition around patient safety and training disparities. The AMA's 2025 scope of practice summary documents active opposition to scope bills across multiple states, with particular focus on blocking CRNA independent practice and NP prescriptive authority.

State medical societies often exceed national AMA intensity in opposing local scope reforms. Texas Medical Association, Georgia Medical Association, and Florida Medical Association have lobbied successfully against repeated FPA attempts.

### Who Would Benefit from Change

| Stakeholder | Potential Gain | Current Activity |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Nursing organizations (AANP, ANA, state associations) | Expanded scope, professional recognition, practice ownership | Active advocacy for FPA |
| Rural health associations | Increased access, workforce flexibility | Support but limited political power |
| AARP | Member access to care | Increasingly vocal support for FPA |
| Technology companies | Market access, reduced liability uncertainty | Emerging advocacy |
| Consumer organizations | Choice, access, cost | Generally supportive when engaged |
| State budget offices | Reduced Medicaid costs from increased access | Potential ally if fiscally framed |

**Nursing organizations** have achieved significant wins through sustained advocacy. The American Association of Nurse Practitioners has made FPA state legislation a top priority, providing model legislation, grassroots support, and economic impact studies.

**AARP's endorsement** of scope expansion has shifted political dynamics. With 38 million members concentrated among voters who need healthcare access, AARP support provides political cover for legislators to vote against physician organizations.

### Who Actively Opposes Change and Why

The physician organizations opposing scope expansion frame objections around **training differentials**. Physicians complete approximately four years of medical school plus three to seven years of residency. Nurse practitioners complete approximately two to four years of graduate nursing education with varying clinical hours. This training differential is real.

However, training arguments obscure several realities. First, most scope expansion addresses primary care, where evidence shows equivalent outcomes between NPs and physicians. Second, the comparison in rural areas is not between NP care and physician care but between NP care and no care. Third, training hours for some specialties (community paramedicine, dental therapy) are specifically designed for the scope being authorized.

**Economic interests** drive much opposition. Physicians in collaborative agreement states receive income from supervising NPs. FPA eliminates this revenue stream. Physician practice owners face competition from NP-owned practices. Hospital-employed physicians lose patient referrals when NPs can practice independently.

**Professional identity** compounds economic concerns. Medicine has historically positioned the physician as healthcare team leader. FPA challenges this hierarchy. Some physician opposition reflects genuine concern about professional status rather than patient safety or economics.

## Implementation Pathways

Given barrier inventories, stakeholder positions, and authority mapping, what implementation pathways might achieve enabling conditions?

### State-Level Strategy

**Crisis-driven states** offer the most promising near-term opportunities. States experiencing acute hospital closure cascades, severe workforce shortages, or public health emergencies face political conditions that favor reform. Legislators who defended the status quo may reconsider when constituents lack access to any care.

**Model legislation** prepared by nursing organizations, rural health associations, and policy research groups reduces barriers to legislative action. Legislators can introduce pre-drafted bills with supporting economic analysis and outcome evidence.

**Coalition building** that combines nursing organizations, rural health advocates, consumer groups like AARP, and business organizations can outweigh physician organization opposition. The National Governors Association has endorsed scope expansion, providing bipartisan gubernatorial cover.

**Messaging matters**. Framing scope expansion as "patient access" rather than "nurse autonomy" shifts political dynamics. Emphasizing rural emergency rather than professional competition focuses attention on the problem being solved.

### Federal Strategy

**Medicare payment reform** through congressional action remains necessary for several enabling conditions. Direct CHW Medicare billing, permanent telehealth parity, and simplified rural global budget pathways require legislation. Administrative action can expand some covered services but cannot create new provider types or fundamentally reform payment models.

**Innovation Center demonstrations** provide pathways for testing alternative models before broader policy change. CMS Innovation Center authority allows testing of payment and delivery innovations with potential scale-up if successful. The Pennsylvania Rural Health Model and other demonstrations create evidence that can support future legislation.

**Regulatory clarity** on AI and technology governance could come through administrative action. FDA, HHS, and relevant agencies could establish frameworks for AI clinical decision support, liability allocation, and safety standards without congressional action for many applications.

### Compact Strategy

**Interstate compact expansion** is achievable through state-by-state adoption. With 42 states in the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact and 43 in the Nurse Licensure Compact, momentum supports continued expansion. Targeting remaining large states (California, New York for various compacts) would significantly expand coverage.

The **APRN Compact** for advanced practice registered nurses remains in early stages, with limited state adoption. Accelerating APRN Compact participation would extend multistate license benefits to the nurse practitioners most critical for rural primary care.

New compacts for **non-clinical professions** serving rural communities, including attorneys, financial advisors, and social workers, do not exist but could be developed. The professional licensing compact model has proven viable; extending it requires professional organization and state interest.

## Vignette: When the Rules Finally Changed

*Mississippi, January 2029*

Dr. Tamara Washington still remembers the day she learned nurse practitioners could finally practice independently in Mississippi. She had spent 12 years working under collaborative agreements, driving 45 minutes each week to meet with her supervising physician in Greenville, paying him $3,500 monthly for a signature he provided in 20 minutes. Her patients in Sunflower County never saw him. He never saw them.

**The 2027 legislative session changed everything.** After the seventh hospital closure in the Delta since 2020, after AARP ran television ads showing elderly patients with no place to go, after the Mississippi Hospital Association quietly withdrew opposition, the scope expansion bill passed with bipartisan support. Governor Tate Reeves, a Republican who had previously sided with physician organizations, signed it citing "rural emergency."

Washington opened her own practice that July. No more supervision payments. No more wasted drive time. She hired two community health workers and a medical assistant, converting the supervision savings to staffing. Her panel grew from 800 patients to 1,400 within 18 months. Some came from the closed hospital's former primary care patients. Others were people who had never had a regular provider.

**The transition was not seamless.** The state medical association filed suit challenging the law, delaying full implementation by eight months before the case was dismissed. The first medical liability insurer refused to cover independent NP practices, forcing Washington to find specialty coverage at higher rates until the market adjusted. Some physicians referred to her as "that nurse playing doctor" at the regional medical society meetings she attended.

But her outcomes data told a different story. Her diabetic patients had better A1C control than the state average. Her hypertensive patients had better blood pressure control. Her patient satisfaction scores exceeded the regional average. When the state health department published comparative quality data two years after FPA implementation, the "training differential" argument became harder to sustain.

Washington now precepts NP students from the University of Mississippi Medical Center, showing them that independent rural practice is possible. **Three of her former students have opened practices in other Delta counties**, filling gaps the hospital closures left behind. None of them required a physician supervisor. All of them required rules that finally matched rural reality.

## Conclusion

Regulatory transformation is not optional for alternative architecture. The rules governing scope of practice, facility licensing, technology authorization, and payment models must change for any Series 14 component to become reality. Some changes require state action. Some require federal action. Many require sustained effort against organized opposition.

The barriers are political, not technical. Evidence supports scope expansion. Precedent exists for facility flexibility. Technology governance frameworks can be developed. Payment reform is achievable. The question is not whether enabling conditions are possible but whether coalitions can form, pressure can mount, and timing can align.

**The stakes are measured in access**. Every year that scope restrictions remain in states like Texas, Georgia, and Florida is another year that rural communities lack primary care. Every year without direct CHW Medicare billing is another year that sustainable local workforce employment remains impossible. Every year without technology governance frameworks is another year that beneficial AI cannot deploy at scale.

Tribal nations can bypass state regulations through sovereignty, demonstrating what works while states debate. Series 14's tribal demonstration model creates evidence that strengthens the case for broader change. But most rural communities cannot wait for tribal demonstration effects to shift state politics.

The transformation question is ultimately political. Who has power? Who will exercise it? Under what conditions will those who benefit from current arrangements accept change? The answers vary by state, by moment, by the intensity of crisis. This article maps the terrain. Navigating it requires political strategy that subsequent Series 15 articles address.
