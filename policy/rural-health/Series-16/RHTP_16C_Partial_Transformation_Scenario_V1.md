# RHTP 16.C
# The Partial Transformation Scenario
## What Happens When Some States Transform and Others Do Not

## Introduction

The transformation scenario imagines what success looks like everywhere. The managed decline scenario imagines what failure looks like everywhere. Neither is likely. **The most probable future is divergence**: some states pursue alternative architecture aggressively, others make partial progress, and still others continue on current trajectories with minimal structural change.

This scenario matters because divergence creates dynamics that neither uniform success nor uniform failure would produce. **Migration patterns shift.** Border communities face service fragmentation. Political pressures intensify in some directions and relax in others. Federal policy confronts questions about whether to support leaders, compel laggards, or accept permanent geographic inequality in healthcare access.

The partial transformation scenario draws on evidence already visible in American healthcare. The Medicaid expansion divide created a natural experiment in state-level health policy divergence. By early 2025, **41 states had adopted Medicaid expansion while 10 had not**, producing measurable differences in coverage, access, hospital financial viability, and health outcomes. The coverage gap affects approximately **1.4 million people** concentrated in Southern states that declined expansion. Hospitals in expansion states are roughly **84 percent less likely to close** than those in non-expansion states. This existing divergence provides the clearest preview of what partial transformation produces: not a single national trajectory but **two Americas with widening distance between them**.

The scenario that follows is not prediction. It is structured analysis of what divergence would look like if applied not just to coverage decisions but to comprehensive health system transformation, and what that divergence would mean for the 46 million Americans living in rural communities.

## Scenario Assumptions

This scenario assumes the following conditions by 2030:

**Transformation cluster (10 to 12 states)** achieve substantial implementation of alternative architecture. These states establish sovereign investment mechanisms, implement regulatory reform enabling service centers and expanded practice authority, deploy AI companion technology at meaningful scale, and build local workforce pipelines. They do not achieve everything Series 14 envisions, but they achieve enough to alter trajectory.

**Partial progress cluster (15 to 20 states)** implement some components of alternative architecture without completing the system. They may expand telehealth infrastructure and deploy community health workers but fail to establish sovereign funds or pursue regulatory transformation. They improve outcomes modestly without fundamentally changing the delivery model.

**Minimal change cluster (15 to 20 states)** continue current trajectories. RHTP funding produces incremental improvements during the grant period, but no structural transformation occurs. When federal funding sunsets, most improvements prove unsustainable. These states experience the managed decline dynamics described in RHTP 16.D.

**Federal policy** supports but does not require transformation. Innovation Zone authority passes but participation remains voluntary. Interstate compacts expand but do not achieve comprehensive coverage. **No federal mandate compels states to transform.**

## State Clustering

Which states land in which cluster is not random. It reflects **existing capacity, political alignment, crisis severity, and leadership quality** in combinations that are partially predictable.

**Transformation leaders** share several characteristics: acute rural health crisis creating political urgency, existing institutional capacity for complex implementation, political leadership willing to pursue regulatory reform, and revenue sources available for sovereign investment. States with strong rural health associations, experienced state offices of rural health, and traditions of health policy innovation start with advantages. Illustrative candidates include states in the **Upper Midwest** (Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa) with cooperative traditions and institutional capacity, **Northern New England** (Vermont, Maine) with small scale enabling coordination, and individual states where political leadership aligns with implementation capacity.

**Partial progress states** typically have one or two enabling factors but lack others. They may face acute crisis but lack institutional capacity. They may have capacity but lack political will for regulatory reform. They may implement technology components while failing to address workforce or governance. **Most states land here**, producing improvement that falls short of transformation.

**Minimal change states** face political barriers that prevent structural reform regardless of crisis severity. States where healthcare industry opposition dominates legislative process, where ideological resistance to government-led transformation outweighs pragmatic crisis response, or where implementation capacity is too thin to execute complex programs remain on current trajectory. Some of these states contain the nation's most severe rural health challenges.

The cruelest feature of this clustering is that **states with the greatest need are not necessarily states with the greatest capacity to transform**. Mississippi, with 49% of rural hospitals vulnerable to closure and among the worst rural health outcomes nationally, faces implementation capacity constraints that states with less severe challenges do not. Texas, with 47 vulnerable rural hospitals, has the scale penalty that makes per-capita RHTP investment vanishingly thin. **Need and capacity are inversely correlated in the states where transformation matters most.**

## Timeline Projection

| Period | Key Developments |
|--------|------------------|
| **2026 to 2028** | Divergence begins. Early adopter states use RHTP flexibility to pilot service center models, launch sovereign fund legislation, pursue regulatory reform. Other states implement conventional RHTP strategies. Gap not yet visible in outcomes data. |
| **2028 to 2030** | Gap becomes measurable. Transformation states show stabilizing provider counts, improving access metrics, declining hospital closure rates. Non-transformation states continue baseline deterioration. Migration patterns begin: providers and health-sensitive populations shift toward transformation states. |
| **2030 to 2032** | Political pressure intensifies. Success in transformation states creates demonstration effect. Neighboring non-transformation states face constituent pressure. Some states shift from minimal change to partial progress. Others resist, framing divergence as "state choice." Federal debate over equity intervention begins. |
| **2032 to 2035** | Stabilization at divergent equilibrium. Transformation states achieve mature alternative architecture. Non-transformation states settle into managed decline with adapted expectations. Federal intervention remains politically contentious. The gap widens but becomes normalized. |

## Divergence Effects

The consequences of partial transformation extend beyond simple variation in healthcare access. Divergence creates **dynamic effects** that reshape rural communities, workforce patterns, economic development, and political landscapes.

**Healthcare access divergence** is the most direct effect. By 2035 under this scenario, residents of transformation states have access to primary care within 30 minutes at rates approaching 80%, behavioral health access improving toward 60%, and dental services reaching 55%. Residents of non-transformation states see primary care access declining toward 50%, behavioral health access falling below 25%, and dental access dropping toward 20%. **The same rural American, born 30 miles apart in different states, faces fundamentally different healthcare futures.**

**Workforce redistribution** accelerates divergence. Providers already concentrate where practice conditions are sustainable. Transformation states offering local career workforce models, AI-augmented practice support, and functional referral networks through inverse hub architecture become more attractive. Non-transformation states with deteriorating infrastructure, unsupported solo practice, and closing facilities lose providers faster. This creates a **self-reinforcing cycle**: states with better systems attract more providers, further improving systems, while states losing providers see further system degradation.

**Economic vitality effects** compound beyond healthcare. Rural communities with functioning health systems can attract employers whose workers need healthcare access. Communities without healthcare cannot recruit young families, cannot retain retirees whose healthcare needs increase, and cannot attract businesses that evaluate workforce healthcare availability. **Healthcare transformation becomes economic development infrastructure**; healthcare decline becomes economic development barrier.

**Technology investment patterns** follow transformation. Technology companies deploying AI companion platforms, telehealth infrastructure, and digital coordination systems invest where regulatory environments support deployment and patient populations reach viable scale. Transformation states attract technology investment that improves service delivery. Non-transformation states remain in analog care delivery while transformation states build digital infrastructure.

## Migration and Sorting

Perhaps the most consequential dynamic in partial transformation is **population sorting**. When healthcare availability differs systematically across state lines, people with the means and motivation to move do so.

**Health-sensitive populations migrate first.** Families with children requiring specialty care, elderly residents needing reliable primary care access, individuals with chronic conditions requiring ongoing management, and pregnant women seeking obstetric services all face powerful incentives to locate in transformation states. This sorting is not theoretical: research on Medicaid expansion showed **measurable migration effects** as individuals relocated to states with better coverage availability.

**Provider migration follows.** Physicians, nurse practitioners, and behavioral health professionals already concentrate in states with better practice conditions. When transformation states offer structured career pathways, AI-augmented practice support, and sustainable workloads while non-transformation states offer deteriorating infrastructure and unsupported practice, the workforce advantage compounds. Rural provider recruitment, already the defining challenge of rural healthcare, becomes functionally impossible in non-transformation states.

**The sorting problem creates demographic acceleration.** As health-sensitive, higher-income, and working-age populations relocate, non-transformation states lose tax revenue, community capacity, and political constituencies for change. **Remaining populations are older, sicker, poorer, and less politically powerful.** The communities with the greatest need have the least capacity to demand transformation.

This dynamic is visible in existing rural America. Communities that lost hospitals saw population decline accelerate. Counties with declining healthcare infrastructure experience out-migration rates higher than counties with stable infrastructure. The partial transformation scenario projects this existing dynamic across state boundaries at scale.

## Border Community Challenges

Divergence creates particular challenges for communities near state borders. An estimated **15 to 20 percent of rural Americans** live within reasonable travel distance of a state boundary, making interstate differences immediately tangible.

Consider a community straddling the border between a transformation state and a non-transformation state. Residents on the transformation side access a service center 15 minutes away, with AI companion monitoring for elderly family members, CHW support for chronic disease management, and virtual specialty access through the inverse hub. Residents on the non-transformation side face a 60-minute drive to the nearest primary care provider, no behavioral health access within their county, and emergency services strained by declining coverage.

**Interstate licensure barriers** prevent easy solutions. A nurse practitioner employed by the transformation state's service center cannot simply extend services across the state line. A CHW trained and credentialed in the transformation state may lack recognition in the neighboring state. AI companion platforms approved for deployment in one state may face regulatory uncertainty in the adjacent state.

**Cross-border care-seeking** creates friction. Residents of non-transformation states traveling to transformation state facilities increase demand on systems sized for their own populations. Transformation states face political pressure to serve their own residents first. Non-transformation state politicians may frame cross-border care-seeking as evidence that their residents are being served, reducing urgency for their own transformation.

The interstate compact expansion assumed in this scenario provides partial relief but does not resolve the fundamental divergence. **Coordination mechanisms enable professionals to practice across lines.** They do not create the infrastructure, governance, or funding that transformation requires on both sides.

## Vignette 1: Border Community

*Whitesburg, Kentucky sits twelve miles from the Virginia border. In 2032, the distance is measured in decades.*

Virginia moved early. A coalition of rural legislators from the Shenandoah Valley and Southwest convinced the General Assembly that rural health collapse threatened military recruitment from communities that traditionally supplied a disproportionate share of enlistees. The framing worked where healthcare arguments alone had not. By 2029, Virginia established its Rural Health Investment Authority, funded initially through sports betting revenue. Service centers opened in Lee County, Wise County, and Scott County. The University of Virginia's inverse hub provides virtual specialty access throughout Southwest Virginia. AI companions serve 12,000 elderly residents across the coalfield communities.

Kentucky did not move. The state's RHTP implementation followed conventional strategies: telehealth expansion, workforce recruitment incentives, care coordination pilots. When RHTP funding sunsets in 2030 without reauthorization, most improvements dissolve. Whitesburg's hospital, already fragile, reduces services further. The last psychiatrist within 90 minutes retires.

**Brenda Caudill notices the difference every day.** Her mother lives in Whitesburg. Her sister moved to Norton, Virginia, seven years ago. Brenda's mother manages diabetes, hypertension, and early-stage kidney disease with a primary care nurse practitioner who sees 35 patients daily and cannot meaningfully coordinate complex care. Her sister's mother-in-law, the same age with similar conditions, has a CHW who visits weekly, AI companion monitoring that alerts the care team to blood sugar trends, and virtual nephrology consultation through UVA.

Brenda considered moving to Virginia. But her mother cannot move: the house, the church, the cemetery where her father and grandparents rest. Her mother's Social Security and pension buy more in Letcher County than Lee County. The family owns land in Kentucky that has no market value but immeasurable personal value.

So Brenda drives her mother to Norton for specialist appointments, crossing into a different healthcare reality twelve miles from home. The Norton service center staff know Brenda by name. They process the out-of-state insurance with practiced efficiency; she is not the only Kentuckian making this drive. The service center's waiting room on Tuesday mornings is an informal survey of Letcher County's aging population.

The political dynamics are toxic. Kentucky legislators point to Norton as evidence that "the market" provides. Virginia legislators resent Kentucky's failure creating demand they did not plan for. A bill to restrict non-Virginia residents' access to Virginia service centers fails, but the debate poisons cross-border relationships that communities had maintained for generations.

**Twelve miles. Two states. Two futures.** Brenda's mother and her sister's mother-in-law share Appalachian heritage, coal country identity, and the chronic diseases that coalfield living produces. They differ in which side of an invisible line they call home.

## Vignette 2: Federal Policymaker

*Dr. Sarah Okonkwo reviews the quarterly Rural Health Transformation Scorecard from her office at CMS. The map tells two stories.*

Green states cluster in the Upper Midwest, Northern New England, and scattered across the Mountain West. These are states where alternative architecture is taking root: service centers operational, sovereign funds capitalized, workforce pipelines producing CHWs and digital health workers. Access metrics are improving. Hospital closure rates are declining. Behavioral health access, the most stubborn metric, shows the first sustained gains in a decade.

Red states stretch across the Deep South, parts of the Plains, and states where political opposition to "government transformation" proved insurmountable. Access continues declining. Hospital closures accelerate. The 2030 RHTP sunset removed the floor that had prevented freefall.

**The yellow states trouble Dr. Okonkwo most.** These are partial progress states that implemented some components but not enough. They deployed telehealth and CHWs but did not pursue regulatory reform or establish sovereign funds. Improvement occurred during RHTP funding. Without structural change, improvement is eroding. These states face a choice: complete the transformation or watch partial gains evaporate.

Dr. Okonkwo's briefing for the Secretary presents three options. The first: **reward transformation states** with additional federal investment, accelerating their success as demonstration for others. This is efficient but widens the gap. The second: **target lagging states** with additional support and technical assistance, attempting to pull them toward transformation. This faces political resistance from states that view federal support as federal control. The third: **mandate minimum transformation standards** as condition for federal healthcare funding. This is the most equitable and the most politically impossible.

The Secretary asks the question Dr. Okonkwo has been avoiding: "At what point does geographic inequality in healthcare access become a federal civil rights issue?"

She does not have an answer. The Medicaid expansion precedent suggests the federal government will accept permanent state-level divergence in healthcare access. The political system has tolerated 1.4 million people in the coverage gap for over a decade. It may tolerate divergent health systems indefinitely.

**Dr. Okonkwo drafts a recommendation for the hybrid approach**: reward leaders, support willing states, and document the gap with enough precision that future political conditions might support intervention. It is the pragmatic option. It accepts that some rural Americans will live in transformation states and others will not, and that the difference will be measured in years of life expectancy, preventable deaths, and avoidable suffering.

She sends the briefing. She does not feel good about it.

## Political Dynamics

Partial transformation generates political dynamics that are distinct from uniform scenarios and potentially self-reinforcing.

**Success creates demonstration pressure.** When transformation states show measurable improvement in access, outcomes, and economic vitality, neighboring states face constituent pressure to follow. Rural residents in non-transformation states who observe better outcomes across the border become advocates for change. This dynamic has precedent: Medicaid expansion spread gradually as evidence accumulated, with South Dakota and North Carolina adopting expansion years after initial holdouts.

**But success also enables federalism arguments.** Politicians in non-transformation states can frame divergence as "letting states decide" rather than federal failure. The same argument that prevented Medicaid expansion in 10 states despite overwhelming evidence of benefit could prevent transformation adoption. **Ideological commitment to state autonomy outweighs empirical evidence of superior outcomes in some political environments.**

**Divergence may become self-reinforcing.** As transformation states attract providers, technology investment, and health-sensitive populations, their capacity for further improvement grows. As non-transformation states lose these resources, their capacity for eventual transformation diminishes. **The window for change narrows as divergence persists.** States that do not transform within the first decade may find transformation increasingly difficult as human and financial capital has relocated.

**The federal role becomes the central political question.** American federalism permits substantial variation in state policy. It also creates tension when that variation produces dramatically unequal access to fundamental services. The federal government's response to partial transformation reveals its values: **whether geographic equity in healthcare access is a right or merely a preference.**

The most likely federal response, based on precedent, is documentation and encouragement without compulsion. The federal government documented Medicaid expansion's benefits for a decade without requiring holdout states to adopt it. Similar dynamics would likely characterize partial health transformation. **Federal reports would quantify the gap while federal policy would accept it.**

## Regional Variation Within the Partial Transformation Scenario

Divergence does not follow state boundaries exclusively. **Within-state variation** means that even transformation states contain communities that lag, and even non-transformation states contain communities that innovate.

**Tribal nations** represent a distinct pathway. Sovereign authority enables tribal health enterprises to implement alternative architecture regardless of state-level decisions. The tribal demonstration projects envisioned in RHTP 14.G could proceed in non-transformation states, creating islands of innovation within managed decline. This produces its own tensions: tribal communities accessing AI companions and service center models while surrounding non-tribal communities lack basic primary care.

**University-anchored communities** in non-transformation states may achieve partial transformation through institutional resources. Academic medical centers extending virtual services, university-based CHW training programs, and research-funded technology pilots create localized improvement that does not extend to communities beyond institutional reach.

**Appalachian communities** spanning 13 states would experience the full range of divergence effects. Virginia's transformation would contrast with Kentucky's stagnation. West Virginia's choices would differ from Pennsylvania's. **The region that most needs coordinated response would experience the most fragmented one.**

**Delta communities** in Mississippi, Arkansas, and Louisiana face similar multi-state fragmentation. If Arkansas transforms while Mississippi does not, Delta communities separated by the river face the same border dynamics described above, compounded by the region's existing infrastructure deficits and persistent poverty.

## Implications for Stakeholders

**For state agencies**: Partial transformation creates pressure to choose. States in the partial progress cluster face the clearest decision: complete transformation or accept that partial investment yields partial, potentially temporary, results. The evidence from early transformation states provides both roadmap and urgency.

**For providers**: The partial transformation scenario accelerates existing workforce concentration patterns. Providers in non-transformation states face escalating unsustainability. Those willing to relocate will find opportunities in transformation states hungry for workforce. Those unwilling or unable to relocate face increasingly difficult practice conditions.

**For community organizations**: Communities in non-transformation states gain importance as the primary remaining infrastructure for health support. Faith organizations, mutual aid networks, and volunteer care coordination become essential when formal systems fail. The community action guidance in RHTP 16.F becomes most urgent for these communities.

**For technology companies**: Partial transformation creates a bifurcated market. Transformation states offer viable deployment environments for AI companions, digital health platforms, and telehealth infrastructure. Non-transformation states offer limited market opportunity. This concentration of technology investment further widens divergence.

**For federal policymakers**: Partial transformation forces a reckoning with geographic equity. The federal government must decide whether to accept permanent divergence in rural healthcare access or pursue mechanisms, whether incentives, mandates, or direct federal provision, to establish minimum standards that state boundaries cannot eliminate.

## Conclusion

The partial transformation scenario is arguably the most likely future because it requires no assumption that all states will act wisely or that all states will fail. It requires only the historically validated assumption that **American states respond differently to identical challenges based on political alignment, institutional capacity, and leadership quality**.

The scenario reveals that partial transformation may be worse than uniform scenarios for the communities left behind. Under managed decline, there is at least grim equality: everyone's healthcare deteriorates together. Under partial transformation, **deterioration in non-transformation states is accelerated by the success of transformation states**, which pull workforce, investment, and population away from communities that cannot compete.

The central policy question is whether the federal government accepts this divergence or intervenes to prevent it. American precedent, particularly a decade of accepted Medicaid expansion divergence, suggests acceptance is the default. But the scale of divergence envisioned here, where rural residents of some states access AI-augmented, CHW-supported, service center-delivered care while rural residents of other states lack basic primary care, may eventually exceed the tolerance of a democratic society that claims to value equal opportunity regardless of geography.

The partial transformation scenario is not optimistic or pessimistic. It is **realistic about what happens when some succeed and others fail in a federal system that permits both**. Whether this realism is cause for hope or despair depends on where you live.
