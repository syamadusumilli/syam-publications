## Comprehensive Epidemiological Reference

This technical document provides the **data foundation** for Series 11 articles and cross-referencing throughout the Rural Health Transformation Project. Tables compile mortality, morbidity, and access metrics by region and condition, enabling articles to interpret patterns selectively rather than replicate comprehensive datasets.

**Data sources**: CDC WONDER, BRFSS, HRSA Area Health Resource Files, National Vital Statistics System, state vital statistics, and peer-reviewed epidemiological literature.

**Regional definitions**: National Rural (nonmetropolitan counties per OMB classification), Delta (252 counties across eight states along Mississippi River), Appalachia (423 counties across 13 states per ARC designation), Great Plains (agricultural regions from North Dakota through Kansas), Frontier West (counties with fewer than 6 persons per square mile), New England Rural (nonmetropolitan portions of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont), and Tribal Areas (federally recognized reservations and trust lands).

# Section 1: Mortality Data

## 1.1 All-Cause Mortality

| Region | Age-Adjusted Rate (per 100,000) | Comparison to National Urban | Year |
|--------|--------------------------------|------------------------------|------|
| **National Rural** | 834.0 | +20% | 2019 |
| **Delta** | 1,000+ | +42% | 2019 |
| **Appalachia** | 890.0 | +26% | 2019 |
| **Great Plains** | 780.0 | +11% | 2019 |
| **Frontier West** | 810.0 | +15% | 2019 |
| **New England Rural** | 740.0 | +5% | 2019 |
| **Tribal Areas** | 1,050.0 | +50% | 2019 |

**Key patterns**: The **rural mortality penalty** widened from 7% in 1999 to 20% by 2019. Delta and Tribal regions carry the highest burden, with mortality rates exceeding urban rates by more than 40%. **New England rural** represents a notable exception, where mortality approaches urban levels despite geographic barriers.
