# Technical Document 1-TD-C
## Regional Variation Matrix

*Series 1: Understanding Rural and Deep Rural America*

---

## Purpose

National rural statistics obscure **dramatic regional variation**. A county in rural Vermont shares little with a county in the Mississippi Delta beyond federal classification. Policy designed for "rural America" as monolith fails communities whose challenges differ fundamentally.

This reference document provides **systematic comparison across seven primary rural regions** on five dimensions:

1. Demographics
2. Economics
3. Healthcare infrastructure
4. Social infrastructure
5. Health outcomes

The matrix establishes **baseline regional profiles** supporting Series 10 (Regional Deep Dives) and enabling region-appropriate policy analysis throughout the project.

## Part I: Regional Definitions

### Seven Primary Rural Regions

| Region | Geographic Scope | Defining Characteristics |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| **Appalachia** | 423 counties across 13 states from NY to MS | Mountain geography, extraction economy legacy, cultural distinctiveness |
| **Delta** | MS, AR, LA river counties plus adjacent areas | Plantation legacy, persistent poverty, majority-minority demographics |
| **Black Belt South** | AL, GA, SC, NC crescent of historically high Black population | Agricultural legacy, out-migration, institutional disinvestment |
| **Great Plains** | TX Panhandle through Dakotas | Agricultural consolidation, extreme depopulation, vast distances |
| **Rural West** | Mountain and intermountain states excluding Pacific coast metros | Federal land dominance, tribal nations, amenity migration |
| **Upper Midwest** | WI, MN, MI, northern IL, IN, OH rural | Dairy, manufacturing decline, aging Scandinavian/German heritage |
| **New England Rural** | ME, NH, VT, western MA, CT, RI rural | Small towns, tourism dependency, aging population, high costs |

### Regional Overlap

Regions are **analytical constructs**, not exclusive categories. Key overlaps:

- **Appalachia and Rural South** share counties in TN, KY, NC, VA, WV
- **Delta and Black Belt** share persistent poverty characteristics
- **Great Plains and Rural West** share distance and federal land presence
- **Upper Midwest and Appalachia** share post-industrial transition in OH, PA

---

## Part VII: Regional Summary Profiles

### Appalachia

**Defining challenge:** Post-extraction economic collapse without replacement industry

**Healthcare crisis:** Hospital closures, workforce exodus, opioid epidemic epicenter

**Demographic pressure:** Out-migration of working-age adults, aging in place without services

**Political context:** Deep distrust of federal government, strong cultural identity, suspicion of outside intervention

**RHTP relevance:** High funding need, moderate-high allocation, implementation challenged by workforce absence

---

### Delta (Mississippi/Arkansas/Louisiana)

**Defining challenge:** Persistent poverty rooted in plantation economy legacy

**Healthcare crisis:** Worst health outcomes nationally, Medicaid non-expansion, severe provider shortage

**Demographic pressure:** Continued out-migration, aging population, majority-minority demographics

**Political context:** State governments historically resistant to federal health programs

**RHTP relevance:** Critical need, allocations constrained by state capacity and political will

---

### Black Belt South

**Defining challenge:** Historical disinvestment in majority-Black communities

**Healthcare crisis:** Hospital closures concentrated, maternal mortality crisis, specialty access absent

**Demographic pressure:** Young adult out-migration, elderly population growth, caregiving burden

**Political context:** Variation by state, some expansion (LA) vs. non-expansion (GA, AL)

**RHTP relevance:** High need, implementation dependent on state-level decisions

---

### Great Plains

**Defining challenge:** Agricultural consolidation and depopulation creating service deserts

**Healthcare crisis:** Distance rather than absence, CAH network stretched thin, EMS response times

**Demographic pressure:** Rapid aging, schools closing, communities below sustainability threshold

**Political context:** Strong self-reliance ethos, skepticism of government programs

**RHTP relevance:** Distance bonus in formula helps, but population loss undermines infrastructure viability

---

### Rural West

**Defining challenge:** Bifurcation between amenity-rich areas and struggling communities

**Healthcare crisis:** Tribal health disparities, frontier isolation, seasonal population swings

**Demographic pressure:** Amenity migration creating housing cost pressure, tribal communities often youngest

**Political context:** Libertarian threads, federal land tension, tribal sovereignty considerations

**RHTP relevance:** IHS coordination critical, state variation significant

---

### Upper Midwest

**Defining challenge:** Manufacturing decline without complete collapse

**Healthcare crisis:** Moderate but growing, workforce aging faster than replacement

**Demographic pressure:** Stable but slowly declining, immigration partially offsetting native out-migration

**Political context:** Strong civic infrastructure, cooperative traditions, pragmatic politics

**RHTP relevance:** Relatively strong implementation capacity, moderate need

---

### New England Rural

**Defining challenge:** High costs and aging population in otherwise functional systems

**Healthcare crisis:** Least severe nationally, but workforce aging and facility updates needed

**Demographic pressure:** Oldest population, in-migration of retirees, limited young family formation

**Political context:** Universal Medicaid expansion, strong state health departments

**RHTP relevance:** Lower formula allocation due to better baseline, implementation capacity strong

---

## Part VIII: Cross-Regional Analysis

### Regions Requiring Intensive RHTP Investment

| Rank | Region | Rationale |
|------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | Delta | Worst outcomes, weakest infrastructure, lowest capacity |
| 2 | Black Belt South | Comparable crisis to Delta, slightly better state capacity in some areas |
| 3 | Appalachia | Severe crisis with workforce absence, opioid overlay |
| 4 | Great Plains | Distance challenges unique, depopulation threatens all infrastructure |
| 5 | Rural West | Bifurcated needs, tribal health requires distinct approach |
| 6 | Upper Midwest | Moderate need, strong implementation potential |
| 7 | New England Rural | Lowest need, highest capacity |

### Regional Variation in Transformation Approach

| Approach | Best Fit Regions | Poor Fit Regions |
|----------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Telehealth expansion** | Great Plains, Rural West | Delta, Appalachia (broadband limits) |
| **Hub-and-spoke networks** | Upper Midwest, New England | Great Plains (distance), Delta (hub absence) |
| **Community health workers** | Delta, Black Belt, Appalachia | Great Plains (population density) |
| **Workforce loan repayment** | All regions | Effectiveness varies by baseline |
| **Hospital conversion (REH)** | Appalachia, Black Belt | Great Plains (distance makes ER-only risky) |
| **Mobile health units** | Great Plains, Rural West | New England (less needed) |

---

## Part IX: Data Sources and Methodology

### Primary Data Sources

- **Demographics:** Census Bureau ACS 5-year estimates, Population Estimates Program
- **Economics:** BEA Regional Economic Accounts, BLS QCEW, USDA ERS
- **Healthcare:** AHRF, AHA Annual Survey, CMS Provider Data, UNC Sheps Center
- **Health Outcomes:** CDC WONDER, NVSS, BRFSS
- **Social Infrastructure:** USDA Food Access Atlas, FCC Broadband Maps, various surveys

### Regional Boundary Sources

- **Appalachia:** Appalachian Regional Commission official designation
- **Delta:** Delta Regional Authority designation plus adjacent high-poverty counties
- **Black Belt:** Historical definition plus persistent poverty overlay
- **Great Plains:** USDA ERS farm-dependent counties plus adjacent
- **Rural West:** Mountain and intermountain nonmetro counties
- **Upper Midwest:** State-based definition of rural counties in WI, MN, MI, northern tier
- **New England:** State-based definition of nonmetro counties

### Limitations

- Regional boundaries are analytical constructs with inherent arbitrariness
- Within-region variation often exceeds between-region variation
- Data vintage varies by source (2020-2024)
- Some metrics unavailable at sub-state regional level
