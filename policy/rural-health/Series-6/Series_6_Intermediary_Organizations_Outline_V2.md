# Series 6: Intermediary Organizations
## Complete Outline (Version 2)

*Hospital associations, FQHC networks, primary care associations, AHECs, and regional organizations as implementation partners. The aggregators and translators between state agencies and frontline providers.*

# What This Series Adds Beyond Data Compilation

Series 6 is not a directory of intermediary organizations. It is an **analytical examination of whether intermediaries help or hinder transformation**, identifying inherent tensions in the intermediary model, surfacing competing views on their value, and assessing which models evidence supports.

**Analytical Value Proposition:**
1. **Expose the tension between member service and public good.** Intermediaries serve members (hospitals, FQHCs, physicians). RHTP serves communities. When transformation threatens member interests, whose side are intermediaries on?

2. **Assess the aggregation versus accountability tradeoff.** One subaward to an association is efficient. It also creates opacity between state agencies and actual implementation. This series examines what states trade when they route funds through intermediaries.

3. **Evaluate capacity versus legitimacy.** States could implement directly but lack provider trust. Intermediaries have trust but may lack transformation capacity. Understanding this tradeoff matters for implementation design.

4. **Distinguish incumbent infrastructure from captured rent-seeking.** Existing intermediaries have infrastructure that new entities cannot replicate quickly. They also have vested interests in maintaining the status quo. Which aspect dominates?

5. **Name the community accountability gap.** Intermediaries answer to members and funders, not communities. Rural residents have no voice in intermediary decisions affecting their care. This series examines whether this gap undermines transformation.

# Core Tensions

Every Series 6 article must explicitly engage at least two of these tensions, rather than cataloging organizations without analytical framing.

## Tension 1: Member Service vs. Public Good

Intermediaries exist to serve members. RHTP exists to serve communities. These interests sometimes align and sometimes conflict.

**The Member Service View:** Intermediaries have fiduciary obligations to members. Hospital associations must advocate for hospitals. PCAs must support FQHCs. Transformation that harms members violates the intermediary's fundamental purpose. Members pay dues for advocacy, not for facilitating their own displacement.

**The Public Good View:** RHTP invests public funds for community benefit, not provider benefit. Intermediaries that prioritize member protection over community need misuse public investment. Transformation sometimes requires facilities to close, services to relocate, or providers to change. Intermediaries that resist these changes obstruct transformation.

**The Evidence Question:** Do intermediaries that balance member service with public benefit produce better outcomes than those that prioritize members? Can organizations serve both masters?

## Tension 2: Aggregation vs. Accountability

States can issue one subaward to an association or hundreds to individual providers. Aggregation through intermediaries creates efficiency at the cost of accountability.

**The Aggregation View:** State agencies cannot manage relationships with thousands of rural providers. Intermediaries aggregate demand, standardize processes, and reduce administrative burden. Efficiency gains fund more services. The alternative is bureaucratic paralysis.

**The Accountability View:** When states subaward to intermediaries, they lose visibility into actual implementation. Intermediaries report what they want states to see. Problems get buried. Accountability exists in theory (subaward terms) but not practice (inadequate monitoring). States trade control for convenience.

**The Evidence Question:** How much accountability do states actually sacrifice through intermediary subawards? Can monitoring structures preserve accountability while capturing aggregation benefits?

## Tension 3: Capacity vs. Legitimacy

Effective implementation requires both capacity (expertise, systems, personnel) and legitimacy (trust, relationships, credibility). Intermediaries and state agencies have different strengths.

**The Capacity View:** State agencies have analytical capacity, compliance expertise, and consistent processes. Intermediaries often lack sophisticated systems, experienced staff, and quality controls. Direct state implementation would produce better results. Intermediaries are overhead, not infrastructure.

**The Legitimacy View:** State agencies are distant bureaucracies that rural providers distrust. Intermediaries have relationships built over decades. Providers share information with trusted intermediaries that they hide from state regulators. Legitimacy enables transformation that capacity alone cannot achieve.

**The Evidence Question:** When does legitimacy overcome capacity limitations? When does capacity deficit undermine even trusted intermediaries?

## Tension 4: Incumbent vs. Insurgent

Existing intermediaries have infrastructure. New entities have fresh perspectives. Neither is inherently superior.

**The Incumbent View:** Building organizational infrastructure takes years. Existing intermediaries have systems, staff, relationships, and institutional knowledge that new entities cannot replicate. Using incumbents enables immediate implementation. Creating new entities wastes years on organizational development.

**The Insurgent View:** Existing intermediaries are invested in the status quo. Their staff, relationships, and mental models reflect existing arrangements. Transformation requires new thinking that incumbents cannot provide. Purpose-built entities without legacy baggage can pursue transformation unencumbered.

**The Evidence Question:** Have incumbent intermediaries demonstrated transformation capacity, or do they mostly maintain status quo? Do new entities achieve transformation or just fail in new ways?

## Tension 5: Technical Assistance vs. Advocacy

Many intermediaries provide both technical assistance (helping members improve) and advocacy (representing member interests to government). These functions can conflict.

**The TA Priority View:** Technical assistance requires honesty. Telling a hospital it should consider closing or converting requires willingness to deliver hard truths. Intermediaries focused on advocacy cannot provide honest TA because they must protect member interests.

**The Advocacy Priority View:** Effective TA requires trust. Trust comes from demonstrated advocacy. Intermediaries that don't fight for members lose credibility. Without credibility, TA is ignored. Advocacy enables TA effectiveness.

**The Evidence Question:** Can the same organization provide honest TA while advocating for member interests? Or should TA and advocacy be separated?

# Alternative Perspectives to Surface

Beyond the tensions above, Series 6 must surface these competing views on intermediary value.

## The Disintermediation Argument

Technology enables direct state-to-provider relationships at scale that was impossible when intermediary models developed. CMS can reach providers through portals, webinars, and technical assistance contractors. States can distribute funds electronically and monitor implementation through data systems. Intermediary overhead could fund additional services instead. Maybe bypass them entirely.

**Strongest Version:** Every dollar to intermediaries is a dollar not reaching communities. Administrative overhead ranges from 15% to 40% depending on the organization. A $100 million subaward to a hospital association might deliver $60 million in services. Direct distribution would deliver more.

**Counter-Argument:** Technology reaches providers but does not build relationships or trust. Technical assistance requires human connection. Coordination requires convening. The overhead comparison ignores the value intermediaries add.

## The Capture Critique

Intermediaries may capture transformation funding to sustain themselves rather than transform communities. They become rent-seekers extracting value from federal investment. Their survival interests override transformation goals.

**Strongest Version:** Intermediaries proposed RHTP roles that match their existing capacity, not community needs. They designed TA programs around staff they already employ. They structured subawards to guarantee revenue regardless of outcomes. Their sustainability requires continued government funding, creating incentive to perpetuate problems rather than solve them.

**Counter-Argument:** Intermediary survival serves transformation. Organizations that cease to exist cannot deliver future services. Building sustainable intermediaries creates infrastructure for ongoing support. Self-interest and public interest can align.

## The Necessary Infrastructure Defense

States cannot replicate intermediary relationships and expertise in transformation timelines. Intermediaries represent decades of investment in rural health infrastructure. Attempting to bypass them creates chaos, delays, and implementation failure. The choice is not between intermediaries and something better, but between intermediaries and nothing.

**Strongest Version:** Rural health infrastructure is thin everywhere. In many states, hospital associations and PCAs are the only organizations with rural health expertise. State agencies have no alternative partners. Criticizing intermediaries without identifying superior alternatives is empty analysis.

**Counter-Argument:** Intermediary necessity is partly self-created. By accepting intermediary roles, states never developed alternative capacity. The necessity argument perpetuates dependency. Breaking the cycle requires accepting short-term disruption.

## The Community Accountability Gap

Current intermediaries answer to members (providers) and funders (state agencies), not communities. Rural residents have no voice in intermediary decisions affecting their care. Hospital associations advocate for hospitals, not patients. PCAs represent FQHCs, not the populations they serve. This accountability structure may fundamentally misdirect transformation.

**Strongest Version:** RHTP is supposed to transform rural health for communities. But implementation is controlled by organizations accountable to providers and governments. Community benefit is assumed to follow from provider benefit. This assumption may be wrong. Provider-accountable intermediaries may perpetuate provider-serving arrangements rather than transform toward community-serving arrangements.

**Counter-Argument:** Providers are community members too. Provider survival enables community care. The distinction between provider interests and community interests is often false. Community-accountable structures exist (FQHC boards, CAH community benefit) even if imperfect.

# Individual Article Outlines

## RHTP 6.A
## Hospital Associations: Member Advocates or Transformation Agents?

**Core Tension:** Member Service vs. Public Good

Hospital associations exist to represent hospital interests. RHTP transformation may require hospital closures, conversions, and consolidations. Can organizations whose members are threatened by transformation lead transformation?

**Introduction**
- Hospital associations receive major RHTP subawards
- Their mission is member advocacy
- Transformation may threaten members
- The question: Can they serve both masters?

**The Member Service Imperative**
- Association governance by member hospitals
- Revenue from member dues and services
- Advocacy as core function
- Why member hospitals expect protection

**The Transformation Challenge**
- RHTP requires transformation, not preservation
- Some hospitals should close or convert
- Regional networks may reduce hospital autonomy
- Where transformation directly threatens association members

**State Hospital Association Landscape**

| Association | State | Members | Budget | RHTP Role | Subaward | Staff | Rural Focus |
|-------------|-------|---------|--------|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| TORCH | Texas | 164 rural | $4.2M | TA, advocacy | $12M | 18 | Primary |
| [Others] | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**[VIGNETTE: State hospital association receives RHTP subaward for transformation TA. Member hospital in distress requests help. Association analysis shows hospital should close, services should move to regional hub. Association faces choice: deliver honest TA or protect member. What happens? What does it reveal?]**

**Alternative Perspective: The Necessary Infrastructure Defense**
- Hospital associations have relationships no one else has
- Rural hospitals trust their association
- State agencies cannot replicate these relationships
- Assessment: Partially valid. Relationships matter. But relationships constrained by member advocacy may not serve transformation.

**RHTP Subaward Analysis**
- How associations structure their RHTP roles
- Pass-through percentages and overhead
- TA content: compliance-focused or transformation-focused?
- Evidence on transformation contribution

**When Hospital Associations Help Transformation**
- Network development where all members benefit
- Shared services that strengthen members
- Policy advocacy for payment reform
- Peer learning across institutions

**When Hospital Associations Hinder Transformation**
- Protection of members that should close or convert
- Advocacy against regional consolidation
- TA focused on member survival, not community need
- Capture of transformation funding for member services

**Recommendations**
- For states: Structure subawards around transformation outcomes, not member service
- For associations: Acknowledge transformation may require member sacrifice
- For CMS: Monitor whether association TA produces transformation or preservation

## RHTP 6.B
## FQHC Networks and Primary Care Associations: Safety Net Infrastructure

**Core Tension:** Capacity vs. Legitimacy

PCAs and FQHC networks have deep relationships with safety-net providers but variable capacity for transformation support. Some are sophisticated organizations with substantial expertise. Others are skeletal operations that exist primarily to receive federal funds.

**Introduction**
- PCAs receive Bureau of Primary Health Care funding
- State networks coordinate FQHCs and look-alikes
- Legitimacy with safety-net providers is high
- Capacity varies dramatically

**The Legitimacy Foundation**
- PCAs have served FQHCs for decades
- Trust built through consistent support
- Understanding of FQHC operations, regulations, challenges
- Relationships state agencies cannot replicate

**The Capacity Question**
- PCA staffing ranges from 3 FTEs to 50+
- Technical expertise varies enormously
- Many PCAs have never managed transformation programs
- Subaward scope may exceed organizational capacity

**PCA and Network Landscape**

| Organization | State | Members | Staff | Budget | RHTP Role | Subaward | Capacity Assessment |
|--------------|-------|---------|-------|--------|-----------|----------|---------------------|
| [Name] | [State] | [FQHCs] | [FTE] | [Annual] | [Functions] | [Amount] | High/Moderate/Low |

**[VIGNETTE: PCA with strong legitimacy but limited capacity receives major transformation subaward. Organization has trusted relationships but not technical expertise. First year reveals gap between relationship value and implementation capacity. How does state respond? What does it suggest about the legitimacy-capacity tradeoff?]**

**Alternative Perspective: The Capture Critique**
- PCAs depend on federal and state funding
- Their survival requires continued need
- Transformation that reduced FQHC struggles would reduce PCA relevance
- Assessment: The structural incentive exists. But FQHCs face challenges unlikely to disappear. Capture risk is moderate, not determinative.

**RHTP Subaward Analysis**
- How PCAs structure their transformation roles
- TA content and quality
- Coordination functions versus direct implementation
- Evidence on value-add

**When PCAs Help Transformation**
- TA aligned with FQHC operational challenges
- Peer learning networks that spread innovation
- Advocacy for payment and regulatory reform
- Quality improvement support

**When PCAs Hinder Transformation**
- TA focused on compliance rather than improvement
- Protection of underperforming FQHCs
- Overhead that absorbs transformation investment
- Capacity mismatches that delay implementation

**Recommendations**
- For states: Match subaward scope to demonstrated capacity
- For PCAs: Honest assessment of transformation capacity versus legitimacy claims
- For CMS: Capacity-building investment in under-resourced PCAs

## RHTP 6.C
## Regional Health Information Organizations: Data Infrastructure or Overhead?

**Core Tension:** Technical Value vs. Overhead Cost

RHIOs and HIEs promise data infrastructure that enables care coordination and population health management. Reality is mixed. Some provide genuine technical value. Others absorb resources while delivering limited functionality.

**Introduction**
- HIE infrastructure varies enormously by state
- Some RHIOs have sophisticated capabilities
- Others exist primarily on paper
- RHTP assumes data infrastructure that may not exist

**The Technical Promise**
- Data exchange enables care coordination
- Population health requires aggregated data
- Clinical decision support needs integrated information
- Transformation depends on information infrastructure

**The Overhead Reality**
- HIE sustainability has proven challenging
- Many RHIOs depend on grant funding
- Technical capabilities often lag promises
- Value delivered may not justify cost

**RHIO and HIE Landscape**

| Organization | State | Participants | Data Volume | Functionality | RHTP Role | Subaward | Value Assessment |
|--------------|-------|--------------|-------------|---------------|-----------|----------|------------------|
| [Name] | [State] | [Providers] | [Records] | [Capabilities] | [Functions] | [Amount] | High/Moderate/Low |

**[VIGNETTE: State invests RHTP funds in RHIO to support transformation data infrastructure. Two years later, actual data exchange remains minimal. RHIO reports extensive activities. State lacks technical expertise to assess claims. What does this reveal about RHIO oversight challenges?]**

**Alternative Perspective: The Disintermediation Argument**
- National networks (Carequality, CommonWell) enable direct data exchange
- EHR vendors offer built-in interoperability
- State-level RHIOs may be obsolete infrastructure
- Assessment: Partially valid for clinical exchange. Less valid for public health and population health data. State-level infrastructure may retain value for specific functions.

**RHTP Subaward Analysis**
- How RHIOs structure their RHTP roles
- Technical deliverables versus activity reports
- Evidence of actual functionality versus claims
- Sustainability models

**When RHIOs Help Transformation**
- States with mature, functional HIE infrastructure
- Population health data aggregation for rural areas
- Public health data integration
- Quality measurement support

**When RHIOs Hinder Transformation**
- Overhead absorption without technical delivery
- Promises exceeding demonstrated capability
- Sustainability models that don't survive RHTP
- Competition with national exchange networks

**Recommendations**
- For states: Independent technical assessment of RHIO capabilities before subaward
- For RHIOs: Demonstrate specific value versus national alternatives
- For CMS: Technical standards that reveal actual versus claimed functionality

## RHTP 6.D
## Area Health Education Centers: Workforce Pipeline Infrastructure

**Core Tension:** Incumbent vs. Insurgent

AHECs have existed for decades, building relationships with health professions schools and clinical training sites. Their infrastructure could accelerate workforce development, or their incumbent status could perpetuate approaches that haven't solved rural workforce shortages.

**Introduction**
- AHEC program dates to 1972
- Coverage varies dramatically by state
- Relationships with academic health centers are core asset
- Workforce shortages persist despite decades of AHEC activity

**The Incumbent Infrastructure**
- 56 AHEC programs, 300+ centers
- Established relationships with training programs
- Clinical rotation coordination experience
- Educational programming infrastructure

**The Insurgent Question**
- Rural workforce shortages persist after 50 years
- Current approaches haven't solved the problem
- AHEC mental models may limit innovation
- Fresh approaches might achieve what incumbents haven't

**AHEC Landscape**

| AHEC | State | Centers | Training Sites | Residents Placed | RHTP Role | Subaward | Outcome Evidence |
|------|-------|---------|----------------|------------------|-----------|----------|------------------|
| [Name] | [State] | [Count] | [Sites] | [Annual] | [Functions] | [Amount] | [What we know] |

**[VIGNETTE: State debates AHEC subaward for workforce development. AHEC proposes expansion of existing programs. Alternative proposal from community organization suggests different approach based on apprenticeship and local hiring. State must choose between proven infrastructure and potentially superior innovation. What happens?]**

**Alternative Perspective: The Transformation Impossibility View**
- Workforce shortages reflect structural factors AHECs cannot address
- Training capacity is limited by GME slots, not AHEC programs
- Rural retention depends on community factors, not educational interventions
- Assessment: Partially valid. AHECs cannot solve workforce shortages alone. But they can contribute to solutions as part of broader strategy. The impossibility view overstates the case.

**RHTP Subaward Analysis**
- How AHECs structure their RHTP roles
- Program expansion versus innovation
- Evidence on rural placement outcomes
- Pipeline metrics versus retention metrics

**When AHECs Help Transformation**
- States with strong academic health center partnerships
- Integration with other workforce strategies
- Focus on retention, not just training
- Adaptation to rural community needs

**When AHECs Hinder Transformation**
- Replication of approaches that haven't worked
- Training volume metrics without retention outcomes
- Incumbent mental models blocking innovation
- Overhead that doesn't translate to providers

**Recommendations**
- For states: Assess AHEC outcomes, not activities, before subaward
- For AHECs: Demonstrate willingness to abandon approaches that don't work
- For CMS: Fund alternative workforce approaches to test AHEC assumptions

## RHTP 6.E
## Public Health Districts and Coalitions: Population Health Infrastructure

**Core Tension:** Aggregation vs. Accountability

Public health districts and coalitions coordinate across jurisdictions, aggregating functions that small health departments cannot perform alone. This aggregation creates efficiency but distances services from community accountability.

**Introduction**
- Public health infrastructure fragmented across thousands of local departments
- Multi-county districts and regional coalitions aggregate capacity
- Aggregation creates efficiency and distance
- Community accountability may suffer

**The Aggregation Efficiency**
- Small health departments lack specialized capacity
- Regional approaches enable expertise concentration
- Epidemiology, emergency preparedness, workforce require scale
- Aggregation may be only path to capacity

**The Accountability Distance**
- Local health departments answer to local government
- Regional entities answer to boards, not communities
- Population health decisions affect communities without community voice
- Aggregation creates democracy deficit

**Public Health Coalition Landscape**

| Organization | State | Jurisdictions | Population | Staff | RHTP Role | Subaward | Accountability Structure |
|--------------|-------|---------------|------------|-------|-----------|----------|-------------------------|
| [Name] | [State] | [Counties] | [Population] | [FTE] | [Functions] | [Amount] | [Who governs] |

**[VIGNETTE: Regional public health coalition makes decision on disease surveillance priorities. Priorities reflect epidemiological data but not community input. Communities affected by decision had no voice in making it. Efficient? Yes. Accountable? To whom?]**

**Alternative Perspective: The Community Accountability Gap**
- Public health coalitions answer to member jurisdictions, not populations
- Low-income and minority communities may be underrepresented
- Aggregation may reproduce existing inequities
- Assessment: Substantially valid. Regional public health governance often lacks community voice. RHTP transformation should address this gap, not replicate it.

**RHTP Subaward Analysis**
- How coalitions structure their RHTP roles
- Population health functions versus administration
- Community engagement (real versus performative)
- Evidence on outcomes

**When Public Health Coalitions Help Transformation**
- Capacity that small departments cannot achieve alone
- Coordination across fragmented systems
- Population health data and analytics
- Emergency and outbreak response

**When Public Health Coalitions Hinder Transformation**
- Accountability structures that exclude community voice
- Priorities set without population input
- Efficiency gains that don't reach communities
- Distance from local needs

**Recommendations**
- For states: Require community representation in coalition governance
- For coalitions: Demonstrate accountability to populations, not just jurisdictions
- For CMS: Assess community voice in coalition-managed programs

## RHTP 6.F
## Multi-Stakeholder Collaboratives: Purpose-Built or Coordination Theater?

**Core Tension:** Community Voice vs. Provider Control

Multi-stakeholder collaboratives promise inclusive governance with community voice. Reality often involves provider-dominated boards making decisions that communities ratify rather than shape.

**Introduction**
- RHTP encourages multi-stakeholder governance
- Collaboratives assemble diverse participants
- Provider and institutional interests often dominate
- Community voice may be token rather than substantive

**The Inclusive Governance Promise**
- Rural health affects entire communities
- Decisions should reflect diverse perspectives
- Collaboratives can aggregate community voice
- Democratic legitimacy through participation

**The Provider Control Reality**
- Health systems have resources to participate
- Community members lack time and expertise
- Provider interests shape agendas and options
- Community voice becomes ratification of provider plans

**Collaborative Landscape**

| Collaborative | State | Governance | Provider Seats | Community Seats | Budget | RHTP Role | Power Assessment |
|---------------|-------|------------|----------------|-----------------|--------|-----------|------------------|
| [Name] | [State] | [Structure] | [Count] | [Count] | [Amount] | [Functions] | Provider/Balanced/Community |

**[VIGNETTE: Multi-stakeholder collaborative meets to decide RHTP priorities. Hospital CEO proposes technology investment. Community member suggests transportation. Discussion focuses on technology. Transportation receives minimal attention. Both participate. One voice matters.]**

**Alternative Perspective: The Necessary Infrastructure Defense**
- Collaboratives are only structures that include all stakeholders
- Imperfect participation beats no participation
- Building community voice takes time
- Assessment: Partially valid. Collaboratives can include community voice. But inclusion is not influence. Structures that include community voice without giving it power provide legitimacy for provider priorities.

**RHTP Subaward Analysis**
- How collaboratives structure their roles
- Decision-making authority versus advisory function
- Community member compensation and support
- Evidence on priority alignment with community needs

**When Collaboratives Help Transformation**
- Governance structures that give community members actual power
- Support enabling community participation (compensation, childcare, translation)
- Priorities that reflect community input
- Accountability to populations, not just participants

**When Collaboratives Hinder Transformation**
- Provider-dominated governance despite inclusive appearance
- Community voice as legitimization of predetermined priorities
- Coordination theater without substantive engagement
- Resources consumed by process rather than outcomes

**Recommendations**
- For states: Assess power distribution, not just participation
- For collaboratives: Demonstrate how community input shaped priorities
- For CMS: Require evidence of community influence, not just presence

# Synthesis Article

## RHTP 6.Synthesis
## Do Intermediaries Help or Hinder Transformation?

**Purpose:** Integrate findings across Series 6 articles to answer whether intermediaries strengthen or weaken rural health transformation.

**Core Question:** Under what conditions do intermediaries add value, and when do they extract resources that should reach communities?

**Section 1: The Intermediary Question**

RHTP assumes intermediaries add value. State agencies lack capacity to reach thousands of rural providers directly. Intermediaries aggregate, coordinate, and translate. But intermediary involvement creates overhead, opacity, and potential capture. The question is not whether intermediaries matter, but whether their contribution exceeds their cost.

**Section 2: Cross-Article Synthesis**

| Intermediary Type | Core Tension | Value Evidence | Risk Evidence | Net Assessment |
|-------------------|--------------|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| Hospital Associations | Member vs. Public | [Summary] | [Summary] | Conditional |
| PCAs/FQHC Networks | Capacity vs. Legitimacy | [Summary] | [Summary] | Generally positive |
| RHIOs | Technical vs. Overhead | [Summary] | [Summary] | Highly variable |
| AHECs | Incumbent vs. Insurgent | [Summary] | [Summary] | Uncertain |
| Public Health Coalitions | Aggregation vs. Accountability | [Summary] | [Summary] | Mixed |
| Collaboratives | Community vs. Provider | [Summary] | [Summary] | Generally negative |

**Section 3: When Intermediaries Add Value**

Evidence supports intermediary value when:
- Clear accountability to state agencies with transformation metrics
- Capacity demonstrably exceeds what states could provide directly
- Member/stakeholder trust enables honest engagement
- Overhead is proportionate to documented value-add
- Path to sustainability beyond RHTP exists

**Section 4: When Intermediaries Extract Value**

Evidence suggests intermediary rent-seeking when:
- Overhead exceeds 30% without documented transformation outcomes
- TA content focuses on compliance rather than improvement
- Member protection trumps transformation when they conflict
- Activities substitute for outcomes in reporting
- Sustainability depends on perpetuating problems

**Section 5: Alternative Perspective Assessment**

| Perspective | Evidence Assessment | Implication |
|-------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Disintermediation Argument | Partially valid for some functions; technology reduces but doesn't eliminate need | States should assess intermediary value function by function |
| Capture Critique | Structurally valid; intermediary survival requires continued need | Accountability structures must address capture incentives |
| Necessary Infrastructure Defense | Valid in thin markets; less valid where alternatives exist | Necessity should be assessed, not assumed |
| Community Accountability Gap | Strongly supported; intermediaries answer to providers, not communities | Governance reform needed, not just participation |

**[VIGNETTE: Contrasting two states with different intermediary strategies. State A heavily intermediated: hospital association, PCA, AHEC, RHIO all receive major subawards. State B minimally intermediated: direct provider relationships with targeted TA. Year 3 outcomes comparison. Which approach produced more transformation? What does it suggest?]**

**Section 6: The Honest Assessment**

Intermediaries are neither universally helpful nor universally harmful. Value depends on:
- **Function fit**: Some functions suit intermediaries; others don't
- **Organizational quality**: Wide variation within each intermediary type
- **Accountability structure**: Whether incentives align with transformation
- **State capacity**: Whether alternatives to intermediaries exist
- **Community voice**: Whether affected populations have influence

The romanticized view (intermediaries as essential infrastructure) is oversimplified.
The cynical view (intermediaries as rent-seekers) is also oversimplified.
The honest view: careful assessment of specific organizations against specific functions, with accountability structures that reward transformation rather than activity.

**Section 7: Recommendations**

**For State Agencies:**
1. Assess intermediary value function by function, not organization by organization
2. Require transformation outcomes, not activity metrics
3. Maintain direct relationships alongside intermediary channels
4. Build evaluation capacity independent of intermediary self-reporting
5. Address community accountability gap in governance requirements
6. Plan for post-2030 intermediary sustainability

**For Intermediary Organizations:**
1. Acknowledge when member interests and transformation goals conflict
2. Demonstrate value-add beyond what states could provide directly
3. Operate transparently about overhead and outcomes
4. Accept outcome accountability, not just activity reporting
5. Build sustainable models that don't require perpetuating problems

**For CMS:**
1. Monitor intermediary overhead across states
2. Require outcome evidence, not just participation documentation
3. Support direct-to-provider channels as alternative
4. Fund community voice in intermediary governance
5. Enable state flexibility while maintaining accountability

**Section 8: Transition to Series 7**

Series 6 examined intermediaries from the state agency perspective. Series 7 examines how providers experience RHTP implementation, including their relationships with the intermediaries analyzed here. The provider perspective will test whether intermediary value perceived at state level translates to value experienced at community level.

# Execution Guidance

## Research Protocol

**Primary Sources**
1. Intermediary organization websites and annual reports
2. IRS Form 990 filings (financial data, executive compensation)
3. State RHTP subaward documentation
4. Membership directories and rosters
5. State agency reports on intermediary performance
6. CMS cooperative agreement documentation

**Secondary Sources**
1. Policy analyses from NASHP, NCSL, NGA
2. Academic research on intermediary effectiveness
3. News coverage of intermediary activities
4. Conference presentations and webinar recordings

**Analytical Sources**
1. Research on organizational capture and rent-seeking
2. Implementation science literature
3. Community accountability frameworks
4. Governance and participation research

## Quality Standards

**Each article must:**
- Engage at least two core tensions explicitly
- Surface and assess at least one alternative perspective
- Include 1 to 2 vignettes illustrating tensions
- Name specific organizations with concrete data (budget, staff, subawards)
- Assess capacity honestly, including limitations
- Distinguish value-add from overhead
- Avoid treating all intermediaries as equivalent

**Avoid:**
- Generic descriptions without organizational specifics
- Accepting organizational self-descriptions uncritically
- Ignoring conflicts of interest
- Treating intermediary involvement as inherently valuable
- Recommending intermediary use without capacity assessment
- Ignoring sustainability concerns
- **Cataloging without analyzing**
- **Describing without assessing**

## Sequence Priority

**Phase 1:**
- 6A: Hospital Associations (most common subawardee)
- 6B: PCAs (safety-net infrastructure)

**Phase 2:**
- 6D: AHECs (workforce connection)
- 6C: RHIOs (data infrastructure)

**Phase 3:**
- 6E: Public Health (coordination role)
- 6F: Collaboratives (governance models)

**Phase 4:**
- TD-A: Intermediary Landscape (reference compilation)
- Synthesis: Integration and assessment
