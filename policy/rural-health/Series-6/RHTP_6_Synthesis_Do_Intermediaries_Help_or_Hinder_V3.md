# RHTP 6.Synthesis
# Intermediary Organizations
## Do They Help or Hinder Transformation?

## The Intermediary Question

RHTP implementation assumes intermediaries add value. State agencies lack capacity to reach thousands of rural providers directly. They cannot maintain relationships with every Critical Access Hospital, FQHC, and rural clinic. They lack specialized expertise in workforce development, health information exchange, and population health management. Intermediaries fill these gaps, aggregating providers, coordinating activities, and translating policy into practice.

But intermediary involvement comes with costs. **Overhead absorbs resources that could otherwise reach providers and communities.** Organizational interests may diverge from transformation goals. Accountability becomes diffuse when funding flows through multiple layers. The question confronting RHTP implementation is not whether intermediaries matter but whether their contribution exceeds their cost.

Series 6 examined six intermediary types through a consistent analytical lens: identifying core tensions, assessing value evidence, documenting risks, and evaluating whether specific organizational categories help or hinder transformation under identifiable conditions. This synthesis integrates those findings to answer the central question.

## Cross-Article Synthesis

### Summary of Findings by Intermediary Type

| Intermediary Type | Core Tension | Value Evidence | Risk Evidence | Net Assessment |
|-------------------|--------------|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Hospital Associations** | Member Service vs. Public Good | Strong network development, peer learning, policy advocacy | Member protection may conflict with transformation; conversion resistance | **Conditional**: Value when transformation aligns with member interests; risk when it requires member sacrifice |
| **FQHC Networks/PCAs** | Capacity vs. Legitimacy | Deep safety-net relationships, FQHC operational expertise, CHW training capacity | Capacity varies dramatically; legitimacy can mask limitations; subaward scope may exceed capacity | **Generally Positive**: High legitimacy enables transformation engagement; capacity must be independently verified |
| **RHIOs/HIEs** | Technical Value vs. Overhead Cost | Data infrastructure enabling care coordination; population health analytics potential | Activity metrics obscure low utilization (4.7% clinical access in mature systems); overhead may exceed value; national networks may obviate state RHIOs | **Highly Variable**: Value depends on actual functionality, not connectivity claims; independent technical assessment essential |
| **AHECs** | Incumbent vs. Insurgent | 50+ years infrastructure, educational relationships, pipeline programs | Evidence for activities extensive, outcomes limited; incumbent bias may resist innovation; rural origin predicts practice more than training exposure | **Uncertain**: Substantial infrastructure with uncertain transformation impact; alternative approaches deserve parallel investment |
| **Public Health Coalitions** | Aggregation vs. Accountability | Capacity small departments cannot achieve alone; coordination across fragmented systems | Accountability to jurisdictions not populations; democracy deficit in regional governance; efficiency may not reach communities | **Mixed**: Aggregation necessary for specialized functions; community voice mechanisms essential |
| **Multi-Stakeholder Collaboratives** | Community Voice vs. Provider Control | Only structures including all stakeholders; potential for community participation | Provider domination despite inclusive appearance; community voice as legitimization not influence; coordination theater | **Generally Negative**: Most operate at tokenism levels; authentic community power rare; resources often consumed by process |

### The Conditional Value Pattern

A consistent pattern emerges across intermediary types: **value is conditional rather than inherent**. No intermediary category uniformly helps or hinders transformation. Effectiveness depends on specific organizational characteristics, accountability structures, and alignment between intermediary interests and transformation goals.

**Hospital associations** add value when transformation strengthens member hospitals through network development and shared services. They subtract value when transformation requires member closure, conversion, or market share loss. The TORCH network in Texas demonstrates value-add through peer learning and network coordination. The hypothetical association protecting a member hospital that should convert to REH demonstrates value extraction.

**PCAs** add value when their legitimacy with safety-net providers enables honest engagement about difficult transformation. They subtract value when legitimacy masks capacity limitations, and health centers receive inadequate support from trusted sources. The Colorado CCHN demonstrates value through sophisticated CHW training programs. The West Virginia PCA vignette demonstrates risk when subaward scope exceeds organizational capacity.

**RHIOs** add value when they provide functionality that national networks and EHR interoperability cannot replicate. They subtract value when activity metrics obscure minimal clinical utility, and overhead consumes resources without proportionate benefit. Maryland CRISP demonstrates value through genuine integration. The "Activity Report Problem" vignette demonstrates risk when extensive reporting masks limited functionality.

**AHECs** add value when their infrastructure accelerates workforce pipeline development with demonstrated retention outcomes. They subtract value when incumbent status protects approaches that do not work, and transformation funding flows to traditional programs rather than innovation. North Carolina AHEC demonstrates value through outcome tracking. The "Innovation Dilemma" vignette demonstrates risk when compromise between incumbent and insurgent approaches serves neither well.

**Public health coalitions** add value when aggregation enables specialized functions small departments cannot achieve while preserving community accountability. They subtract value when efficiency gains do not reach communities, and regional governance distances decisions from affected populations. The Northeast Public Health Collaborative demonstrates value through voluntary coordination preserving state accountability. The "Surveillance Priority Decision" vignette demonstrates risk when technical expertise drives decisions without community voice.

**Multi-stakeholder collaboratives** add value when governance structures give community members actual power over priorities. They subtract value when inclusive appearance legitimizes provider-dominated decisions, and community participation becomes ratification rather than influence. The "Community-Led Alternative" vignette demonstrates value through community councils with majority community membership. The "Technology Priority" vignette demonstrates risk when both stakeholders participate but only one voice matters.

## When Intermediaries Add Value

Evidence across Series 6 articles supports intermediary value under specific conditions:

**Clear accountability to state agencies with transformation metrics.** Intermediaries operating under outcome-based contracts with independent verification add demonstrable value. Activity-based reporting without outcome accountability enables overhead extraction.

**Capacity demonstrably exceeding what states could provide directly.** Intermediary involvement is justified when organizations possess expertise, relationships, or infrastructure that state agencies cannot replicate. Generic coordination that states could perform directly does not justify intermediary overhead.

**Member or stakeholder trust enabling honest engagement.** Intermediaries can deliver difficult messages that state agencies cannot. Hospital associations can facilitate conversations about closure. PCAs can engage health centers about transformation requirements. This trust-based value exists only when intermediaries prioritize transformation over member protection.

**Overhead proportionate to documented value-add.** Some overhead is inevitable. Coordination requires staff. Technical assistance requires expertise. But overhead exceeding 25-30% without documented transformation contribution suggests value extraction rather than value creation.

**Sustainable models not dependent on perpetuating problems.** Intermediaries with business models requiring ongoing transformation challenges face perverse incentives. Organizations that succeed by building provider capacity and eventually becoming unnecessary demonstrate transformation alignment.

## When Intermediaries Extract Value

Evidence across Series 6 articles suggests intermediary rent-seeking under different conditions:

**Overhead exceeding 30% without documented transformation outcomes.** High overhead is not inherently problematic if transformation results justify the investment. But high overhead combined with activity reporting rather than outcome evidence suggests resources absorbed without proportionate benefit.

**Technical assistance focused on compliance rather than improvement.** TA that helps providers meet program requirements without transforming care delivery serves intermediary sustainability more than transformation goals. Compliance-focused TA perpetuates intermediary need without addressing underlying challenges.

**Member protection trumping transformation when they conflict.** The core tension facing membership organizations is whether they serve members or transformation goals when these diverge. Intermediaries that consistently prioritize member interests over transformation requirements extract resources meant for transformation.

**Activities substituting for outcomes in reporting.** Webinars conducted, technical assistance sessions delivered, providers connected: these activity metrics tell states what intermediaries did, not what they accomplished. Activity reporting without outcome accountability enables intermediary survival without transformation contribution.

**Sustainability dependent on perpetuating problems.** If intermediary business models require ongoing rural health challenges, organizational incentives oppose the transformation that would reduce need for their services. This structural conflict creates rent-seeking behavior even among well-intentioned organizations.

## Alternative Perspective Assessment

Series 6 articles engaged multiple alternative perspectives challenging the intermediary-critical analysis. Each deserves fair assessment:

### The Disintermediation Argument

**Claim:** Technology increasingly enables direct relationships, reducing intermediary necessity. National health information networks (TEFCA, Carequality), EHR vendor interoperability, and direct federal-provider relationships may obviate state-level intermediaries.

**Assessment:** Partially valid for some functions. Large health systems can connect directly to national networks without state RHIO intermediation. HRSA maintains direct relationships with FQHCs that could bypass state PCAs. But disintermediation works less well for small rural providers lacking IT capacity, for coordination functions requiring local relationships, and for community engagement requiring trusted local presence.

**Implication:** States should assess intermediary necessity function by function rather than assuming all intermediary roles remain essential. Some functions suit disintermediation; others do not.

### The Capture Critique

**Claim:** Intermediary organizations inevitably prioritize organizational survival over transformation goals. Membership organizations serve members. Grant-dependent organizations serve funders. Neither serves communities unless accountability structures compel community alignment.

**Assessment:** Structurally valid. Organizational survival requires satisfying stakeholders who control resources. For membership organizations, members control resources through dues. For grant-dependent organizations, funders control resources through awards. Community voice is structurally weak unless governance arrangements give communities actual power.

**Implication:** Accountability structures must address capture incentives directly. Outcome-based contracts, independent evaluation, and community governance can counteract capture tendencies but require intentional design.

### The Necessary Infrastructure Defense

**Claim:** Intermediaries represent essential infrastructure that cannot be replicated. Relationships built over decades enable engagement that state agencies cannot achieve. Specialized expertise accumulated through years of practice cannot be quickly rebuilt. Eliminating intermediaries would leave gaps that harm transformation.

**Assessment:** Valid in thin markets where alternatives do not exist. Rural states with limited organizational infrastructure may have no alternatives to existing intermediaries regardless of those intermediaries' limitations. But necessity should be assessed rather than assumed. Urban areas and states with robust organizational ecosystems may have alternatives that render intermediary involvement optional rather than essential.

**Implication:** State agencies should evaluate intermediary necessity based on actual alternatives rather than accepting necessity claims at face value. Where alternatives exist, competition can discipline intermediary performance. Where alternatives do not exist, stronger accountability structures become essential.

### The Community Accountability Gap

**Claim:** Intermediaries answer to members, funders, and state agencies, not to communities served. This accountability gap is structural, not incidental. Reform requires governance change, not just participation.

**Assessment:** Strongly supported across Series 6 articles. Hospital associations answer to member hospitals. PCAs answer to member health centers. RHIOs answer to connected providers. Public health coalitions answer to member jurisdictions. Collaboratives answer to participating organizations. In none of these structures do affected communities hold governance power.

**Implication:** Addressing the accountability gap requires governance reform that gives communities actual decision-making authority, not just advisory roles. Participation without power provides legitimacy for decisions communities do not control.

## Vignette: Two States, Two Approaches

Consider two hypothetical states implementing RHTP with different intermediary strategies.

**State A: Heavy Intermediation.** The state awards major subawards to its hospital association ($80M for network development and technical assistance), PCA ($45M for safety-net transformation), AHEC ($35M for workforce pipeline), and RHIO ($25M for data infrastructure). A multi-stakeholder collaborative receives $15M for coordination. Total intermediary investment: $200M, approximately 45% of the state's $440M RHTP award.

The state's rationale: intermediaries have relationships state agencies cannot replicate. The hospital association knows every rural hospital. The PCA has served health centers for decades. The AHEC has trained the rural workforce for years. Building these relationships from scratch would take years the state does not have.

**State B: Minimal Intermediation.** The state maintains direct relationships with rural hospitals and health centers, using competitive procurement for targeted technical assistance. Small subawards support specific functions: $8M to the hospital association for peer learning networks, $6M to the PCA for CHW training, $4M to the AHEC for preceptor development. Total intermediary investment: $18M, approximately 4% of the state's $440M award.

The state's rationale: intermediary overhead absorbs resources better directed to providers. Direct relationships enable faster problem identification and resolution. Competitive procurement attracts specialized expertise matched to specific needs rather than general-purpose intermediary capacity.

**Year 3 Comparison:**

State A reports impressive activity metrics. The hospital association has conducted 234 technical assistance engagements, convened 18 peer learning sessions, and supported network formation across 4 regions. The PCA has trained 156 staff across 28 health centers, deployed CHW programs in 12 communities, and coordinated behavioral health integration pilots at 8 sites. The AHEC has supported 89 student rotations, developed 34 preceptor relationships, and graduated 22 participants from its rural track program. The RHIO has connected 67% of rural providers to the state health information exchange and processed 2.3 million clinical messages. The collaborative has convened 42 stakeholder meetings with average attendance of 67 participants.

But outcome metrics are less impressive. Rural hospital financial margins have not improved; 3 hospitals remain at risk of closure despite $80M in hospital association investment. Access metrics show minimal change; primary care appointment availability remains at 72% of urban levels. Workforce shortages persist; primary care vacancy rates declined only 2 percentage points against a target of 15. Health outcomes remain unchanged from baseline; diabetes control rates, maternal mortality, and preventable hospitalizations show no statistically significant improvement.

State B reports fewer activities but different outcomes. Direct provider relationships enabled rapid identification and resolution of implementation barriers. When the state discovered that telehealth reimbursement rules were blocking expansion, direct hospital relationships enabled policy correction within 60 days rather than filtering through intermediary communication channels. Competitive procurement attracted specialized behavioral health integration expertise that the state's AHEC could not provide, accelerating integration timelines by 8 months.

Rural hospital margins improved 3.2 percentage points through targeted operational support. Access metrics improved in 7 of 12 target communities, with primary care appointment availability reaching 89% of urban levels. Workforce recruitment exceeded targets in primary care, with vacancy rates declining 18 percentage points through direct recruitment incentives that reached clinicians faster than intermediary-administered programs. Diabetes control rates improved 4.2 percentage points in communities receiving direct transformation support.

**What Explains the Difference?**

State A's heavy intermediation created coordination overhead without proportionate transformation. Each intermediary reported activities to the state. None was accountable for outcomes. Information flowed from providers to intermediaries, from intermediaries to the state, and back, creating delays and filtering that obscured ground truth. The intermediary ecosystem became self-referential, with organizations coordinating with each other, attending each other's meetings, and producing joint reports, while providers struggled with implementation challenges that intermediary activity metrics did not capture.

State B's minimal intermediation concentrated resources on direct transformation support. Without intermediary layers, the state maintained visibility into implementation challenges that providers faced daily. When problems emerged, state staff could engage directly rather than waiting for intermediary communication. Competitive procurement attracted expertise matched to specific needs rather than general-purpose capacity that might or might not fit specific challenges.

**The Lesson:**

More intermediation does not necessarily produce more transformation. The relationship between intermediary investment and transformation outcomes is not linear. Some intermediary involvement may be essential, particularly for functions requiring relationships that states genuinely cannot replicate. But extensive intermediary involvement may subtract value through overhead absorption and accountability diffusion.

The question is not whether to involve intermediaries but which functions genuinely require intermediary involvement and which are better served through direct relationships or competitive procurement. Blanket intermediary strategies, whether heavily intermediated or minimally intermediated, miss the nuance that effective transformation requires.

## The Honest Assessment

Intermediaries are neither universally helpful nor universally harmful. The romanticized view that intermediaries represent essential infrastructure oversimplifies a complex reality. The cynical view that intermediaries merely extract rent also oversimplifies. The honest view requires nuanced assessment:

**Function Fit:** Some functions suit intermediary involvement; others do not. Network development among competing providers may require neutral intermediary facilitation. Direct technical assistance may be more effective through state contracts with specialized vendors. Matching functions to appropriate delivery mechanisms matters more than blanket intermediary involvement or exclusion.

**Organizational Quality:** Enormous variation exists within each intermediary type. The best PCAs deliver sophisticated transformation support that states cannot replicate. The weakest PCAs provide legitimacy cover for inadequate capacity. Treating all organizations within a category as equivalent ignores variation that determines effectiveness.

**Accountability Structure:** Whether incentives align with transformation determines whether intermediary involvement helps or hinders. Outcome-based accountability with independent verification can align intermediary incentives with transformation goals. Activity-based reporting without outcome accountability enables rent-seeking regardless of organizational intentions.

**State Capacity:** Whether alternatives to intermediaries exist shapes appropriate intermediary reliance. States with robust agency capacity and competitive provider markets can rely less on intermediaries. States with limited capacity and thin markets may require intermediary involvement despite its limitations.

**Community Voice:** Whether affected populations have influence determines whether intermediary involvement serves communities or providers. Governance structures that give communities actual power can align intermediary action with community priorities. Advisory structures without decision authority provide participation without influence.

## Recommendations

### For State Agencies

**Assess intermediary value function by function, not organization by organization.** A hospital association may add value for network development while subtracting value for technical assistance. Evaluate each proposed intermediary function against alternatives rather than accepting or rejecting organizations wholesale.

**Require transformation outcomes, not activity metrics.** Webinars conducted and technical assistance sessions delivered tell states what intermediaries did. Outcome metrics tell states what intermediaries accomplished. Accountability should flow from outcomes, not activities.

**Maintain direct relationships alongside intermediary channels.** Direct state-provider relationships provide information that intermediary-filtered reporting may obscure. States relying entirely on intermediary channels lose visibility into implementation reality.

**Build evaluation capacity independent of intermediary self-reporting.** Intermediaries reporting on their own effectiveness face obvious conflicts. Independent evaluation enables honest assessment of intermediary contribution.

**Address the community accountability gap in governance requirements.** Advisory committees do not give communities power. Require governance structures that include community members with decision authority, not just participation opportunities.

**Plan for post-2030 intermediary sustainability.** Intermediaries building capacity during RHTP implementation may not survive funding conclusion. States should assess whether intermediary-dependent transformation can sustain without ongoing intermediary involvement.

### For Intermediary Organizations

**Acknowledge when member interests and transformation goals conflict.** Pretending alignment when it does not exist erodes credibility. Honest acknowledgment of tensions enables productive navigation.

**Demonstrate value-add beyond what states could provide directly.** If states could deliver the same support through direct contracts, intermediary overhead is not justified. Intermediaries should articulate specific value that their relationships, expertise, or infrastructure uniquely enable.

**Operate transparently about overhead and outcomes.** Opacity about resource allocation invites suspicion. Transparency about overhead percentages and outcome metrics demonstrates accountability.

**Accept outcome accountability, not just activity reporting.** Resistance to outcome measurement suggests uncertainty about outcome delivery. Willingness to be held accountable for transformation results demonstrates confidence in contribution.

**Build sustainable models that do not require perpetuating problems.** Business models dependent on ongoing rural health challenges create perverse incentives. Organizations that succeed by eventually becoming unnecessary demonstrate transformation alignment.

### For CMS

**Monitor intermediary overhead across states.** National visibility into intermediary overhead patterns enables identification of outliers and best practices. States channeling excessive resources through intermediaries without proportionate outcomes should face scrutiny.

**Require outcome evidence, not just participation documentation.** Federal oversight focused on stakeholder engagement counts without transformation outcome assessment enables coordination theater. CMS should require evidence that stakeholder engagement produced transformation, not just participation.

**Support direct-to-provider channels as alternatives.** Federal programs enabling direct relationships with rural providers create alternatives to intermediary-dependent state approaches. These alternatives discipline intermediary performance through competition.

**Fund community voice in intermediary governance.** Community participation requires resources. Community members cannot participate on equal footing with professional stakeholders without compensation, support services, and capacity building. Federal investment in community governance capacity enables authentic participation.

**Enable state flexibility while maintaining accountability.** States face different circumstances requiring different intermediary strategies. Federal guidance should enable flexibility in intermediary approaches while maintaining accountability for transformation outcomes regardless of chosen approach.

## Transition to Series 7

Series 6 examined intermediaries from the state agency perspective: which organizations exist, what roles they play, and whether their involvement helps or hinders transformation. Series 7 shifts perspective to healthcare providers: how do hospitals, health centers, and clinics experience RHTP implementation?

The provider perspective will test whether intermediary value perceived at the state level translates to value experienced at the community level. Hospital associations may appear valuable from state vantage points while delivering inadequate support from hospital perspectives. PCAs may seem essential to state agencies while frustrating health centers with capacity limitations.

This perspective shift matters because **transformation ultimately occurs at the provider and community level**. State agency assessments of intermediary value are necessary but not sufficient. Provider experience provides the ground truth against which intermediary claims must be evaluated.

Series 7 will examine:
- **7A: Critical Access Hospitals** and their experience with hospital association intermediation
- **7B: Rural Health Clinics** and their relationships with state support structures
- **7C: FQHCs** and their experience with PCA intermediation
- **7D: Independent Practices** and their access to transformation support
- **7E: Specialty and Behavioral Health** provider integration challenges
- **7F: EMS and Emergency Systems** coordination across rural regions

Together with Series 6, these provider perspectives will enable comprehensive assessment of whether the intermediary infrastructure states are building actually serves the providers and communities transformation is meant to benefit.
