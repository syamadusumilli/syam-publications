# Technical Document 3-TD-E
## SDOH/HRSN/CHW/CIE State Analysis

*Series 3: State Implementation*
*Rural Health Transformation Project*
*Version 3: January 2026*

## Purpose

This technical document provides **cross-cutting analysis of social care integration** across all 50 states under the Rural Health Transformation Program. The document serves three functions:

1. **Inventory what states proposed** for SDOH screening, HRSN navigation, CHW deployment, and CIE platforms
2. **Assess what survived** partial funding decisions and implementation prioritization
3. **Identify vendor landscape gaps** and procurement opportunities for technology providers and intermediaries

Social care components rank among the **most vulnerable RHTP elements**. Rural hospital CEOs consistently rank social determinants work around 15th on priority lists, behind workforce, technology, and operational concerns. This document tracks which states protected social care investment and which allowed these components to erode under budget pressure.

## Analytical Framework

**Key Definitions**

**SDOH (Social Determinants of Health):** The conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live, and age that shape health outcomes. Includes economic stability, education, social and community context, health care access, and neighborhood/built environment.

**HRSN (Health-Related Social Needs):** The individual-level social needs affecting a patient's health, such as food insecurity, housing instability, transportation barriers, and utility difficulties. HRSN work involves screening for these needs and connecting patients to resources.

**CHW (Community Health Worker):** A frontline public health worker who is a trusted member of the community served. CHWs serve as liaisons between health services and the community, providing culturally appropriate health education, informal counseling, social support, and advocacy.

**CIE (Community Information Exchange):** A network of multidisciplinary organizations that use a shared technology platform to collaborate on social care referrals. CIE enables closed-loop referrals where the outcome of a referral is tracked and reported back to the referring organization.

**Assessment Categories**

| Category | Definition |
|----------|------------|
| **Funded** | Social care components clearly preserved with dedicated budget lines |
| **Partial** | Some components funded, others reduced or deprioritized |
| **At Risk** | Included in application but vulnerable to implementation cuts |
| **Cut** | Explicitly removed or defunded post-award |
| **Embedded** | Social care included within other initiatives without dedicated funding |
| **Unknown** | Insufficient public documentation to assess |

## Section 4: Funding Triage Analysis

### Methodology

This section compares application requests (where available) to award amounts and assesses which social care components survived funding decisions. Analysis draws from:

1. Public CMS award announcements
2. State application summaries and budget narratives
3. Post-award communications from state agencies
4. News coverage of implementation priorities

**Limitation:** Many states have not released detailed budget breakdowns post-award. This analysis represents best available information as of January 2026.

### Priority States: Social Care Survival Assessment

| State | Total Award | Social Care Status | Key Components Preserved | Components Cut/At Risk |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| **Texas** | $281M | **Partial** | SDOH screening (embedded), CHW deployment | CIE platform, closed-loop referrals |
| **California** | $234M | **At Risk** | SDOH screening (CalAIM), CHW (priority regions) | Full CIE deployment, regional coverage |
| **Mississippi** | $206M | **Uncertain** | Unknown | All social care components status unclear |
| **Ohio** | $202M | **At Risk** | Pathways HUB (existing) | No dedicated SDOH investment |
| **Georgia** | $219M | **Cut** | None | SDOH, CHW, CIE all absent from plan |
| **Tennessee** | $207M | **Funded** | TN Community Compass, CHW, navigation | Minor scope reductions possible |
| **Kentucky** | $213M | **Funded** | Chronic care hubs, CHW, 211 integration | Full deployment uncertain |
| **Alabama** | $203M | **At Risk** | Embedded in CRIS | Standalone infrastructure absent |
| **Arkansas** | $209M | **Unknown** | Unknown | Unknown |
| **North Carolina** | $213M | **Funded** | NCCARE360, CHW, hub-based navigation | HOP continuation uncertain |
| **Oklahoma** | $223M | **Partial** | CHW (tribal), MCO SDOH | Statewide coordination |
| **West Virginia** | $199M | **Funded** | CHW expansion, findhelp integration | Statewide CIE coverage |

### Social Care Prioritization Patterns

**States with Strong Social Care Protection**

| State | Evidence of Protection | Key Factor |
|-------|----------------------|------------|
| Tennessee | Existing TN Community Compass, dedicated funding | Pre-existing infrastructure |
| North Carolina | NCCARE360 operational, hub model includes SDOH | Platform maturity |
| Oregon | CCO mandate for social care, Unite Us deployed | Medicaid integration |
| Wisconsin | CHW Medicaid SPA pathway, 211 investment | Sustainability planning |
| West Virginia | CHW expansion central to strategy | Academic partnerships |
| Kentucky | Chronic care hubs include navigation | Hub design requirement |

**States with Weak or Absent Social Care Investment**

| State | Evidence of Weak Investment | Consequence |
|-------|---------------------------|-------------|
| Georgia | No SDOH, CHW, or CIE in plan | Complete gap |
| Texas | Data capture without service delivery | Screening without resolution |
| Ohio | Fragmented platforms, no coordination | Persistent siloing |
| Mississippi | Absence from public documentation | Status unknown |

### Correlation with Medicaid Expansion Status

| Expansion Status | States with Strong SDOH | States with Weak SDOH | Pattern |
|------------------|------------------------|----------------------|---------|
| **Expansion states** | NC, OR, WA, KY, WV | OH | Strong positive correlation |
| **Non-expansion states** | TN (exception) | TX, GA, MS, AL | Negative correlation |

**Interpretation:** Medicaid expansion states show **stronger social care integration** overall. The Tennessee exception (non-expansion with strong social care) reflects pre-existing TennCare infrastructure and deliberate state investment. Non-expansion states generally prioritize clinical infrastructure over social care, reflecting both philosophy and resource constraints.

## Section 5: Technology Vendor Landscape

### Market Structure Analysis

**Tier 1: National CIE Platforms**

| Vendor | 2025 Valuation | State Contracts | RHTP Positioning | Rural Capability |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Unite Us** | $1.6B+ | 43+ states | Strong | Moderate (urban origin) |
| **Findhelp** | $200M+ (est.) | National directory, ~10 state contracts | Strong | Stronger rural presence |
| **NobleSG** | Private | Limited (MT, tribal) | Emerging | Strong (government focus) |

**Tier 2: Specialized Platforms**

| Vendor | Focus Area | State Presence | RHTP Opportunity |
|--------|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| **Healthify** | MCO integration | Multi-state via MCOs | Moderate |
| **NowPow** | Food/pharmacy referrals | Limited | Niche |
| **Aunt Bertha** (Findhelp legacy) | Resource directory | National | Baseline offering |
| **Epic Social Care** | EHR-embedded | Via Epic hospitals | Limited standalone |
| **Cerner Social Determinants** | EHR-embedded | Via Cerner hospitals | Limited standalone |

**Tier 3: Regional and State-Specific**

| Platform | Geography | Operator | Notes |
|----------|-----------|----------|-------|
| **NCCARE360** | North Carolina | FHLI + Unite Us | Branded statewide deployment |
| **Connect Oregon** | Oregon | CCO consortium + Unite Us | CCO-mediated |
| **Tennessee Community Compass** | Tennessee | TennCare + Findhelp | State-branded |
| **CONNECT** | Montana | DPHHS + NobleSG | State-operated |
| **Unite Iowa** | Iowa | IHIN + Unite Us | HIE partnership |

### Procurement Pipeline Analysis

**Active or Anticipated Procurements**

| State | Procurement Focus | Expected Timeline | Incumbent | Open Competition |
|-------|------------------|-------------------|-----------|------------------|
| **California** | Regional CIE platforms | Q3 2026 | Varies by region | Yes |
| **Washington** | Statewide CIE | Summer 2026 | None | Yes |
| **Vermont** | Closed-loop referral | 2026 | None | Yes |
| **Alabama** | Unknown | Unknown | None | Unknown |

**States with No Active Procurement**

Texas, Ohio, Georgia, Mississippi, and several other states show **no active CIE procurement** despite significant rural populations. This creates market gaps for vendors but also reflects deliberate deprioritization of social care technology.

### Vendor Gap Assessment by State

| Gap Category | States | Opportunity Description |
|--------------|--------|------------------------|
| **No statewide CIE** | TX, OH, GA, MS | Greenfield deployment opportunity |
| **Fragmented regional** | CA | Platform consolidation or interoperability |
| **State-operated seeking upgrade** | MT | Technology enhancement partnership |
| **Procurement pending** | WA, VT | Active sales opportunity |
| **Minimal rural penetration** | Multiple | Rural workflow adaptation |

### Rural-Specific Technology Gaps

Most CIE platforms were designed for **urban healthcare environments** with dense provider networks and robust CBO infrastructure. Rural deployments face distinct challenges:

| Challenge | Impact | Vendor Response Required |
|-----------|--------|-------------------------|
| **Sparse CBO networks** | Nothing to refer to in many rural areas | Resource creation, not just coordination |
| **Connectivity limitations** | Platforms require reliable internet | Offline-capable applications |
| **Provider EHR variation** | Small rural providers use diverse systems | Broader integration portfolio |
| **Distance and transportation** | Service delivery models differ | Mobile-first workflows |
| **Workforce for navigation** | Limited staff for platform use | Simplified interfaces, CHW focus |

**Vendor Adaptation Status**

| Vendor | Rural Adaptation | Evidence |
|--------|-----------------|----------|
| Unite Us | Moderate | Some rural deployments, but urban-centric design |
| Findhelp | Stronger | Resource directory covers rural areas, simpler interface |
| NobleSG | Strong | Government and rural focus by design |
| Epic/Cerner | Weak | Hospital-centric, limited small-provider reach |

## Section 6: Cross-State Patterns

| **Platform licensing** | Ongoing vendor fees | States with new procurements |
| **CBO capacity** | Referral volume exceeds service capacity | All states |

## Section 7: Strategic Implications

### For State Agencies

**Successful Social Care Integration Models**

States achieving strong social care integration share common characteristics:

1. **Pre-existing infrastructure** that RHTP supplements rather than creates
2. **Platform maturity** reducing implementation risk
3. **Sustainability pathways** identified before program launch
4. **CHW employer infrastructure** ensuring trained workers have jobs

**Common Pitfalls**

| Pitfall | Description | States Demonstrating |
|---------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Screening without services** | Identifying needs without resolution capacity | TX |
| **Technology without adoption** | Platforms deployed but not used | Emerging risk multiple states |
| **Training without employment** | CHW pipeline without employer absorption | CA (regional variation) |
| **Platform without CBO capacity** | Referral systems pointing to nonexistent services | Rural areas all states |

**Recommended Approaches**

1. **Leverage existing infrastructure** rather than procuring new platforms
2. **Ensure CHW employer commitment** before scaling training programs
3. **Plan sustainability mechanisms** (Medicaid reimbursement, MCO contracts) from program launch
4. **Accept geographic limitations** where CBO infrastructure cannot support referral models

### For Intermediary Organizations

**CHW Deployment Opportunities**

| Opportunity Type | States | Role for Intermediaries |
|------------------|--------|------------------------|
| **Training pipeline operation** | TX, NC, CA, WI | Deliver certified CHW training |
| **Employment infrastructure** | All states with CHW programs | Serve as CHW employer with provider contracts |
| **Supervision provision** | States without clinical integration | Provide required clinical oversight |
| **Quality assurance** | TN, NC (accreditation models) | Certification and standards enforcement |

**CIE Platform Partnership Models**

| Model | Description | Intermediary Role |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Platform operator** | State contracts intermediary to run CIE | Direct operational responsibility |
| **Onboarding lead** | Intermediary recruits CBOs to platform | Network development |
| **Integration support** | Intermediary assists provider connections | Technical assistance |
| **Resource directory maintenance** | Intermediary keeps CBO information current | Ongoing operational support |

### For Technology Vendors

**Market Entry Opportunities**

| Opportunity | States | Timeline | Competition Level |
|-------------|--------|----------|-------------------|
| **Greenfield statewide CIE** | TX, OH, GA | Unknown (no active procurement) | Low (but no demand) |
| **Active procurement** | WA, VT | 2026 | Moderate |
| **Regional consolidation** | CA | 2026 | High |
| **Platform enhancement** | MT, IA, WI | Ongoing | Low (incumbent advantage) |

**Rural Market Requirements**

Vendors seeking rural RHTP contracts must address:

1. **Offline capability** for areas with unreliable connectivity
2. **Simplified interfaces** for providers with limited IT staff
3. **Flexible integration** with diverse small-provider EHR systems
4. **Resource creation tools** where CBO networks are sparse
5. **Mobile-first design** for CHW deployment in field settings

**Competitive Positioning**

| Positioning Strategy | Target States | Key Differentiator |
|---------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Rural specialization** | Frontier states (MT, WY, AK) | Geography-appropriate design |
| **Medicaid integration** | Expansion states | Billing and reporting capability |
| **CHW workflow focus** | States with CHW emphasis (WV, KY) | Navigation-centric rather than referral-centric |
| **Cost leadership** | Budget-constrained states | Lower licensing and implementation fees |

## Appendix A: Data Sources and Methodology

### Primary Sources

**State RHTP Applications:** Where publicly available, state applications provide proposed initiative details, budget breakdowns, and social care component specifications. Availability varies significantly by state.

**CMS Announcements:** CMS award announcements (December 29, 2025) provide total award figures but limited initiative-level detail.

**State Health Department Materials:** Post-award communications, implementation planning documents, and stakeholder presentations provide insight into prioritization decisions.

**Vendor Announcements:** Platform vendors announce state deployments and contract awards, providing visibility into CIE landscape.

**News Coverage:** Regional and healthcare trade press coverage of state RHTP activities supplements official documentation.

### Methodology Limitations

1. **Information asymmetry:** States differ dramatically in public documentation availability
2. **Timing:** Post-award implementation decisions ongoing; assessment reflects January 2026 status
3. **Embedded versus distinct:** Difficulty distinguishing genuinely funded social care from nominal inclusion
4. **Vendor reporting:** Platform presence does not indicate RHTP funding or rural deployment

### Data Currency

This document reflects information available as of **January 21, 2026**. State implementation decisions continue evolving. Updates anticipated as:

1. States release detailed implementation plans
2. Procurement decisions conclude
3. Year 1 performance reporting becomes available
4. Vendor announcements clarify deployment status
