# RHTP 3.NY: New York

**A State of Contrasts: Strong Safety Net, Real Rural Crisis**

## Introduction

New York received **$212,058,208** in first-year RHTP funding, announced December 29, 2025. This positions the state 13th nationally in total award size, squarely in the middle tier of allocations despite maintaining the **11th largest rural population** in the nation at approximately 1.7 million residents.

The per capita figure tells a more revealing story. At roughly **$125 per rural resident annually**, New York's allocation exceeds the national median but falls well below frontier states benefiting from the formula's geographic weighting. Wyoming, Montana, and Alaska receive between $300 and $500 per rural resident. Texas, with its massive rural population, receives only $60. New York occupies the uncomfortable middle ground: receiving adequate but not generous funding for a state where rural challenges are genuine but less politically salient than in states where rural populations dominate the electorate.

**The central paradox** shaping New York's RHTP implementation is straightforward: the state possesses among the nation's most comprehensive Medicaid programs and strongest overall healthcare infrastructure, yet its rural communities face workforce shortages, hospital financial stress, and health outcome disparities comparable to states with far weaker safety nets. State resources buffer the worst outcomes, but they cannot eliminate the fundamental challenge of delivering healthcare across vast distances to aging, economically stressed populations.

## Rural Health Landscape

**Defining Rural New York**

New York's rural population of 1.7 million represents only **8.7% of state residents**, ranking 46th nationally in rural percentage. This statistical reality explains why rural health rarely dominates Albany's policy agenda. Rural New Yorkers are outnumbered and politically marginalized within a state whose economic and cultural identity centers on its metropolitan regions.

Yet 1.7 million people exceeds the entire population of 11 U.S. states. Rural New York encompasses **over 40,000 square miles**, an area larger than Kentucky. The distances involved create genuine access challenges that state policy frameworks designed around metropolitan density struggle to address.

**Regional Variation**

Rural New York divides into distinct regions, each presenting unique health system challenges:

| Region | Characteristics | Key Counties |
|--------|-----------------|--------------|
| North Country | Border region, extreme winters, tourism and military economy | St. Lawrence, Franklin, Essex, Jefferson |
| Southern Tier | Manufacturing decline, Appalachian extension, aging population | Chenango, Delaware, Schuyler, Tioga, Broome |
| Finger Lakes Rural | Agricultural economy, winery tourism, seasonal workforce | Yates, Schuyler, Seneca, Ontario |
| Catskills | Resort decline, second-home economy, aging in place | Sullivan, Greene, Delaware, Ulster |
| Western NY Rural | Dairy economy, population decline, Native American reservations | Allegany, Cattaraugus, Wyoming, Chautauqua |

The **Southern Tier** represents the northernmost extension of Appalachian culture and economy. These counties share characteristics with Appalachian Kentucky and West Virginia: persistent manufacturing decline, population aging, opioid challenges, and cultural distance from state power centers. The region has experienced decades of economic contraction as employers like IBM, Endicott-Johnson, and other manufacturers departed.

The **North Country** faces different challenges: extreme isolation, border proximity complicating healthcare access patterns, and an economy split between military installations, tourism, and declining agricultural operations. Fort Drum's presence in Jefferson County creates demographic anomalies that complicate health planning.

**Healthcare Infrastructure Inventory**

Rural New York maintains a healthcare infrastructure that appears robust on paper but operates under significant stress:

| Facility Type | Count | Distribution |
|---------------|-------|--------------|
| Critical Access Hospitals | 21 | Concentrated in North Country and Southern Tier |
| Rural Health Clinics | 47 | Distributed across rural counties |
| FQHCs and Look-Alikes | 64 sites | Serving rural and underserved populations |
| Sole Community Hospitals | 12 | Serving isolated populations |
| Rural Health Networks | 31 | State-designated coordination entities |

**Wyoming County Community Health System** received Critical Access Hospital designation in May 2024, converting from standard acute care status to access cost-based Medicare reimbursement projected to generate approximately $3 million in additional annual revenue. This conversion illustrates the financial pressure driving rural facilities to restructure under more favorable payment models.

**Cobleskill Regional Hospital**, part of Bassett Healthcare Network, was named among the **top 100 Critical Access Hospitals nationally** in 2024 by the Chartis Center for Rural Health, the only New York facility to receive this recognition. The award reflects both the hospital's performance and the relatively small number of high-performing CAHs in the state.

**Hospital Financial Stress**

The financial condition of New York's rural hospitals is deteriorating despite Medicaid expansion and state support programs. According to analysis from the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform, **over one-third of rural New York hospitals are at immediate risk of closure**. Additional findings paint a concerning picture:

**62% of rural hospitals** in New York reported financial losses in 2023-2024, even with Medicaid funding intact. Six rural hospitals rank in the **top 10% nationally** for Medicaid payer mix, making them acutely vulnerable to federal Medicaid cuts. Five additional hospitals have experienced **three consecutive years of negative margins**, indicating chronic financial distress rather than temporary setbacks.

State legislation introduced in 2025 (Senate Bill S2633) noted that **21 rural New York hospitals face immediate closure risk**, characterizing the situation as an "undeclared healthcare emergency." The bill proposed creating "distressed healthcare zones" to prioritize resource allocation, though its passage remains uncertain.

**Workforce Shortages**

New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli's August 2025 audit documented severe workforce shortages across 16 rural counties examined:

| Metric | Rural NY Average | State Average | National Average |
|--------|------------------|---------------|------------------|
| Primary Care Physicians per 10,000 | 4.0 | 8.1 | 8.4 |
| GMENAC Guideline | 6.9 | N/A | N/A |

**Ten of the sixteen rural counties** examined are federally designated as Health Professional Shortage Areas for primary care, dental, and mental health. All 16 counties carry shortage designations for at least two medical disciplines.

The limited number of providers and physical facilities creates a **self-reinforcing recruitment challenge**. Young physicians choosing practice locations see rural counties lacking peers, specialty backup, and career advancement opportunities. Hospitals operating on tight margins cannot offer competitive salaries or signing bonuses. The cycle continues.

**Health Outcomes Snapshot**

Rural New Yorkers experience measurable health disparities relative to their urban counterparts. Natural-cause mortality runs higher in rural counties, with the disparity widening over recent years. CDC analysis in 2024 noted that rural residents nationwide "tend to be sicker and poorer and to have worse health outcomes than do their non-rural peers." New York reflects this national pattern despite its stronger overall healthcare system.

## RHTP Award and Context

**Funding Details**

| Component | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| FY2026 Allocation | $212,058,208 |
| Equal Distribution Baseline | $100,000,000 |
| Workload Funding Component | $112,058,208 |
| Five-Year Projection (if maintained) | ~$1.06 billion |
| Per Rural Resident (annual) | ~$125 |
| National Ranking | 13th |

New York's **$112 million workload funding component** suggests moderate technical score performance, neither exceptionally strong nor notably weak. The state's limited geographic vastness and relatively robust existing infrastructure reduced competitiveness for discretionary allocation compared to states with more severe baseline conditions.

**Medicaid Context**

New York **expanded Medicaid in 2014** under the Affordable Care Act, among the earliest states to do so. The state's Medicaid program covers approximately **7.5 million residents**, among the largest enrollments nationally. The **Essential Plan** provides additional coverage for individuals above Medicaid income limits but below marketplace affordability thresholds, creating one of the nation's most comprehensive public coverage systems.

In the 16 rural counties examined by the Comptroller's office, **204,899 people (27% of the population)** were enrolled in Medicaid as of May 2025. Rural Medicaid dependence runs high, making federal cuts to the program particularly threatening to rural healthcare sustainability.

**The Medicaid Math Problem**

New York faces among the **largest absolute Medicaid gaps** between RHTP investment and projected federal Medicaid cuts under H.R. 1. Penn LDI analysis identified New York alongside California, Pennsylvania, and Illinois as states where RHTP allocations cannot meaningfully offset annualized federal Medicaid spending reductions.

The arithmetic is stark: New York's $212 million annual RHTP allocation represents a fraction of projected Medicaid cuts. RHTP funding cannot legally backfill lost Medicaid revenue, cannot be used for direct hospital operating support, and cannot address the coverage losses that will reduce insured patient volumes at rural facilities already operating on negative margins.

Six rural hospitals ranking in the **top 10% nationally for Medicaid payer mix** face acute vulnerability. These facilities depend on Medicaid for revenue disproportionately; federal cuts will reduce their income regardless of how RHTP funds are deployed.

## State Approach

**Lead Agency and Governance**

The **New York State Department of Health** serves as lead agency, with Commissioner James V. McDonald, M.D., M.P.H., coordinating implementation. The December 30, 2025 press release indicated the Department would "work with CMS to finalize the details of the cooperative agreement" before providing stakeholder details on resource allocation and funding opportunities.

New York's governance approach layers RHTP resources across existing departmental authorities rather than creating new implementation structures. The state's 31 designated **rural health networks** will serve as regional coordination entities, building on infrastructure established through previous state rural health initiatives.

**Strategic Framework: Four Key Initiatives**

New York's Rural Health Transformation Plan, developed with input from **nearly 170 stakeholder organizations**, centers on four integrated initiatives:

**Initiative 1: Coordinated Rural Health Partnerships**

This initiative creates partnerships between rural hospitals and healthcare organizations to **enhance patient access across the care continuum**. The design recognizes that rural residents often must travel to multiple facilities for different services; coordinated partnerships reduce fragmentation and improve navigation.

The initiative addresses **both health and social needs**, explicitly incorporating social determinants of health into care coordination frameworks. Implementation will require defining partnership structures, establishing data-sharing agreements, and creating accountability mechanisms for coordinated care delivery.

**Initiative 2: Technology-Enhanced Primary Care**

New York proposes strengthening rural patient access through the **Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) model** with incorporated artificial intelligence capabilities. The initiative targets improved utilization of high-quality primary care, recognizing that rural residents underutilize preventive services relative to their disease burden.

Technology enhancement includes telehealth expansion, remote patient monitoring, and AI-assisted clinical decision support. The initiative acknowledges that technology adoption requires infrastructure investment, training, and workflow redesign, not merely equipment procurement.

**Initiative 3: Sustainable Rural Health Workforce**

The workforce initiative aims to create a **self-sustaining cycle of workforce development** addressing both immediate staffing needs and long-term capacity building. The framing explicitly acknowledges that one-time recruitment interventions fail without pipeline development.

Components include loan forgiveness programs, rural training rotations, and career advancement pathways designed to retain workers after initial recruitment. The state's existing **Doctors Across New York** loan repayment program and **Regents Physician Loan Forgiveness Program** provide foundations for expansion.

Within New York in 2024, **18 residency programs** offered rural rotations (two receiving federal Rural Residency Planning and Development funding), and **five Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education programs** trained primary care physicians who enter rural practice at higher rates than other graduates. More than 27% of physicians completing THCGME programs in New York reported initial practice positions in rural areas.

**Initiative 4: Technology Innovation and Cybersecurity**

The fourth initiative addresses infrastructure modernization through telehealth expansion, eConsult partnerships, health information technology upgrades, and **cybersecurity enhancements** for rural facilities. Rural hospitals face heightened cybersecurity vulnerability due to limited IT staff and aging systems; several rural facilities nationally have experienced ransomware attacks disrupting care delivery.

The initiative includes expanding "usable alerts" in rural counties, referring to clinical decision support notifications integrated into electronic health records to prompt appropriate care interventions.

**Program and Funding Distribution**

At press time, New York had not released detailed program allocation tables or subawardee registries. The state indicated that once cooperative agreement details are finalized, "additional details to interested stakeholders around the allocation of resources and funding opportunities" would follow.

| Program Area | Estimated Allocation | Implementing Organization | Status |
|--------------|---------------------|---------------------------|--------|
| Coordinated Partnerships | TBD | Rural Health Networks, Hospitals | Pending |
| Technology-Enhanced Primary Care | TBD | FQHCs, Primary Care Practices | Pending |
| Workforce Development | TBD | DOH, Academic Medical Centers | Pending |
| Technology/Cybersecurity | TBD | Hospitals, Health Systems | Pending |
| Administration | ~5-10% | DOH | Standard |

New York's funding distribution process will "**prioritize the identified needs of rural populations**" according to the December 2025 announcement. Program implementation will include "ongoing stakeholder engagement, including feedback from providers, tribal and faith-based organizations, local leaders and community members."

**Key Stakeholders**

New York's application documents engagement with nearly 170 stakeholder organizations, though specific partnership agreements and subaward structures remain unpublished:

| Organization Type | Role | RHTP Involvement |
|-------------------|------|------------------|
| Healthcare Association of New York State (HANYS) | Hospital association | Technical assistance, network coordination |
| Community Health Care Association of NYS (CHCANYS) | FQHC association | Primary care delivery, workforce |
| Rural Health Networks (31) | Regional coordinators | Local implementation, community engagement |
| SUNY Upstate, UB, other academic centers | Academic partners | Workforce training, telehealth hubs |
| Bassett Healthcare Network | Rural health system | Service delivery, CAH network |

## Social Care Integration

**SDOH/HRSN Initiatives**

New York's plan explicitly incorporates **health-related social needs** within the Coordinated Rural Health Partnerships initiative. The state's existing infrastructure for social care integration provides foundation for RHTP expansion:

| Component | Included in Plan | Funding | Vendor/Operator | Likely Funded? |
|-----------|------------------|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| SDOH Screening | Yes (implicit) | TBD | Provider partners | At Risk |
| HRSN Navigation | Yes | TBD | Rural Health Networks | At Risk |
| CHW Programs | Unclear | TBD | Unknown | At Risk |
| CIE Platform | Unclear | TBD | Unknown | Unknown |

New York's **Value Based Payment Roadmap** already requires managed care plans to screen members for social needs and connect them to resources. RHTP implementation can build on this foundation by extending social care integration to rural fee-for-service populations and strengthening referral infrastructure.

**Community Health Worker Programs**

The application documents do not explicitly detail CHW deployment targets or funding allocations. New York operates existing CHW programs through various funding streams, but whether RHTP will support rural CHW expansion remains unclear pending cooperative agreement finalization.

**Technology Vendor Landscape**

New York's social care referral technology landscape includes multiple platforms operating in different regions:

| Platform | Coverage | RHTP Integration Status |
|----------|----------|------------------------|
| Unite Us | Available statewide | Unknown |
| 211 System | Statewide | Potential integration |
| Regional HIEs | Variable | Potential data sharing |

The state has not announced CIE platform procurement or mandated interoperability requirements for RHTP-funded programs.

## Assessment

**Strengths of Approach**

New York's RHTP strategy benefits from several advantages:

**Existing Infrastructure** provides foundation rather than requiring greenfield development. The 31 rural health networks, established workforce programs, and comprehensive Medicaid coverage create platforms for RHTP deployment. States without such infrastructure face longer implementation timelines and higher coordination costs.

**Stakeholder Engagement** of 170 organizations during application development suggests broad buy-in for implementation. Whether this translates to effective partnership during execution remains to be demonstrated, but the consultation process reduces risk of overlooking critical implementation challenges.

**Integrated Initiative Design** connecting workforce, technology, partnerships, and primary care enhancement reflects understanding that rural health transformation requires coordinated intervention rather than isolated programs. The risk of disconnected initiatives competing for attention and resources appears lower than in states with more fragmented approaches.

**Vulnerabilities**

**Medicaid Cut Exposure** represents the dominant vulnerability. Rural hospitals already operating at negative margins face revenue reductions that RHTP funding cannot offset. The transformation program addresses access and quality; it cannot solve the fundamental payment adequacy problem that federal Medicaid cuts will exacerbate.

**Implementation Timeline Pressure** creates risk of rushed deployment. States must obligate funds within two years, a requirement that incentivizes speed over sustainability. New York's cautious approach of finalizing cooperative agreements before announcing allocation details suggests awareness of this risk, but timeline pressure will eventually force decisions.

**Political Marginalization** of rural interests within New York governance poses ongoing challenge. Rural populations represent under 9% of state residents; their concerns rarely dominate Albany's policy agenda. Sustaining investment and attention beyond RHTP's five-year window will require political coalition-building that the state's demographic reality makes difficult.

**Low Visibility** compared to priority states receiving three-part treatment means New York's RHTP implementation will attract less external scrutiny and documentation. This reduces both accountability pressure and learning opportunities from detailed analysis.

**Sustainability Prospects**

The 2030 question looms over all RHTP implementation. When federal funding expires, what survives?

New York's **Essential Plan and expanded Medicaid** provide baseline coverage that many states lack, improving post-RHTP sustainability prospects. Workforce pipeline investments may generate returns extending beyond the program period. Technology infrastructure, once deployed, may persist without ongoing federal support.

However, **social care integration components** face highest sustainability risk. Screening, navigation, and coordination services require ongoing operational funding that state general funds may not provide. If federal Medicaid cuts proceed as projected, state budget capacity to sustain RHTP-initiated programs will be further constrained.

**Critical Success Factors**

New York's RHTP success depends on:

**Rapid Cooperative Agreement Finalization** enabling fund distribution before implementation timeline pressure forces suboptimal decisions.

**Effective Subawardee Selection** ensuring funds reach organizations with implementation capacity rather than merely grant-writing sophistication.

**Workforce Pipeline Investments** producing returns within the five-year program window, demonstrating value that justifies sustained commitment.

**Social Care Integration Survival** through either state commitment to ongoing funding or payer adoption of SDOH-related payment mechanisms.

## Conclusion

New York enters RHTP implementation from a position of relative strength that masks genuine rural vulnerability. The state's comprehensive coverage systems, established rural health networks, and bureaucratic capacity create advantages that poorer states lack. Yet 1.7 million rural New Yorkers face workforce shortages, hospital financial stress, and access challenges that state resources have not solved.

**$212 million annually** represents meaningful investment but not transformational scale relative to the challenges documented. The per-capita allocation of $125 per rural resident provides resources for targeted interventions, not system-wide restructuring.

The state's four-initiative framework sensibly integrates workforce, technology, partnerships, and primary care enhancement. Whether implementation matches design ambition depends on factors the application cannot control: federal Medicaid cut implementation, state budget constraints, provider participation, and whether two years proves sufficient for meaningful transformation.

Rural New Yorkers deserve the same healthcare access as their metropolitan neighbors. RHTP provides resources toward that goal. Whether it provides enough resources, deployed effectively enough, over a timeline long enough, to achieve sustainable transformation remains the open question that implementation will answer.
