# RHTP 3.SC: South Carolina

*Black Belt extension without a safety net: five initiatives and 350 stakeholder proposals confronting the coverage gap.*

## Introduction

South Carolina received **$200,030,252 in RHTP funding for FY2026**, translating to roughly **$125 per rural resident** over the five-year program. The state's application, built from over 350 stakeholder proposals, organizes transformation efforts into five initiatives spanning telehealth expansion, mobile care delivery, pilot program scaling, infrastructure investment, and innovation funding.

The arithmetic appears reasonable until placed against context. South Carolina has **not expanded Medicaid**. Between 65,000 and 340,000 residents fall into the coverage gap depending on methodology, too poor for marketplace subsidies, too ineligible for existing Medicaid. Six rural hospitals have closed since 2010. Seven more face closure risk within six to seven years. RHTP funding cannot fill the structural hole that non-expansion creates. The program explicitly prohibits using funds to backfill coverage losses or provide direct care to uninsured individuals.

South Carolina's transformation plan must therefore navigate an impossible constraint: **building rural health infrastructure for populations who cannot afford to use it**.

## Rural Health Landscape

**Geographic Reality**

South Carolina's rural health crisis follows patterns familiar from Georgia and Alabama, states where the Black Belt's legacy of plantation economics and systematic disinvestment produces the nation's worst health outcomes. The difference: Georgia implemented partial Medicaid expansion in 2023. South Carolina combines **Black Belt demographics with coastal isolation** in a state that has refused every federal expansion opportunity since 2010.

**The Pee Dee Region** in northeastern South Carolina demonstrates how hospital closure cascades through rural communities. Marlboro Park Hospital in Bennettsville closed in 2015 with 94 beds. Chesterfield General Hospital survived only through merger with regional systems. The remaining hospitals serve populations traveling 30 to 60 miles for emergency care across a region where median household income falls below $35,000 in most counties.

Marion County, Dillon County, Marlboro County, and Williamsburg County form a corridor where hospital access has collapsed while poverty, chronic disease, and population age create maximum healthcare demand. Williamsburg Regional Hospital holds Critical Access Hospital designation, providing cost-based Medicare reimbursement that sustains operations, but CAH status cannot compensate for the uninsured population that walks through the door.

**The Lowcountry and Midlands** extend the Black Belt from Georgia into South Carolina's central and southern regions. Bamberg County Memorial Hospital closed in 2012. Southern Palmetto Hospital in Barnwell closed in 2016. Fairfield Memorial in Winnsboro closed in 2018. The pattern is consistent: facilities serving high-poverty populations with limited insurance coverage cannot generate revenue to sustain operations.

**Healthcare Infrastructure**

| Facility Type | Count | Notes |
|---------------|-------|-------|
| Critical Access Hospitals | 4 | Abbeville, Allendale, Edgefield, Williamsburg |
| Small Independent Hospitals | 3 | Remaining independent facilities statewide |
| Rural Hospitals (System-Affiliated) | 18 | Various health system partnerships |
| Rural Health Clinics | 85+ | Primary care access points |
| Rural FQHC Sites | 60+ | Community health center locations |

**Allendale County Hospital** stands as the sole remaining independent hospital serving approximately 30,000 people across Allendale, Barnwell, and Bamberg counties. Allendale County ranks among South Carolina's poorest counties. The hospital's administrator has stated publicly that proposed Medicaid cuts would devastate operations.

**Workforce Crisis**

| Shortage Area | Status |
|---------------|--------|
| Primary Care HPSAs | 31 of 46 counties designated |
| Mental Health HPSAs | 44 of 46 counties designated |
| Dental HPSAs | 38 of 46 counties designated |
| OB-GYN Access | Multiple counties without providers |
| Nursing Shortage | Critical across rural facilities |

The **University of South Carolina Rural Health Research Center** confirms predictable outcomes. Rural populations trend older, carry higher chronic disease burdens, and depend more heavily on Medicare and Medicaid than urban populations. When Medicaid covers only narrow eligibility categories and Medicare serves the elderly, the **working-age uninsured population falls through every safety net**.

**Coverage Gap Arithmetic**

South Carolina's Medicaid eligibility rules create the coverage gap defining its rural health crisis. Parents must earn less than **67 percent of the federal poverty level** to qualify, roughly $17,300 annually for a family of three. Adults without dependent children face complete exclusion regardless of income.

The coverage gap population, those earning too little for marketplace subsidies but categorically ineligible for Medicaid, comprises the **working poor who staff restaurants, farms, warehouses, and retail establishments** across rural South Carolina. Multiple estimates place this population between 65,000 and 340,000 people. What remains consistent: South Carolina contains one of the largest coverage gaps among non-expansion states when adjusted for population.

## RHTP Award and Context

**Funding Position**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| FY2026 Allocation | $200,030,252 |
| Baseline Component | $100,000,000 |
| Workload Component | ~$100,030,000 |
| Five-Year Projected Total | ~$1.0 billion |
| Rural Population | ~1.6 million |
| Per Rural Resident (Five-Year) | ~$125 |
| National Average | ~$164 |

South Carolina's per-capita funding falls **below national averages**, reflecting the scale penalty affecting larger rural populations. Texas and California face similar dynamics where absolute award size appears impressive but per-resident investment remains modest.

**Medicaid Context**

South Carolina is a **non-expansion state**, having declined Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act throughout its fifteen-year availability. This creates fundamental constraints on RHTP effectiveness since transformation initiatives build infrastructure for populations who cannot afford to use it.

The H.R. 1 Medicaid restructuring compounds pressure. Per-capita caps and work requirements could reduce federal matching further. Rural hospitals already absorbing uncompensated care face potential revenue erosion that RHTP cannot offset.

**Hospital Financial Vulnerability**

The Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform identifies **seven South Carolina rural hospitals at risk of closure** within six to seven years. Four face immediate risk within two to three years. This represents:

- **32 percent** of rural hospitals at general closure risk
- **18 percent** at immediate closure risk

These percentages mirror Georgia and Alabama patterns. The consistent factor: non-expansion status combined with high uncompensated care burdens.

## State Approach

**Governance Structure**

**South Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (SCDHHS)** serves as lead agency under Governor Henry McMaster's designation. Director **Robby Kerr** oversees implementation. SCDHHS administers Medicaid and brings experience managing large federal healthcare programs, though the state's non-expansion status limits that experience compared to expansion states.

Application development involved extensive stakeholder engagement generating over 350 proposals from healthcare providers, community organizations, and local officials. SCDHHS organized these proposals into five major initiatives targeting distinct transformation mechanisms. The application emphasized that rural South Carolina faces compounding challenges: hospital closures, workforce shortages, transportation barriers, and broadband limitations that make conventional care delivery models ineffective.

**Strategic Framework**

South Carolina's approach emphasizes **technology-enabled access expansion** and **mobile care delivery** as primary mechanisms, with innovation funding supporting entrepreneurial approaches to rural health challenges. The state explicitly acknowledges that not all RHTP initiatives will succeed, particularly the innovation investments that carry inherent entrepreneurial risk.

The provider-eligible model includes:
- Critical Access Hospitals and rural hospitals
- Rural Health Clinics
- Federally Qualified Health Centers
- Mobile health units
- Telehealth networks
- Community-based organizations (as partners)

The state committed to **administrative costs below 5%**, dedicating resources to direct program implementation. This positions South Carolina competitively relative to states with higher administrative allocations.

## Program Allocation Framework

South Carolina's five initiatives distribute approximately $1 billion over five years:

| Initiative | Focus | Estimated Allocation | Share |
|------------|-------|---------------------|-------|
| Connections to Care | Telehealth, health kiosks, technology | ~$250M | 25% |
| Wellness Within Reach | Mobile health units, community outreach | ~$200M | 20% |
| Strengthening What Works | Scaling existing pilot programs | ~$150M | 15% |
| Building Tomorrow | Infrastructure, facility improvements | ~$200M | 20% |
| Incubating Solutions | Innovation funding, entrepreneurial pilots | ~$200M | 20% |

*Allocations estimated from application descriptions; precise figures pending cooperative agreement finalization.*

**Initiative Details**

**Initiative 1: Connections to Care**. Health kiosks in community settings for routine screenings and automated prescription pickup. Telehealth infrastructure connecting rural patients with specialists unavailable locally. Broadband connectivity improvements for healthcare facilities. The telehealth focus addresses a real problem: rural South Carolina lacks specialists across virtually every category. Patients requiring cardiology, oncology, behavioral health, or subspecialty consultation face drives of 60 to 100 miles. Telehealth can bridge geographic distance for consultation and follow-up care, but **requires someone to pay for the visit**. For the uninsured population in the coverage gap, telehealth infrastructure creates access to services they cannot afford.

**Initiative 2: Wellness Within Reach**. Mobile health units bringing primary care, screenings, and preventive services directly to communities. Building on Clemson Rural Health's existing mobile program serving uninsured patients at free or reduced rates. The program demonstrates both potential and limitation: only about half of Clemson Rural Health patients have insurance coverage, compared to 92 percent nationally. The mobile units depend on $2.5 million in annual state contract funding from SCDHHS.

**Initiative 3: Strengthening What Works**. Scaling pilot programs demonstrating effectiveness. Expanding successful small-scale initiatives to broader geographic reach. This initiative recognizes that rural South Carolina already contains programs worth expanding rather than requiring entirely new models.

**Initiative 4: Building Tomorrow**. Infrastructure investments in healthcare facilities. Equipment modernization and facility improvements within federal guidelines prohibiting major construction. Emergency department updates, telehealth connectivity, and clinical technology deployment.

**Initiative 5: Incubating Solutions**. Innovation funding for health technology startups. Entrepreneurial approaches to rural health delivery challenges. Explicit risk acceptance that some investments will fail. The initiative acknowledges uncertainty about which approaches will succeed, positioning failure as acceptable cost of finding transformative models.

## Policy Alignment

South Carolina's application secured competitive workload scoring through regulatory environment factors:

| Policy Area | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| SNAP food restrictions | Not enacted |
| Certificate of need | **CON requirements in place** |
| Interstate licensure compacts | **Multiple compacts enacted** |
| Scope of practice | Limited expansion |
| Short-term limited-duration insurance | State-regulated |
| Telehealth policies | **Expanding framework** |
| Medicaid expansion | **Not expanded** |

South Carolina's **certificate-of-need requirements** may limit market entry for new facilities, though they also protect existing rural hospitals from competition. The state's participation in **interstate licensure compacts** supports telehealth workforce flexibility. The non-expansion status creates the fundamental coverage limitation affecting all RHTP initiatives.

## Social Care Integration

South Carolina's application **addresses social determinants through mobile care and community outreach** rather than explicit SDOH infrastructure. The approach assumes health improvements come through access expansion for populations already facing coverage barriers.

| Component | Application Status | Funding Allocation | Survival Assessment |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| SDOH Screening | Via mobile units | Embedded | Uncertain |
| HRSN Navigation | Limited scope | Not distinct | At Risk |
| CHW Programs | Clemson model | Part of mobile funding | Moderate |
| CIE Platform | Not explicit focus | Not allocated | Not Prioritized |

**Community Health Workers**: Clemson Rural Health operates mobile units with community health workers serving uninsured patients. Only about half of Clemson Rural Health patients have insurance coverage, compared to 92 percent nationally. The program depends on $2.5 million in annual state contract funding from SCDHHS.

**SDOH/HRSN Components**: Mobile health programs provide some SDOH screening and referrals, but South Carolina does not propose comprehensive HRSN navigation infrastructure or statewide CIE deployment.

**Technology Vendor Landscape**: No explicit CIE platform is proposed. Telehealth infrastructure emphasizes clinical connectivity rather than social service referral networks.

**Survival Assessment**: Social care integration components face significant risk under partial funding given their embedding within broader mobile health initiatives rather than distinct program allocation.

## Key Subawardees

Anticipated major subawardees and partners include:

| Organization | Expected Role |
|--------------|---------------|
| South Carolina Hospital Association | Technical assistance, hospital coordination |
| South Carolina Primary Health Care Association | FQHC coordination |
| Clemson Rural Health | Mobile health delivery, CHW deployment |
| Medical University of South Carolina | Academic partnership, telehealth hub |
| CareSouth Carolina | FQHC network serving Pee Dee region |
| McLeod Health | Regional health system partnership |
| Prisma Health | Statewide health system partnership |
| Regional Medical Center of Orangeburg | Lowcountry access |
| Local EMS organizations | Mobile care integration |

**Clemson Rural Health** warrants specific attention. The program demonstrates both potential and limitation of mobile health models. Its dependence on state contract funding illustrates sustainability questions RHTP investment cannot fully resolve.

## Assessment

**Strengths**

**Comprehensive Stakeholder Input**. Over 350 stakeholder proposals informed application development. This engagement produced broad buy-in across healthcare providers, community organizations, and local officials. The breadth of participation suggests transformation efforts will have support across the healthcare community.

**Mobile Health Foundation**. Clemson Rural Health's existing mobile program provides operational infrastructure for expansion. The state is not building from scratch. Mobile health units already operate across rural South Carolina, demonstrating operational feasibility and community acceptance.

**Innovation Emphasis**. The Incubating Solutions initiative explicitly accepts entrepreneurial risk, potentially generating transformative approaches that conventional programs would not fund. This willingness to accept failure as part of innovation distinguishes South Carolina from states taking more conservative approaches.

**Telehealth Investment**. Technology infrastructure can bridge geographic distance for consultation and follow-up care, partially compensating for specialist shortages. The Connections to Care initiative addresses the fundamental geographic barrier that prevents rural residents from accessing specialty care.

**Regional System Partnerships**. McLeod Health, Prisma Health, and the Medical University of South Carolina provide system-level partnerships that can extend reach beyond individual rural facilities. These relationships create referral networks and specialist access that standalone rural facilities cannot achieve.

**Vulnerabilities**

**Coverage Gap**. The fundamental constraint remains unaddressed. Every initiative operates within the limitation that significant portions of the target population cannot afford services delivered through RHTP-funded infrastructure. This is not a problem RHTP can solve. It is a political choice that undermines transformation effectiveness.

**Hospital Financial Exposure**. Seven rural hospitals at closure risk face pressures RHTP cannot offset. Infrastructure investment helps only if hospitals survive to use it. The Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform analysis suggests four facilities face immediate closure risk, creating urgency that five-year transformation planning cannot address.

**SDOH Infrastructure Gaps**. Lack of explicit CIE investment and limited HRSN navigation capacity may constrain social care integration effectiveness. South Carolina's application emphasizes clinical access over social determinants infrastructure, potentially missing opportunities to address upstream factors affecting health outcomes.

**Sustainability Dependence**. Mobile health programs require ongoing operational funding. Without state commitment beyond 2030, programs face discontinuation. The Clemson Rural Health dependence on annual SCDHHS contracts illustrates vulnerability to future budget decisions.

**Political Constraints**. Governor McMaster supports RHTP while maintaining opposition to Medicaid expansion. This position contains inherent tension: transformation requires coverage that political leadership refuses to provide. Until that changes, South Carolina operates with one hand tied behind its back.

**Regional Comparison**

The Black Belt extends from Alabama through Georgia into South Carolina, carrying the legacy of extraction economics and systematic underinvestment. Regional comparison reveals divergent approaches:

- **Georgia** implemented partial Medicaid expansion in 2023, providing insurance foundation
- **Alabama** faces similar non-expansion constraints but different population distribution
- **North Carolina** recently expanded Medicaid, demonstrating transformation potential

South Carolina's **refusal to expand Medicaid** places it with Alabama among the most constrained states in the Black Belt corridor. The comparison suggests that states achieving meaningful transformation will be those that address coverage before or alongside infrastructure investment.

**Sustainability Prospects**

**Technology infrastructure** (telehealth platforms, health kiosks) can generate lasting benefit if utilization supports ongoing maintenance. If uninsured populations cannot afford telehealth visits, infrastructure becomes stranded asset.

**Mobile health programs** depend on operational funding beyond capital investment. Clemson Rural Health's current dependence on SCDHHS contracts illustrates the sustainability question.

**Workforce recruitment** produces temporary effects. Providers attracted by incentives may remain if they find professional satisfaction. Many will depart when incentive periods expire.

**The 2030 cliff** affects all initiatives requiring ongoing support. Without state commitment to continued investment, RHTP-initiated programs face reversal when federal funding ends.

**Critical Success Factors**

1. **Coverage expansion** remains the critical variable. Limited Medicaid expansion to working parents (11,400 potential enrollees) helps but does not address the broader coverage gap
2. **Mobile health sustainability** requires state funding commitment beyond RHTP period
3. **Hospital stabilization** depends on factors RHTP cannot control, including payer mix and Medicaid reimbursement
4. **Technology adoption** must generate sufficient utilization to justify maintenance costs
5. **Innovation investments** must produce at least some successful models among inevitable failures

## Conclusion

South Carolina's RHTP application represents thoughtful response to genuine challenges. The five-initiative structure addresses real barriers through proven mechanisms. Stakeholder engagement produced comprehensive proposals informing strategic direction.

The fundamental problem remains unsolved. South Carolina has declined Medicaid expansion for fifteen years. The coverage gap population, the working poor who clean hotel rooms, stock grocery shelves, and harvest crops, cannot access healthcare they cannot afford regardless of infrastructure improvements.

RHTP in South Carolina **builds the house but leaves residents outside**. Telehealth connects patients with specialists they cannot pay. Mobile units deliver screenings that reveal conditions patients cannot treat. Hospital infrastructure serves insured populations while the uninsured continue presenting at emergency departments with advanced disease.

This is not failure of planning or implementation. South Carolina's application demonstrates sophisticated understanding of rural health challenges. **The failure is political**: sustained refusal to accept federal funding that would cover the state's poorest residents.

Until that changes, rural health transformation in South Carolina operates within constraints guaranteeing incomplete results. The infrastructure will improve. The coverage gap will persist. The health outcomes will remain among the nation's worst.

**What to Watch**

- **Q1 2026**: Cooperative agreement finalization with CMS
- **2026**: Mobile health expansion rollout and telehealth deployment
- **2026**: Hospital closure risk developments for seven at-risk facilities
- **2026-2027**: Medicaid waiver request status for limited parental expansion
- **2030**: Sustainability assessment as federal funding approaches cliff
