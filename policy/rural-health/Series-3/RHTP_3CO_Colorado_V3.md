# RHTP 3.CO: Colorado

*Mountain West innovation meeting rural reality: ten coordinated initiatives across 52 counties and two tribal nations.*

## Introduction

Colorado received **$200.1 million for FY2026**, among the higher allocations nationally and near the full amount state officials hoped to secure. The five-year projection approaches $1 billion. For the **800,000 Coloradans living in 52 rural and frontier counties**, this represents substantial per-capita investment in a state that has both progressive health policy ambitions and severe geographic challenges.

The state's approach is distinctive for its comprehensiveness: **ten coordinated initiatives** spanning prevention, access, workforce, innovation, and technology. Colorado emphasizes that 13% of healthcare facilities serve 81% of the state's land area, creating efficiency challenges that no funding level fully resolves. The question is whether ambitious scope translates into meaningful transformation or diffuses resources across too many priorities.

## Rural Health Landscape

**Geographic Reality**

Colorado encompasses **104,094 square miles** with population concentrated along the Front Range corridor from Fort Collins through Denver to Colorado Springs. Everything east of I-25 and west of the mountains is rural, much of it frontier.

**52 of 64 counties carry rural or frontier designation.** Twenty-three qualify as frontier, lacking critical specialty care access including behavioral health, obstetric, and gynecology services. The practical implication: the state must build systems serving vastly different terrains, from high plains to mountain valleys, with distances that make traditional hub-and-spoke models impractical.

**Healthcare Infrastructure**

| Facility Type | Count | Notes |
|---------------|-------|-------|
| Critical Access Hospitals | 32 | CAH designation for Medicare cost-based reimbursement |
| Other Rural Hospitals | 12 | Including rural PPS and specialty hospitals |
| Rural Health Clinics | 87 | Primary care access points |
| Rural FQHC Sites | 45+ | Community health center locations |
| Federally Recognized Tribes | 2 | Southern Ute, Ute Mountain Ute |

The **Colorado Rural Health Center** serves as the State Office of Rural Health, coordinating rural health initiatives since 1991. CEO Michelle Mills noted RHTP funding provides opportunity for creative solutions through workforce, technology, and innovation.

**Workforce Crisis**

Colorado faces **pronounced health professional shortages** that worsen in rural areas:

- **77% of rural counties** designated as health professional shortage areas
- **27 of 64 counties lack obstetric care**, affecting 40% of the state's population
- Nursing shortage projected to worsen through 2030
- Primary care physician ratios vary dramatically by county
- Behavioral health provider shortage covers nearly all rural areas

The **Colorado Rural Health-care Workforce Initiative** (SB22-172) allocates state funds to 12 institutions to address coverage gaps, but demand exceeds training capacity. Rural facilities compete for graduates who often prefer urban positions with higher compensation and better amenities.

**Behavioral Health Emergency**

Rural Colorado faces a behavioral health crisis that transcends workforce numbers:

- Eastern plains counties experience the state's highest suicide rates
- Substance use treatment access requires multi-hour drives for most rural residents
- Community mental health center coverage is sparse outside population centers
- Crisis stabilization capacity is effectively absent in frontier areas

The **Colorado Behavioral Healthcare Council** emphasized behavioral health integration as foundational to sustainable rural health systems, positioning RHTP as an opportunity to ensure whole-person care access statewide.

## RHTP Award and Context

**Funding Position**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| FY2026 Allocation | $200,105,604 |
| Baseline Component | $100,000,000 |
| Workload Component | ~$100,100,000 |
| Five-Year Projected Total | ~$1.0 billion |
| Rural Population | ~800,000 |
| Per Rural Resident | ~$250 |
| National Average | ~$164 |

Colorado's per-capita funding exceeds national averages, reflecting both strong application scoring and moderate rural population size. The workload allocation nearly equals the baseline, indicating competitive performance on CMS scoring factors.

**Medicaid Context**

Colorado is a **Medicaid expansion state**, having expanded eligibility under the Affordable Care Act. This provides an insurance coverage foundation that non-expansion states lack. Approximately **1.5 million Coloradans** receive Medicaid coverage.

The H.R. 1 Medicaid restructuring creates uncertainty. Per-capita caps and work requirements could reduce federal matching, though Colorado's expansion status provides more protection than non-expansion states face. The net Medicaid math remains favorable but not guaranteed.

Rural providers depend heavily on Medicaid given the demographics of rural populations. Any coverage erosion amplifies financial pressure on facilities already operating on thin margins.

**Administrative Approach**

Colorado committed to **administrative costs below 3%** (specifically 2.98%), dedicating resources to direct program implementation rather than state agency overhead. This distinguishes Colorado from states allocating higher administrative percentages.

## State Approach

**Governance Structure**

**Colorado Department of Health Care Policy and Financing (HCPF)** serves as lead agency under Governor Jared Polis's designation. Executive Director **Kim Bimestefer** oversees implementation. HCPF administers Medicaid and brings experience managing large federal healthcare programs.

Application development involved formal stakeholder engagement:

- Stakeholder session September 23, 2025 (1:00 to 2:30 PM)
- Stakeholder sessions October 2, 2025 (111 morning attendees, 72 afternoon attendees)
- Core Working Group beginning September 22, 2025
- RHTP Advisory Committee for ongoing implementation guidance

**Strategic Framework**

Colorado organized its approach around **five federal grant program priority areas** containing ten specific initiatives:

1. **Make Rural America Healthy Again**: Transform rural care, build data infrastructure, expand preventive care
2. **Sustainable Access**: Build and connect rural health networks, strengthen rural care delivery systems, sustain hospital operations
3. **Workforce Development**: Strengthen and expand workforce, state and local coordination
4. **Innovative Care**: Design and pilot rural value-based care models
5. **Tech Innovation**: Expand rural telehealth and technology integration

The state explicitly adopted a **provider-first model** for fund distribution. Only eligible rural providers (CAHs, rural hospitals, RHCs, FQHCs, EMS organizations, behavioral health providers, tribal health facilities) may apply directly for funding. Other organizations participate as partners or subrecipients within provider-led applications.

## Program Allocation Framework

Colorado's ten initiatives distribute approximately $1 billion over five years:

| Initiative | Focus | Five-Year Allocation | Share |
|------------|-------|---------------------|-------|
| Make Rural America Healthy Again (1, 2, 7) | Prevention, data, chronic disease | ~$230M | 23% |
| Sustainable Access (3, 4, 5) | Networks, care delivery, hospital operations | ~$106M | 11% |
| Workforce Development (6, 8) | Workforce expansion, coordination | ~$149M | 15% |
| Innovative Care (9) | Value-based payment models | ~$230M | 23% |
| Tech Innovation (10) | Telehealth, technology integration | ~$256M | 26% |
| Administration | Program management | ~$30M | 3% |

**Initiative Details**

**Initiative 1 (Transform Rural Care)**: Chronic disease prevention training and credentialing for local residents. Regional collaborations to coordinate prevention efforts. Community health worker referral systems.

**Initiative 2 (Build Data Infrastructure)**: Chronic disease dashboards for tracking population health. Performance monitoring and evaluation systems. Data collection infrastructure for prevention programs.

**Initiative 3 (Build and Connect Rural Health Networks)**: Regional partnerships promoting quality improvement and financial stability. Resource sharing to improve administrative efficiency.

**Initiative 4 (Strengthen Rural Care Delivery)**: Delivery system transformation to meet rural community needs. Mobile health and alternative care models.

**Initiative 5 (Sustain Hospital Operations)**: Support for essential services expansion and coordination. Modernization of operations and regulatory compliance. Equipment and infrastructure improvements (within federal guidelines prohibiting major construction).

**Initiative 6 (Strengthen and Expand Workforce)**: Physician, nurse, and paramedic recruitment and retention. Credentialing process streamlining. Continuing education expansion. Five-year service commitments for RHTP-supported positions.

**Initiative 7 (Expand Preventive Care)**: Fruit and vegetable incentive/prescription programs. Population-level prevention initiatives aligned with MAHA priorities.

**Initiative 8 (State and Local Coordination)**: Interagency coordination training. Support for Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment rural health activities. Advisory committee facilitation.

**Initiative 9 (Design and Pilot Rural VBC Models)**: Value-based care pilot development. Hospital quality improvement programs through collaborative agreements. New payment model design and implementation.

**Initiative 10 (Expand Rural Telehealth and Technology Integration)**: Remote patient monitoring and telehealth solutions. Chronic Access and Prevention (CAP) dashboards. Cybersecurity readiness training. Technology grants for rural facilities.

## Social Care Integration

Colorado's application **emphasizes clinical access and chronic disease prevention** over explicit social determinants of health infrastructure. The approach assumes health improvements come primarily through care access, prevention programs, and behavioral health integration.

| Component | Application Status | Funding Allocation | Survival Assessment |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| SDOH Screening | Embedded in prevention | Not distinct | Moderate |
| HRSN Navigation | Via CHW referrals | Embedded in workforce | Uncertain |
| CHW Programs | Included in workforce | Part of $149M | Likely |
| CIE Platform | Not explicit focus | Not distinct | Not prioritized |

**Community Health Workers**: Colorado includes CHW deployment within workforce initiatives, funding referral-focused community health workers and credentialing programs. This positions CHWs as part of the care delivery system rather than as a distinct social care intervention.

**SDOH/HRSN Components**: Prevention programs (fruit and vegetable incentives, chronic disease management) address some social determinants but the application does not propose comprehensive HRSN screening or navigation infrastructure.

**Technology Vendor Landscape**: The CAP (Chronic Access and Prevention) dashboard represents Colorado's technology investment, focused on clinical chronic disease tracking rather than social service referral networks. No explicit CIE platform is proposed.

**Tribal Health Integration**: Colorado explicitly includes its two federally recognized tribes (Southern Ute Indian Tribe, Ute Mountain Ute Tribe) as eligible providers. Tribal members experience barriers to care including chronic disease management needs and behavioral health access. Crisis care and substance use treatment are priorities identified through tribal consultation.

## Key Subawardees

Colorado's application requires providers to apply through a competitive Request for Applications process after the cooperative agreement is finalized. Anticipated major subawardees include:

| Organization | Expected Role |
|--------------|---------------|
| Colorado Rural Health Center | Technical assistance, network coordination |
| Colorado Hospital Association | Hospital technical assistance, collaborative quality improvement |
| Colorado Community Health Network | FQHC coordination and representation |
| Colorado Behavioral Healthcare Council | Behavioral health integration, CCBHC coordination |
| University of Colorado Health | Academic partnership, telehealth hub potential |
| Spanish Peaks Regional Health Center | Southern Colorado implementation partner |
| Southern Ute Indian Tribe | Tribal health implementation |
| Ute Mountain Ute Tribe | Tribal health implementation |
| Local EMS organizations | Prehospital care transformation |
| Community Mental Health Centers | Behavioral health network |

**Eligible Applicant Categories**:
- Critical Access Hospitals and other rural hospitals
- Rural Health Clinics
- Federally Qualified Health Centers and look-alikes
- Behavioral health providers (CMHCs, behavioral health clinics, opioid treatment programs)
- EMS providers
- Tribal health facilities

Nonprofits, academic institutions, and public health agencies may **not apply directly** but may participate as partners or subrecipients within provider-led applications.

## Policy Alignment

Colorado's application secured strong workload scoring despite political complexity as a Democratic-led state applying to a Republican administration program:

| Policy Area | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| SNAP food restrictions | Not enacted |
| Certificate of need | **No CON requirements** |
| Interstate licensure compacts | **Enacted** (multiple compacts) |
| Scope of practice | **Partial expansion** |
| Short-term limited-duration insurance | State-regulated |
| Telehealth policies | **Supportive framework** |

Colorado lacks SNAP restrictions that some states used for MAHA alignment scoring. However, the state's **absence of certificate-of-need requirements** and **multiple interstate licensure compacts** provide regulatory environment advantages that CMS scores positively.

The bipartisan congressional delegation supported the application, with a November 2025 letter to CMS Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz endorsing Colorado's plan to strengthen and sustain rural health systems.

## Assessment

**Strengths**

**Comprehensive Scope**. Ten coordinated initiatives address the full range of rural health challenges. Unlike states focusing narrowly on hospital stabilization or workforce, Colorado attempts system-wide transformation.

**Strong Administrative Efficiency**. The 2.98% administrative cost commitment maximizes resources flowing to providers and programs. This compares favorably to states with higher administrative allocations.

**Behavioral Health Integration**. Explicit inclusion of behavioral health providers as eligible applicants and integration of behavioral health within the transformation framework addresses a critical gap.

**Tribal Inclusion**. Meaningful engagement with both federally recognized tribes and their inclusion as eligible direct applicants positions Colorado for equitable implementation across all rural populations.

**Existing Infrastructure**. Colorado Rural Health Center and established associations provide coordination capacity. The state is not building from scratch.

**Medicaid Expansion Foundation**. Insurance coverage baseline reduces the magnitude of access challenges. Providers have payer mix advantages over non-expansion states.

**Vulnerabilities**

**Diffusion Risk**. Ten initiatives across five priority areas may spread resources too thin. States with more focused approaches may achieve greater impact in targeted areas.

**Value-Based Care Uncertainty**. The $230 million VBC allocation assumes rural providers can successfully transition to value-based payment. Evidence for rural VBC success is limited. This represents significant financial risk if pilots underperform.

**Frontier Geography**. Twenty-three frontier counties face challenges that even generous funding cannot overcome. No initiative directly addresses the fundamental problem of distance in low-population areas.

**SDOH Infrastructure Absence**. The lack of explicit CIE or comprehensive HRSN investment may limit the state's ability to address social factors driving poor health outcomes.

**Political Dynamics**. A Democratic-led state implementing a Republican administration program faces political uncertainty. Administration priorities may shift in ways that affect future workload scoring.

**Sustainability Prospects**

Colorado's **provider-focused model** creates sustainability questions. Initiatives dependent on provider organizations have built-in sustainability if those organizations remain viable. However, workforce programs and technology investments require ongoing support.

**Value-based payment transition** offers potential sustainability if pilots demonstrate success. Payers may continue VBC models that improve outcomes and reduce costs. But failure would leave transformation incomplete.

**Technology infrastructure** (telehealth platforms, data dashboards) can generate lasting benefit if adoption persists. The CAP dashboard and remote monitoring capabilities represent permanent infrastructure rather than time-limited programs.

The **2030 cliff** affects initiatives requiring operational funding. Prevention programs, workforce incentives, and coordination support need ongoing resources. Without state commitment or payer transition, these face discontinuation risk.

**Critical Success Factors**

1. **RFA execution**: Competitive application process must attract strong provider proposals and distribute funds efficiently
2. **VBC pilot performance**: Value-based care initiatives must demonstrate measurable outcomes to justify continued investment
3. **Workforce pipeline**: Recruitment and retention programs must produce measurable provider increases
4. **Behavioral health integration**: Mental health and substance use treatment access must improve in measurable ways
5. **Tribal partnership**: Effective collaboration with Southern Ute and Ute Mountain Ute tribes for proportionate benefit

## Conclusion

Colorado's RHTP implementation reflects the state's characteristic ambition: comprehensive scope, multiple coordinated initiatives, and explicit attention to behavioral health integration. The $200 million annual investment can meaningfully advance transformation across the state's 52 rural and frontier counties.

The critical question is whether comprehensive ambition produces proportionally comprehensive results or whether focus would generate greater impact. Colorado is betting that rural health transformation requires simultaneous investment across prevention, access, workforce, innovation, and technology. If that theory proves correct, the state builds a model other states might follow.

The provider-first distribution model ensures funds flow to organizations delivering care. The 3% administrative cap maximizes resources reaching communities. The tribal inclusion positions Colorado for equitable impact.

Yet **23 frontier counties still lack specialty care access**. No amount of telehealth or value-based payment transitions fully compensates for the absence of local providers. Colorado's transformation may improve what exists rather than create what is missing. For the most isolated rural Coloradans, that distinction matters.
