# RHTP 3.IL: Illinois
## The Agricultural Heartland Paradox

*Series 3: State Implementation*

Illinois received **$193.4 million in FY2026 RHTP funding**, positioning the state below the national average of $200 million despite serving 1.9 million rural residents across 85 counties with rural census tracts. This outcome reflects the formula's structural tension: Illinois contains the nation's third-largest metropolitan area, which dilutes rurality metrics even as vast stretches of downstate territory face healthcare access crises indistinguishable from those in states perceived as more rural.

The state's five-year projected total of **approximately $967 million** arrives as Governor JB Pritzker explicitly acknowledges that RHTP funding "will be far from enough to counteract the cuts imposed to the Medicaid program through various provisions in the Trump administration's budget bill." Illinois approaches RHTP implementation with clear-eyed recognition that $50 billion nationally represents partial compensation for $911 billion in projected Medicaid cuts, not comprehensive rural health transformation.

## Rural Health Landscape

### State Context

Illinois spans **57,915 square miles** across 102 counties, with approximately **1.9 million residents** living in rural areas, representing roughly 15% of the state's 12.8 million population. This percentage understates rural healthcare challenges because Illinois' geography creates two distinct realities: the Chicago metropolitan region containing Cook County and surrounding collar counties, and the predominantly agricultural downstate region where healthcare access mirrors conditions in states like Iowa and Missouri.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Population | 12.8 million |
| Rural Population | 1.9 million |
| Percentage Rural | 15% |
| Total Counties | 102 |
| Counties with Rural Census Tracts | 85 |
| Rural Medicaid Enrollees | ~500,000 |

Eighty-five of Illinois' 102 counties contain rural census tracts as designated by the Health Resources and Services Administration. This includes counties that are predominantly rural and counties with mixed urban-rural populations. The Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services directs RHTP funding toward entities serving residents in these rural census tracts, creating geographic eligibility criteria that extend beyond fully rural counties.

The **nearly 500,000 rural Medicaid enrollees** represent a critical population for RHTP investment. Governor Pritzker's letter supporting Illinois' RHTP application emphasized this population's scale, noting that Medicaid cuts threaten the coverage foundation that transformed services require. Illinois expanded Medicaid under the ACA and became the **first state to extend postpartum coverage to 12 months** in 2021, demonstrating policy commitment to coverage continuity that RHTP builds upon.

### Healthcare Infrastructure

Illinois maintains a substantial rural healthcare infrastructure facing financial and workforce pressures common to agricultural states:

| Facility Type | Count | Notes |
|---------------|-------|-------|
| Small and Rural Hospitals | 86 | Including CAHs and small PPS hospitals |
| Critical Access Hospitals | 60 | ICAHN network members |
| Rural Health Clinics | 100+ | Primary care access points |
| Federally Qualified Health Centers | 50+ | Including 160+ Chicago-area sites |
| Community Mental Health Centers | 180+ | Statewide network |

The **86 small and rural hospitals** identified by the Illinois Health and Hospital Association provide lifesaving care daily while facing structural challenges. Nearly 98% of these hospitals have fewer than 150 beds, limiting economies of scale. **29.4% operate on negative or thin margins**, making them vulnerable to revenue disruptions including Medicaid cuts, workforce cost increases, and payer mix deterioration.

The **Illinois Critical Access Hospital Network (ICAHN)** serves as the organizing entity for 60 CAHs across the state. ICAHN provides professional education services, workforce development seminars, remote coding services, survey solutions, and technical assistance that help member hospitals maintain operational viability. The SOAR-RN Nurse Residency Program supports newly licensed rural nurses' transition to practice, addressing retention challenges in communities that struggle to compete with urban employers.

OSF HealthCare, a 17-hospital system headquartered in Peoria, exemplifies strategic approaches to rural health delivery. The system has added eight acute care hospitals since 2012, employs nearly 26,000 people across 171 locations, and generates approximately **$872 million in net Medicaid revenue** representing 20% of total net patient service revenue. For systems like OSF, Medicaid cuts directly threaten the financial foundation supporting rural hospital operations.

### Health Professional Shortages

Illinois' workforce shortages concentrate disproportionately in rural counties despite the state's strong academic medical infrastructure:

| Designation Type | Affected Counties |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Primary Care HPSA | 60 of 65 rural counties |
| Mental Health HPSA | 64 of 65 rural counties |
| Dental HPSA | 57 of 65 rural counties |

Governor Pritzker's RHTP support letter documented these shortages starkly: of Illinois' 65 rural counties, **60 have shortages of primary care**, **64 lack adequate mental health services**, and **57 have gaps in dental care**. These designations cover nearly the entire rural geography, indicating systemic rather than localized workforce deficits.

The **National Center for Rural Health Professions** at the University of Illinois College of Medicine at Rockford focuses on meeting healthcare needs of rural Illinois residents through recruitment, retention, and healthcare delivery initiatives. Yet training pipelines cannot produce results within RHTP's five-year window. Physician training requires 11 to 14 years from undergraduate entry to independent practice. Even nurse practitioner and physician assistant programs require six to eight years.

The **Illinois Telehealth Network** works to improve healthcare access by developing telemedicine services for rural and underserved populations. The **Upper Midwest Telehealth Resource Center** serves Illinois along with Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio, providing implementation support for telehealth programs. These organizations represent existing infrastructure that RHTP can leverage rather than build from scratch.

### Health Outcomes and Disparities

Rural Illinois residents face worse health outcomes than urban counterparts across multiple dimensions:

| Health Indicator | Rural Illinois Context |
|------------------|----------------------|
| Hypertension Rates | Higher than urban counties |
| Diabetes Prevalence | Higher than urban counties |
| Infant Mortality | Higher in rural areas |
| Maternal Mortality | Higher for Medicaid recipients (4x vs. private insurance) |
| Chronic Disease Burden | Elevated relative to Chicago suburbs |

The Illinois Department of Public Health's maternal mortality data reveal stark disparities. **Medicaid recipients died from pregnancy-related conditions almost four times as frequently as those with private insurance.** While maternal mortality rates in rural counties decreased marginally in recent data, pregnant people in rural locations still face barriers including lack of providers and long travel distances to specialized care for mental health services, substance use disorder treatment, and chronic condition management.

The state's **Illinois Blueprint for Birth Equity**, released in September 2025, recommended that health insurance plans including Medicaid incentivize maternal health providers to practice in rural areas and small hospitals. This recommendation directly informed RHTP application priorities around workforce distribution and practice support.

## RHTP Award and Context

| Metric | Illinois | National Average |
|--------|----------|------------------|
| FY2026 Award | $193.4 million | $200 million |
| Five-Year Projected Total | ~$967 million | ~$1 billion |
| Rural Population | 1.9 million | Varies |
| Per-Capita (Rural) | ~$102 | ~$150 |
| Award Rank | Below Average | N/A |
| Rural Hospital Count | 86 | Varies |

Illinois received below-average funding despite serving a rural population exceeding that of most states. The **$102 per rural resident** annual allocation compares unfavorably to states like Wyoming, Montana, and Alaska that receive $300 or more per capita. This reflects RHTP's formula design rewarding geographic sparsity over population size, creating the "scale penalty" that disadvantages populous states with substantial rural populations.

### Formula Position

Illinois' allocation reflects tension between population scale and rurality metrics:

- **50% equal distribution:** $100 million baseline regardless of rural population
- **50% workload factors:** $93.4 million based on rurality metrics and application scoring

The $93.4 million workload allocation indicates that Illinois' application scored competently but could not overcome formula factors that disadvantage states where rural populations represent small percentages of total population. Chicago's presence dilutes statewide rurality ratios even though downstate healthcare challenges mirror those in states receiving higher per-capita funding.

### Political Context

Governor Pritzker's explicit criticism of federal Medicaid cuts while accepting RHTP funding illustrates Illinois' political approach. The state acknowledges RHTP's value while refusing to treat it as adequate compensation for structural damage to rural healthcare financing. State Representative Nikki Budzinski stated that "this increased need exists only because of Medicaid cuts pushed by the Trump administration and passed by Republicans in Washington."

Illinois operates from a position of policy strength: **full Medicaid expansion** since 2014, **12-month postpartum coverage extension** since 2021, **doula Medicaid reimbursement**, and state-level requirements for anti-bias training in obstetric care. RHTP arrives in a state that has already implemented policies other states are seeking to adopt.

## Strategic Framework

### Lead Agency and Governance

The **Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services (HFS)** serves as lead agency for RHTP implementation. HFS administers Illinois Medicaid, coordinates care coordination programs, and works with community mental health centers and Rural Health Clinics. This positioning aligns RHTP with the state's primary healthcare financing mechanism.

HFS developed Illinois' application in strategic partnership with nine state agencies and over 20 provider associations. Stakeholder engagement included discussions with rural hospitals, community health centers, community mental health centers, universities, community colleges, legislators, and advocates. The Illinois Rural Health Association provided coordination across stakeholder groups.

### Theory of Change

Illinois' RHTP strategy rests on three interconnected premises:

**First,** regional partnerships can generate economies of scale that individual rural facilities cannot achieve independently. By incentivizing collaboration between hospitals, health providers, and community organizations, transformation initiatives create shared infrastructure supporting multiple delivery points.

**Second,** technology and mobile services can overcome geographic barriers without requiring facility construction in every underserved community. Telehealth, mobile health units, and mobile crisis response extend specialist reach beyond physical locations where specialists cannot sustainably practice.

**Third,** workforce pipeline investment requires coordination across educational institutions, healthcare employers, and professional development programs. Individual employers cannot build training infrastructure alone, but regional approaches spanning community colleges, universities, and employer partnerships can sustain recruitment flows.

## Program Allocation Overview

| Initiative Category | Focus Areas | Key Mechanisms |
|--------------------|-------------|----------------|
| Transforming Rural Healthcare Delivery | Regional partnerships, service line transformation, value-based care | Hospital transformation grants, VBP incentives |
| Overcoming Geographic Barriers | Mobile health, telehealth, EMS infrastructure | Infrastructure investment, equipment procurement |
| Building Resilient Workforce | Training pipelines, scholarships, apprenticeships | University expansion, community college programs |

### Initiative 1: Transforming Rural Healthcare Delivery

Illinois' delivery transformation initiative addresses the **29.4% of small and rural hospitals operating on negative or thin margins** through mechanisms designed to improve financial sustainability rather than merely provide temporary revenue supplements.

**Regional Healthcare Partnerships** represent the initiative's organizing framework. Rather than directing funds to individual hospitals, Illinois incentivizes partnership formation where hospitals, primary care practices, specialists, and community organizations coordinate services across geographic areas. This approach builds on OSF HealthCare's regional model, which has sustained rural hospitals through system integration.

**Hospital Transformation Grants** provide capital and operating support for facilities implementing service line changes. This may include expanding services (behavioral health, chronic disease management), converting inpatient capacity to outpatient or emergency-only models, or developing specialty partnerships with academic medical centers. The grants acknowledge that rural hospital survival may require fundamental restructuring rather than preservation of current service configurations.

**Value-Based Payment Initiatives** shift reimbursement toward outcomes rather than volume. Illinois Medicaid already requires managed care organizations to report quality measures by race, ethnicity, and geography. RHTP extends value-based frameworks to rural providers, creating financial incentives for chronic disease management, preventive care, and care coordination that reduce total cost while improving health.

**Practice Transformation through Team-Based Care** addresses workforce shortages by expanding scope of practice for non-physician providers. Advanced practice nurses, physician assistants, pharmacists, community health workers, and care coordinators work in integrated teams that extend physician capacity without requiring proportional physician workforce growth.

### Initiative 2: Overcoming Geographic Barriers

Illinois' geographic barrier strategy addresses structural challenges facing rural residents who live hours from specialty care:

**Emergency Medical Services Infrastructure** investment recognizes that rural EMS systems face workforce and financial challenges parallel to those affecting hospitals. Many rural Illinois communities depend on volunteer emergency services facing recruitment difficulty as populations age. RHTP funds support paid EMS positions, equipment upgrades, and training programs that maintain emergency response capability.

**Mobile Health Units** extend healthcare services to communities without permanent facilities. These units can provide primary care, behavioral health services, chronic disease management, and preventive screenings in locations where demand does not support full-time facilities. The mobile model is particularly relevant for agricultural communities where population density does not support fixed clinics.

**Mobile Crisis Units** address behavioral health emergencies in communities lacking psychiatric facilities or crisis stabilization services. Illinois' 180+ community mental health centers provide core behavioral health infrastructure, but crisis response requires mobile capability to reach patients where emergencies occur rather than requiring transport to distant facilities.

**Telehealth Expansion** builds on existing infrastructure including the Illinois Telehealth Network, Illinois Medicaid telehealth policies, and FQHC telehealth capacity. Illinois Medicaid covers telemedicine and telepsychiatry services, with separate policies for encounter clinics and individual practitioners. RHTP investment expands broadband infrastructure, provides equipment to originating sites, and supports training for providers new to virtual care delivery.

### Initiative 3: Building Resilient Workforce

Illinois' workforce strategy addresses the **60 of 65 rural counties with primary care shortages** through pipeline development rather than expecting immediate workforce expansion:

**Scholarship Programs** target students committing to rural practice after completing training. The scholarship approach acknowledges that financial barriers prevent many qualified candidates from pursuing healthcare careers, and that loan repayment alone may not overcome urban practice advantages for providers completing training with substantial debt.

**University Program Expansion** increases training capacity at institutions positioned to serve rural areas. The National Center for Rural Health Professions at UI-Rockford focuses specifically on rural workforce, and RHTP supports expansion of similar programs at other institutions. Medical school rural tracks, nursing programs, and allied health training receive investment proportional to projected rural practice rates.

**Community College Programming** addresses workforce segments achievable within RHTP's five-year window. Community health workers, medical assistants, certified nursing assistants, emergency medical technicians, and licensed practical nurses can complete training in one to two years and immediately strengthen rural healthcare delivery capacity. Programs like the Jersey Community Hospital partnership with Lewis and Clark Community College provide models for employer-educational institution collaboration.

**Regional Training and Certification Programs** coordinate across employers to provide continuing education, specialty certification, and career advancement opportunities that rural facilities cannot offer individually. ICAHN's professional education services demonstrate this approach for hospital staff, and RHTP extends similar models to other healthcare settings.

**Apprenticeship Programs** structured through employer partnerships provide earn-while-learning pathways into healthcare careers. These programs are particularly relevant for workforce development in communities where full-time educational enrollment creates financial hardship that prevents career entry.

## Social Care Integration

### SDOH and HRSN Components

Illinois' RHTP application references chronic disease prevention and population health management but does not prominently feature systematic SDOH screening requirements or dedicated HRSN navigation funding. Social care integration appears embedded within practice transformation and team-based care initiatives rather than established as distinct programming.

| Social Care Element | Status in Illinois Application |
|--------------------|-------------------------------|
| SDOH Screening Requirements | Not explicitly mandated |
| HRSN Navigation Funding | Embedded in care coordination |
| CHW Deployment | Referenced in workforce, details limited |
| CIE Platform | Not prominently featured |

This represents a gap relative to states explicitly prioritizing social care infrastructure. California's CalAIM, North Carolina's Healthy Opportunities Pilots, and other state initiatives have demonstrated that SDOH screening and closed-loop referral systems improve health outcomes. Illinois' application acknowledges social determinants conceptually but does not commit equivalent resources to social care infrastructure.

### Community Health Worker Programs

Community health workers appear within Illinois' workforce development framework but without specific deployment targets, employer arrangements, or funding allocations identified in available documentation. The Illinois Primary Health Care Association represents community health centers with established CHW programs, and some Illinois FQHCs employ CHWs for outreach, navigation, and care coordination.

The absence of explicit CHW programming in RHTP represents an opportunity cost. CHW training takes three months to one year, making this workforce category achievable within RHTP's timeline. States investing aggressively in CHW deployment can generate immediate impact on healthcare navigation, chronic disease management, and SDOH intervention that longer-pipeline workforce investments cannot match.

### Technology and CIE Infrastructure

Illinois' technology investment focuses on telehealth and health information technology infrastructure rather than community information exchange platforms for social care coordination. The state participates in health information exchange through multiple regional and statewide initiatives, but CIE for social services referral coordination is not prominently featured.

**211 Illinois** provides statewide information and referral services connecting residents with community resources. Integration between 211 and healthcare delivery systems represents existing infrastructure that RHTP could strengthen but which the application does not explicitly address.

| Technology Category | RHTP Investment Priority |
|--------------------|-------------------------|
| Telehealth Infrastructure | High priority |
| Health Information Exchange | Medium priority |
| Community Information Exchange | Not prominently featured |
| Social Care Referral Platforms | Not explicitly funded |

## Social Care Integration Table

| Component | Funded | Funding Level | Survival Likelihood |
|-----------|--------|---------------|---------------------|
| SDOH Screening | Embedded | Not specified | Depends on provider adoption |
| HRSN Navigation | Embedded | Not specified | Moderate |
| CHW Deployment | Referenced | Not specified | Uncertain |
| CIE Platform | Not featured | None identified | N/A |
| Social Care Technology | Limited | Not prioritized | Low |

## Critical Assessment

### Strengths

**Existing Infrastructure Base:** Illinois' 86 small and rural hospitals, 60 CAH network through ICAHN, extensive FQHC presence, and 180+ community mental health centers provide implementation infrastructure that RHTP can leverage. The state is not building from scratch.

**Policy Foundation:** Medicaid expansion, 12-month postpartum coverage, doula reimbursement, and birth equity initiatives create policy context that complements RHTP investment. Services transformed through RHTP can be accessed by populations that have coverage to pay for care.

**Stakeholder Engagement:** The application development process engaged nine state agencies and 20+ provider associations, creating buy-in across organizations that will participate in implementation. Margaret Vaughn of the Illinois Rural Health Association noted gratitude for the funding while acknowledging its limitations.

**Regional Partnership Framework:** The emphasis on regional partnerships rather than individual facility funding creates opportunities for efficiency gains and service coordination that isolated investments cannot achieve.

**Workforce Pipeline Realism:** The focus on community college programs and shorter-duration training acknowledges that physician pipeline investments cannot produce results within RHTP's timeline. CHW, CNA, EMT, and LPN training can strengthen rural capacity within two years.

### Vulnerabilities

**Below-Average Per-Capita Funding:** At $102 per rural resident annually, Illinois cannot invest as intensively as frontier states receiving $300+. The 1.9 million rural population disperses funding that other states concentrate on smaller populations.

**Social Care Gaps:** The absence of explicit SDOH screening requirements, dedicated CHW deployment funding, and CIE platform investment limits transformation scope. Practice transformation conceptually includes social care but does not establish systematic infrastructure.

**Medicaid Cut Exposure:** Governor Pritzker explicitly acknowledged that RHTP "will be far from enough to counteract the cuts imposed to the Medicaid program." Illinois rural providers depend heavily on Medicaid revenue, with OSF alone generating $872 million from Medicaid. Revenue losses may exceed transformation investment.

**Chicago Dilution Effect:** RHTP formula factors disadvantage Illinois because Chicago's presence reduces statewide rurality metrics even though downstate healthcare access parallels conditions in states receiving higher per-capita funding.

**Hospital Financial Fragility:** The 29.4% of small and rural hospitals operating on negative or thin margins represent facilities that may not survive the transformation period regardless of RHTP investment. Transformation assumes hospitals exist to be transformed.

### The 2030 Question

Illinois' RHTP strategy must answer fundamental questions about sustainability:

Will regional partnerships generate financial stability that persists after federal funding ends, or will hospitals return to isolated operations that current economics cannot sustain?

Can workforce pipeline investments produce lasting increases in rural practice, or will providers trained with RHTP support migrate to urban positions offering higher compensation and better quality of life?

Does telehealth infrastructure require ongoing operational funding that state budgets cannot sustain, or can transformed delivery models achieve financial viability through reimbursement?

**Critical dependency:** Illinois' sustainability prospects depend substantially on Medicaid policy decisions beyond state control. If federal Medicaid cuts reduce rural provider revenue during the transformation period, RHTP investment builds infrastructure for a system simultaneously experiencing revenue erosion.

### The Medicaid Math

Illinois faces stark arithmetic regarding RHTP and Medicaid interaction:

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| RHTP Five-Year Investment | +$967 million |
| Projected Medicaid Cuts (National) | -$911 billion over 10 years |
| Illinois Rural Medicaid Enrollees | ~500,000 |
| Potential Coverage Loss (State Estimate) | Subject to federal policy |

KFF estimates that the Trump administration's budget bill will cut $137 billion from rural healthcare providers nationally, nearly three times the $50 billion allocated through RHTP. Illinois' share of these cuts would substantially exceed its RHTP award.

For systems like OSF HealthCare, which generates 20% of net patient service revenue from Medicaid, revenue losses could dwarf transformation investment. Chief Financial Officer Kirsten Largent acknowledged strategic planning takes "a middle-of-the-road approach, not a worst-case scenario," suggesting uncertainty about the magnitude of losses that may materialize.

**Net position analysis:** RHTP represents significant investment in Illinois rural health, but the investment arrives alongside revenue reductions that may exceed it. Transformation that improves delivery efficiency while coverage losses reduce patient volume creates facilities better at serving populations that shrink rather than stabilize.

## Conclusion

Illinois' $193.4 million FY2026 award reflects competent application development within formula constraints that disadvantage populous states. The **three-pillar strategy** addressing delivery transformation, geographic barriers, and workforce development builds logically on existing infrastructure and acknowledges what five-year investment can and cannot achieve.

The challenge is magnitude. Governor Pritzker's acknowledgment that RHTP funding is "far from enough" to offset Medicaid cuts represents unusual honesty from a state accepting federal funds. Illinois approaches RHTP as partial compensation rather than comprehensive solution, which may prove more realistic than states treating $50 billion as rural health rescue.

For Illinois' 1.9 million rural residents, RHTP represents meaningful investment that can strengthen regional partnerships, extend telehealth reach, and develop workforce pipelines. **Whether that investment proves transformative depends on policy decisions regarding Medicaid that lie outside RHTP's scope.**

The 86 small and rural hospitals across Illinois will receive support unavailable through other federal programs. Whether the 29.4% operating on negative margins can translate transformation investment into sustainable operations depends less on RHTP design than on whether the Medicaid revenue comprising their financial foundation remains intact.

Illinois has realistic expectations. That realism may prove more valuable than transformation optimism if Medicaid cuts materialize as projected and rural healthcare transformation becomes rural healthcare stabilization, or rural healthcare managed decline.
