# RHTP 3.PA: Pennsylvania

## Coal Country Crossroads: Appalachia's Eastern Anchor Confronts Transformation

Pennsylvania received **$193 million in FY2026 RHTP funding**, ranking 34th nationally among all state awards. The Commonwealth requested $200 million annually across the five-year program, projecting **$1 billion in total RHTP investment** from FY2026 through FY2030. While the actual first-year award fell slightly below projections, Pennsylvania's comprehensive Rural Health Transformation Plan reflects extensive stakeholder engagement and positions the state as a potential model for regional collaborative approaches to rural healthcare transformation.

The funding arrives at a consequential moment. Pennsylvania's rural health infrastructure faces compounding pressures from workforce shortages, population decline, and looming Medicaid cuts that threaten to destabilize hospitals already operating on thin margins. With the **third-largest rural population in the nation** and 48 of 67 counties classified as rural, Pennsylvania's success or failure in deploying RHTP resources will shape outcomes for millions of residents across the Appalachian corridor.

## Rural Health Landscape

**Geographic and Demographic Context**

Pennsylvania's 48 rural counties span **75 percent of the state's land area** while containing approximately **3.37 million residents**, roughly 26 percent of the Commonwealth's 13 million population. Only Texas and North Carolina exceed Pennsylvania's rural population in absolute terms. This scale creates both challenges and opportunities for transformation. The Commonwealth's rural population is not a marginal constituency requiring targeted intervention but a substantial portion of the state requiring system-level reform.

The Center for Rural Pennsylvania defines rural counties as those with population density below 291 persons per square mile, the statewide average. By this measure, rural Pennsylvania encompasses communities ranging from the Northern Tier along the New York border through the Allegheny Mountains of central Pennsylvania to the southwestern counties bordering West Virginia and Ohio. Only Delaware and Philadelphia counties have no rural population whatsoever.

**Population dynamics present particular concern.** Rural Pennsylvania's population declined approximately 2 percent from 2010 to 2020, a trend projected to continue. In 47 of Pennsylvania's 48 rural counties, deaths exceeded births in 2022. This natural population decline compounds outmigration of working-age residents, leaving an aging population requiring more healthcare services while the workforce capable of providing those services shrinks. By 2040, 56 of Pennsylvania's 67 counties will have more residents over 65 than under 20.

The aging trajectory directly impacts healthcare demand and delivery. In 2023, **21 percent of rural Pennsylvania's population was 65 or older**, compared to 18 percent in urban areas. Rural seniors increased 23 percent from 2010 to 2023. This demographic shift creates predictable demand for chronic disease management, long-term care, and emergency services even as the healthcare workforce capable of meeting that demand diminishes.

**Healthcare Access Disparities**

Rural Pennsylvania's healthcare access challenges manifest across multiple dimensions. **Primary care physician density** in rural counties stands at one physician per 1,395 residents, nearly double the urban ratio of one per 788 residents. This disparity means rural residents face longer waits for appointments, travel greater distances for care, and often rely on emergency departments for conditions that urban residents address through primary care relationships.

**Maternity care access** has deteriorated significantly. Five rural Pennsylvania counties now qualify as maternity care deserts, with no obstetric services available within reasonable travel distances. The broader trend toward obstetric unit closures mirrors patterns across Appalachia, where low birth volumes, liability costs, and workforce shortages combine to make maternity services financially unsustainable for small rural hospitals.

**Pharmacy access** presents another critical gap. Approximately **27 percent of rural Pennsylvania residents live in pharmacy deserts**, limiting access to medications and pharmaceutical consultation. For residents managing chronic conditions requiring regular medication refills, these gaps translate into increased travel burden, potential medication non-adherence, and worse health outcomes.

**Behavioral health access** remains severely constrained. The entire Northern Tier and substantial portions of central Pennsylvania are designated Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas. Access to psychiatrists and clinical psychologists in rural areas is approximately half that of urban areas. The opioid crisis has intensified demand for substance use disorder treatment precisely in regions least equipped to provide it.

**Hospital Financial Fragility**

Pennsylvania's rural hospitals operate under significant financial stress. The Pennsylvania Rural Health Model, a CMS Innovation Center demonstration testing global hospital budgets, has provided some stabilization for participating facilities since 2019. However, recent evaluation found **mixed evidence** that participating hospitals' finances meaningfully improved relative to non-participants.

**Tyler Memorial Hospital** in Tunkhannock closed in 2021, demonstrating the immediate community impact of rural hospital failure. Endless Mountains Health System, a nearby facility, saw emergency department visits surge from an average of 22 daily to 38-40 overnight following the closure. This pattern of "bystander hospital" stress following closures strains remaining facilities while simultaneously removing healthcare infrastructure from communities.

State officials project **approximately 25 rural hospitals** may close over the next several years if Medicaid cuts proceed as enacted. This represents roughly one-third of Pennsylvania's rural hospitals. The projected closures would create cascading effects: longer emergency transport times, departing physicians, economic decline, and population loss as residents relocate closer to remaining healthcare facilities.

**Medicaid Dependency and Vulnerability**

Pennsylvania expanded Medicaid in 2015, extending coverage to adults with incomes below 138 percent of the federal poverty level. Approximately **737,000 rural Pennsylvanians depend on Medicaid** for healthcare coverage, making the program foundational to rural healthcare access and hospital financial viability.

The Medicaid cuts enacted through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act create direct threats to this foundation. Provider tax reductions scheduled to phase in by 2028, combined with new work requirements projected to cause coverage losses for approximately 300,000 Pennsylvanians, will reduce hospital revenue while potentially increasing uncompensated care. The RHTP funding, while substantial, cannot offset these structural losses.

**Appalachian Context**

Pennsylvania's rural health challenges exist within the broader Appalachian regional crisis. The state's western and central counties form the northeastern anchor of Appalachia, sharing demographic patterns, economic histories, and health outcomes with West Virginia, eastern Kentucky, and eastern Ohio. The coal and steel economies that once sustained these communities have contracted for decades, leaving populations that are older, poorer, and sicker than state or national averages.

Appalachian Pennsylvania demonstrates elevated rates of **diseases of despair** including opioid overdose, alcohol-related conditions, and suicide. Penn State researchers have documented how rural hospital closures in this region amplify these problems, as reduced access to care allows treatable conditions to become crises. The interconnection between hospital access and population health means that RHTP investments cannot be evaluated solely on facility-level metrics but must account for broader community health trajectories.

## RHTP Award and Funding Position

**Funding Analysis**

Pennsylvania's **$193 million FY2026 award** breaks down into the baseline allocation shared equally among all states ($100 million) plus **$93 million in workload funding** based on state-specific factors including rural population, facility status, and application scoring.

The workload component reflects Pennsylvania's large rural population but also suggests the application scored below states that received substantially higher awards. Texas received $281 million, Alaska $272 million, California $234 million, Montana $234 million, and Oklahoma $224 million as the top five recipients. Pennsylvania's 34th-place ranking among 50 states positions it in the lower half of recipients despite having the third-largest rural population nationally.

**Per capita analysis reveals the scale penalty effect.** With 3.37 million rural residents, Pennsylvania's $193 million translates to approximately **$57 per rural resident annually**. This compares unfavorably to states with smaller rural populations receiving similar or larger absolute awards. Montana, with roughly 550,000 rural residents, receives approximately $425 per rural resident from its $234 million award. Wyoming, with 370,000 rural residents, achieves even more favorable per-capita funding.

The per-capita disparity reflects the RHTP formula's dual structure: equal baseline funding regardless of population combined with workload factors that do not scale proportionally to population size. Large rural states like Pennsylvania, Texas, and California systematically receive less per rural resident than small rural states, even when absolute dollar figures appear substantial.

**Five-Year Projections**

Pennsylvania requested $200 million annually for five years, totaling $1 billion. Based on the FY2026 award, actual five-year funding will likely approximate **$965 million** assuming consistent annual allocations. However, CMS has indicated that funding levels may be adjusted based on implementation performance and policy compliance, creating uncertainty about out-year projections.

The gap between requested and awarded funding, while modest in percentage terms, requires prioritization among proposed initiatives. Some programs that appeared in the application as funded activities may need to be scaled back or delayed pending performance-based funding increases in subsequent years.

## Implementation Strategy

**Regional Care Collaborative Model**

Pennsylvania's RHTP implementation centers on establishing **eight Regional Care Collaboratives (RCCs)** through the state's Partnerships for Regional Economic Performance (PREP) organizations. This approach leverages existing regional infrastructure for economic development coordination rather than creating new healthcare-specific governance structures.

The eight regions correspond to established PREP boundaries: Central, South Central, Southern Alleghenies, Southwest, Northwest, North Central, Northern Tier, and Northeast. Each RCC will convene community and health system partners to prioritize local needs, coordinate service delivery, and direct RHTP resources toward regionally identified priorities.

This structure offers advantages over centralized state-directed implementation. Regional stakeholders possess granular knowledge of local healthcare assets, gaps, and community preferences. Economic development organizations bring established relationships with local governments, employers, and educational institutions that healthcare-focused entities might lack. The model also distributes administrative burden across multiple entities rather than concentrating it within state health agencies.

**However, the regional model creates coordination challenges.** Eight distinct RCCs must align with statewide goals while pursuing regional priorities. Variation in regional capacity, stakeholder engagement quality, and healthcare infrastructure will produce uneven implementation across the state. Some regions may execute effectively while others struggle, creating disparities in how RHTP benefits reach communities.

**Key Subawardees**

Pennsylvania's application identifies primary subawardees positioned to receive RHTP funding:

**Pennsylvania Area Health Education Center (AHEC)**: Workforce pipeline development, clinical rotation coordination, and recruitment support across rural regions. AHEC's existing network and relationships with educational institutions position it as a natural lead for workforce initiatives.

**University of Pittsburgh Medicaid Research Center**: Data analytics, program evaluation, and evidence generation for RHTP initiatives. The research partnership provides capacity for measuring outcomes and identifying effective practices for potential scaling.

**PREP Regional Organizations**: Administrative coordination, stakeholder convening, and regional priority-setting as RCC hosts. These organizations receive administrative funding to support collaborative governance.

**Rural Hospitals and Health Systems**: Direct recipients for facility-based investments, technology infrastructure, and service delivery initiatives. Specific allocations pending RCC priority-setting and state administrative processes.

**Priority Focus Areas**

Pennsylvania's RHTP addresses CMS goals through five integrated priority areas:

**Technology and Infrastructure**: Consumer-facing applications supporting access to primary and specialty care, electronic health record integration, telehealth expansion, and digital infrastructure development. The 12 percent of rural households lacking internet access presents a barrier to technology-dependent solutions that the plan must address.

**Workforce Development**: Upfront scholarships, mentoring programs, short-term housing, and stipends conditioned on five-year rural service commitments. The plan emphasizes full-spectrum workforce development from allied health through physicians, with particular attention to nursing, behavioral health, and dental workforce gaps. Notable innovations include the **surgical obstetric fellowship for family medicine physicians** and partnership with **Indiana University of Pennsylvania's new College of Osteopathic Medicine** as rural-focused physician training pipeline.

**Maternal Health Services**: Comprehensive care management from preconception through 12 months postpartum, integrating prenatal care, behavioral health, and support services. The rural maternal health hub model positions hospitals as anchor institutions coordinating community-based organizations and specialty providers.

**Behavioral Health Services**: Expansion of 988 crisis services, public education on crisis response, integrated behavioral health in primary care settings, and substance use disorder treatment capacity. The behavioral health focus responds to workforce shortages and elevated disease-of-despair rates in rural Pennsylvania.

**Rapid Response Access Stabilization Grants**: Initial funding tranche to support existing community health initiatives while RCCs establish governance structures. These grants provide bridge funding for work already underway rather than requiring communities to wait for new program development.

## Social Care Integration

**SDOH and HRSN Framework**

Pennsylvania's RHTP application emphasizes healthcare delivery system transformation more than explicit social determinants of health infrastructure development. The regional collaborative model creates potential pathways for social care integration through PREP organizations' existing economic development relationships, but specific SDOH programming and funding allocations remain underdeveloped relative to some other state applications.

**Community Health Workers**: The application references community-based organization partnerships within maternal health hubs but does not specify dedicated CHW workforce development funding or standardized training programs. This gap may limit the social care integration potential of clinical transformation efforts.

**Community Information Exchange**: No specific CIE platform vendor or procurement timeline appears in Pennsylvania's public-facing application materials. The technology and infrastructure focus addresses clinical data integration through EHR systems but does not explicitly address social service referral networks.

**Food Is Medicine**: Pennsylvania is identified among states incorporating Food Is Medicine strategies, though detailed programming and funding allocations are not specified in available documentation.

| Component | Status | Funding | Survival Likelihood |
|-----------|--------|---------|---------------------|
| CHW Programs | Implicit | Not specified | Moderate |
| CIE Platform | Not specified | Not allocated | Low |
| Food Programs | Referenced | Not detailed | Moderate |
| Housing Support | Not addressed | Not allocated | Low |
| Transportation | Not addressed | Not allocated | Low |

**Partial Funding Impact**

The gap between requested ($200M) and awarded ($193M) funding in FY2026 creates pressure on all program components. Social care elements, which often lack the political salience of hospital stabilization or workforce recruitment, face particular vulnerability to de-prioritization as RCCs allocate limited resources.

If Pennsylvania receives consistently lower-than-requested funding across the five-year program, social care integration components are likely first-cut items. Healthcare delivery transformation that can demonstrate direct clinical outcomes will receive priority over upstream interventions whose benefits manifest over longer timeframes and through indirect causal pathways.

## Implementation Context

**Political Environment**

Governor Josh Shapiro's administration has positioned rural health as a policy priority, dedicating substantial interagency coordination to RHTP application development. The Pennsylvania Departments of Human Services, Health, Aging, Insurance, and Drug and Alcohol Programs collaborated on the application, reflecting whole-of-government approach to rural health challenges.

**However, Pennsylvania's divided government** creates implementation uncertainty. The Democratic governor faces a Republican-controlled legislature that may not share administration priorities. Budget negotiations for state match funding, enabling legislation for new programs, and workforce policy reforms require legislative cooperation that cannot be assumed.

The RHTP's federal origin under Republican congressional leadership may paradoxically create bipartisan support for implementation. Rural health infrastructure serves constituencies across partisan lines, and federal funding that arrives regardless of state political choices creates opportunities that legislators may be reluctant to forgo.

**State Capacity**

Pennsylvania's state health agencies possess substantial technical capacity relative to many other states. The Department of Human Services administers one of the nation's larger Medicaid programs. The Department of Health maintains public health infrastructure across the state. Prior experience with the Pennsylvania Rural Health Model provides implementation learning that can inform RHTP execution.

The regional collaborative structure distributes implementation burden but also introduces coordination complexity. State agencies must provide oversight, technical assistance, and accountability mechanisms for eight distinct RCCs while allowing regional flexibility. This balance between central coordination and regional autonomy will determine whether the collaborative model produces synergies or fragmentation.

**Stakeholder Engagement History**

Pennsylvania's two-year stakeholder engagement process preceding RHTP application represents genuine investment in community input. Regional rural health summits, listening sessions, and open feedback mechanisms generated over 300 stakeholder responses that informed application priorities.

This engagement creates both opportunity and expectation. Communities that participated in priority-setting processes expect to see their input reflected in funded activities. If RCC governance structures do not include meaningful community representation, or if state-level decisions override regional priorities, stakeholder trust developed through engagement may dissipate.

## Critical Analysis

**Strengths**

Pennsylvania's RHTP approach demonstrates several notable strengths:

**Regional infrastructure leverage**: Building on existing PREP organizations rather than creating new structures accelerates implementation while grounding healthcare transformation in broader economic development context. Rural communities need jobs and economic vitality alongside healthcare access; integrating these concerns through regional coordinators may produce more sustainable outcomes than healthcare-isolated approaches.

**Workforce pipeline innovation**: Partnerships with IUP's new osteopathic medical school and development of family medicine obstetric fellowships address specific rural workforce gaps through training pipeline investments rather than solely through recruitment incentives. Training rural-oriented providers may prove more sustainable than competing for mobile providers through loan repayment and signing bonuses.

**Prior model experience**: The Pennsylvania Rural Health Model provides implementation learning about global budgets, hospital transformation planning, and multi-payer coordination that other states lack. Pennsylvania can build on what worked and avoid repeating what did not.

**Stakeholder process depth**: Extensive community engagement produces plans aligned with local priorities and creates constituent expectations that can drive implementation accountability.

**Challenges**

Significant challenges confront Pennsylvania's RHTP implementation:

**Scale penalty economics**: Pennsylvania's $57 per rural resident funding level provides substantially less per-person investment than smaller states receive. Transforming healthcare for 3.37 million people requires resources proportional to population, but the RHTP formula does not provide them.

**Medicaid offset impossibility**: The $193 million annual RHTP award cannot offset projected Medicaid losses affecting rural Pennsylvania hospitals. The structural fiscal crisis exceeds RHTP resources by an order of magnitude. Transformation efforts occur against a backdrop of deteriorating hospital finances that RHTP cannot reverse.

**Regional coordination complexity**: Eight RCCs pursuing regional priorities with varying capacity, stakeholder engagement quality, and healthcare infrastructure create implementation variance that may produce uneven results. Some regions may thrive while others struggle, creating new disparities even as the program attempts to address existing ones.

**Social care underdevelopment**: The application's healthcare delivery focus leaves social determinants of health infrastructure underfunded and underspecified. Without explicit social care integration mechanisms, clinical transformation may not address upstream factors driving rural health disparities.

**Political uncertainty**: Divided state government creates implementation risk for initiatives requiring legislative action, budget appropriations, or regulatory changes that exceed executive authority.

**2030 Sustainability Question**

Pennsylvania's RHTP builds transformation capacity across a five-year federal funding horizon. The critical question concerns what survives when RHTP funding ends in 2030.

**Sustainable elements**: Workforce pipeline investments that increase rural provider supply create lasting capacity independent of ongoing federal funding. Training programs that graduate rural-committed physicians, nurses, and allied health professionals generate returns for decades. Technology infrastructure investments in EHR integration and telehealth capacity persist beyond funding periods.

**Vulnerable elements**: Programs requiring ongoing operational funding, including workforce recruitment incentives, direct hospital support, and expanded service capacity, face sustainability challenges without RHTP continuation or alternative funding sources. RCC coordination structures that depend on RHTP administrative funding may not survive program conclusion.

**Pennsylvania's Medicaid expansion status** provides some sustainability foundation. Unlike non-expansion states where RHTP creates access that Medicaid cuts simultaneously undermine, Pennsylvania can potentially sustain coverage gains if federal Medicaid policy stabilizes. However, the magnitude of enacted Medicaid cuts threatens even expansion-state stability.

## Conclusion

Pennsylvania's RHTP implementation represents a substantial but constrained opportunity for rural health transformation. The $193 million annual award brings meaningful resources to communities facing genuine healthcare access crises. The regional collaborative model, workforce pipeline focus, and stakeholder engagement foundation create potential for effective deployment.

Yet the scale penalty effect, Medicaid fiscal context, and social care underdevelopment limit what RHTP can achieve. Pennsylvania cannot transform healthcare for 3.37 million rural residents on $57 per person annually while simultaneously absorbing structural Medicaid losses exceeding RHTP resources by an order of magnitude.

The Commonwealth's success will depend on whether regional collaboratives effectively prioritize investments, whether workforce pipeline efforts produce providers willing to practice in rural communities, and whether state fiscal policy supports rather than undermines healthcare infrastructure. Pennsylvania has the capacity, stakeholder commitment, and institutional foundation to execute RHTP effectively within program constraints. Whether those constraints permit genuine transformation or merely slow decline remains the open question.
