# Research Strategy: Filling 3-TD-E Information Gaps

*Rural Health Transformation Project*
*January 2026*

## Gap Inventory Summary

The 3-TD-E document contains **systematic information gaps across four primary categories**:

### Category 1: Standard State SDOH Assessment (32 States Unknown)

States with complete data gaps in the Standard States Summary table:

**Northeast:** PA, NY, NJ, MA, CT, RI, DE, MD, ME, NH

**Midwest:** MI, MN, IN, IL, KS, NE, SD

**Southeast:** SC, LA, FL

**West/Southwest:** AZ, CO, NM, WY, ID, UT, NV, AK, HI

### Category 2: CHW Program Details

**Missing FTE targets** for: MS, OK, WV, KY (all Priority States)

**Missing training pipeline** information for: MS, AL, AR

**Missing employer models** for: MS, AL, AR

**Standard states with no CHW data:** 43 states lack any CHW program documentation

### Category 3: CIE Platform Status

**Unknown platform status:** MS, AL, AR (Priority States)

**No procurement information:** TX, OH, GA (despite large rural populations)

**Missing vendor information:** Multiple states with fragmented platforms

### Category 4: Funding Specifics

**"Not specified" or "Unknown" entries** for funding amounts across multiple states and components

## Research Source Strategy

### Tier 1: Official Government Sources (Highest Priority)

**State Health Department RHTP Pages**

Every state health department maintains RHTP implementation documentation. **Systematic URL pattern:**

```
[state].gov/health/rhtp
[state].gov/healthandhumanservices/rural-health-transformation
[state]dhhs.gov/rhtp
```

**Action:** Create state-by-state URL inventory and check for:
- Implementation plans
- Budget breakdowns
- Stakeholder presentations
- Award announcements
- Provider bulletins

**CMS RHTP Technical Assistance Resources**

CMS maintains state-specific materials through the RHTP Technical Assistance Center. Access via:
- CMS.gov Rural Health Transformation Program hub
- State implementation webinar recordings
- Technical assistance request documentation

**State Medicaid Agency Publications**

For SDOH/HRSN integration:
- Section 1115 waiver applications and approvals
- State Plan Amendments (SPAs) for CHW reimbursement
- Managed care contract requirements (RFPs and executed contracts)

**Primary Research Actions:**
1. Search each Unknown state's Medicaid agency site for "SDOH," "social determinants," "community health worker"
2. Review recently approved 1115 waivers for HRSN/SDOH provisions
3. Check MCO contract templates for social care requirements

### Tier 2: Trade and Professional Publications

**Healthcare Trade Press**

**State Hospital Associations**

Each state hospital association often participates in RHTP planning and publishes implementation updates:

```
[state]hospital.org
[state]ha.org
[state]hospitals.org
```

**Rural Health Associations**

| Organization | Value |
|--------------|-------|
| **NRHA State Affiliates** | State-specific rural health priorities |
| **State Offices of Rural Health** | RHTP coordination updates |
| **FORHP Grantee Network** | Federal rural health program integration |

### Tier 4: Freedom of Information Requests

For states with **persistent information gaps** after Tiers 1-3, consider FOIA/public records requests:

**Request Templates:**

1. **RHTP Application:** "Complete application submitted to CMS for Rural Health Transformation Program funding, including all appendices and budget narratives"

2. **Implementation Plan:** "Current RHTP implementation plan, including initiative descriptions, timeline, and budget allocation by program area"

3. **Subawardee List:** "List of all organizations receiving RHTP subawards, including award amounts and program descriptions"

**High-Value FOIA Targets:**
- Mississippi (complete information gap)
- Arkansas (complete information gap)
- Alabama (significant gaps)
- Texas (subawardee details)

## Prioritized Research Protocol

### Phase 1: Priority State Gap Filling (Week 1)

**Objective:** Complete gaps for 12 Priority States first

| State | Primary Gap | Research Source |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Mississippi** | All categories | State health department, FOIA |
| **Arkansas** | All categories | State health department, FOIA |
| **Alabama** | CIE, CHW details | State health department |
| **Oklahoma** | Funding specifics | State health department |
| **Ohio** | CHW FTE, funding | State Medicaid agency |

**Search Queries per State:**

```
"[State] Rural Health Transformation Program implementation"
"[State] RHTP social determinants"
"[State] community health worker Medicaid reimbursement"
"[State] community information exchange"
"[State] HRSN screening program"
```

### Phase 2: Standard State Sweep (Weeks 2-3)

**Objective:** Populate Standard States table for all 38 states

**Batch Processing Approach:**

Group states by **regional health policy similarity** for efficient research:

**Batch A: Medicaid Expansion States with Likely SDOH Programs**
- PA, NY, NJ, MA, CT, RI, DE, MD, ME, NH, MI, MN, IL, CO, NM, NV, HI

**Research assumption:** These states likely have SDOH infrastructure via Medicaid managed care requirements

**Batch B: Non-Expansion States with Minimal Expected Infrastructure**
- SC, FL (non-expansion with large rural populations)
- KS, NE, SD, WY, ID, UT (conservative policy environments)

**Research assumption:** Less likely to have robust social care integration

**Batch C: States with Known Infrastructure (Verification)**
- AZ (AHCCCS managed care has SDOH requirements)
- LA (Healthy Louisiana MCO contracts)
- IN (HIP waiver provisions)

### Phase 3: Cross-Validation (Week 4)

**Objective:** Verify findings through secondary sources

**Validation Sources:**

1. **NASHP State Health Policy Tracker** - verify CHW certification status
2. **KFF Medicaid Managed Care Contract Tracker** - verify MCO SDOH requirements
3. **Vendor announcements** - verify CIE platform deployments
4. **State Medicaid Director Association** - verify waiver provisions

## Data Collection Template

For each state, collect the following structured information:

### SDOH/HRSN Assessment

```

## Web Search Strategy

### Efficient Query Construction

**Primary Query Patterns:**

```
site:gov "[State] RHTP implementation"
site:gov "[State] community health worker Medicaid"
site:gov "[State] social determinants health Medicaid"
"[State] Rural Health Transformation" filetype:pdf
"[State] HRSN screening" 2025 OR 2026
```

**Platform-Specific Queries:**

```
site:unite-us.com "[State]"
site:findhelp.org "[State]"
"[State] community information exchange" contract award
```

**CHW-Specific Queries:**

```
"[State] CHW certification" requirements
"[State] community health worker" Medicaid reimbursement SPA
site:nashp.org "[State]" community health worker
```

### Results Processing Protocol

1. **Capture URL and access date** for every source
2. **Extract specific data points** rather than general descriptions
3. **Note information currency** (when was the source published?)
4. **Flag contradictory information** for reconciliation
5. **Document "confirmed absent"** versus "not found"

## Expected Outcomes

### Realistic Coverage Targets

| Category | Current Coverage | Target Coverage | Confidence |
|----------|------------------|-----------------|------------|
| **Priority States (12)** | ~60% | 95% | High |
| **Standard States SDOH** | ~15% | 70% | Moderate |
| **CHW Programs** | ~20% | 60% | Moderate |
| **CIE Platforms** | ~30% | 75% | High |

### Irreducible Gaps

Some information gaps will persist due to:

1. **States that genuinely excluded social care** - no data to find
2. **States with unpublished implementation plans** - FOIA timeline constraints
3. **Embedded components** - difficult to separate from clinical initiatives
4. **Real-time evolution** - implementation decisions ongoing

**Document "confirmed absent" separately from "unknown"** to distinguish deliberate exclusion from research gaps.

## Resource Requirements

### Time Estimate

| Phase | Duration | Effort |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **Phase 1:** Priority States | 5 days | 20 hours |
| **Phase 2:** Standard States | 10 days | 40 hours |
| **Phase 3:** Cross-Validation | 5 days | 15 hours |
| **Total** | 4 weeks | 75 hours |

### Tool Requirements

1. **Web search** with date filtering capability
2. **PDF text extraction** for state documents
3. **Structured data collection** (spreadsheet or database)
4. **Source management** for MLA9 citation generation

## Implementation Recommendation

**Recommended Approach:** Execute research in collaborative sessions where Claude performs systematic web searches while you provide guidance on source credibility and prioritization.

**Session Structure:**
- Select 5-8 states per session
- Run standardized queries for each state
- Extract structured data into template
- Flag gaps requiring FOIA or follow-up
- Update 3-TD-E document with verified information

This **incremental approach** ensures quality while making progress visible, and allows adjustment based on what sources prove most productive.
