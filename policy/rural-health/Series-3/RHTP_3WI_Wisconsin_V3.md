# RHTP 3.WI: Wisconsin
## The Right Providers, the Right Technology, the Right Networks

*Series 3: State Implementation*

Wisconsin received **$203.7 million in FY2026 RHTP funding**, ranking 23rd among all 50 state awards. The allocation positions Wisconsin slightly above the national average of $200 million, reflecting the state's substantial rural population and robust healthcare infrastructure despite lacking the extreme rural dispersal that benefited states like Wyoming or Montana.

The state's vision statement captures the transformation approach: "the right providers, empowered by the right technology, and supported by the right networks." Wisconsin requested **$1 billion over five years** and may receive up to $18 million above that request according to CMS staff, positioning the dairy state's rural health system for unprecedented federal investment.

## Rural Health Landscape

### State Context

Wisconsin spans **65,496 square miles** across 72 counties, with the northern two-thirds of the state comprising predominantly rural territory. The Department of Health Services identifies **2.14 million Wisconsinites living in rural census tracts**, representing **36.3% of the state's 5.9 million population**. Rural Wisconsin covers 82% of the state's total land area but maintains only 48 people per square mile compared to 388 in urban areas.

| Metric | Rural Wisconsin | Urban Wisconsin |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Population | 2.14 million (36.3%) | 3.75 million (63.7%) |
| Land Area | 44,496 sq mi (82.1%) | 9,672 sq mi (17.9%) |
| Population Density | 48.1/sq mi | 388.0/sq mi |
| Median Household Income | $74,700 | $81,800 |
| Uninsured Rate | 6% | 5% |

Rural Wisconsin exhibits the income and insurance disparities common to agricultural economies. The $7,100 gap in median household income between rural and urban areas compounds over time, affecting families' ability to absorb healthcare costs and travel expenses. The higher rural uninsured rate persists despite Wisconsin's unique Medicaid structure that eliminates the coverage gap present in other non-expansion states.

Employment patterns reveal rural Wisconsin's economic foundation. **Manufacturing employs 20% of rural workers** compared to 17% in urban areas, while the agricultural sector concentrates almost exclusively in rural counties. The combination of manufacturing and agricultural employment creates occupational health challenges including machinery injuries, respiratory conditions, and chemical exposures that strain healthcare systems designed for lower-acuity populations.

### Geographic Distribution

Wisconsin designates 32 counties as rural and 40 as semi-rural for RHTP purposes:

**Rural Counties (32):** Adams, Ashland, Barron, Buffalo, Burnett, Clark, Crawford, Florence, Forest, Green Lake, Iron, Jackson, Juneau, Lafayette, Langlade, Lincoln, Marinette, Marquette, Menominee, Monroe, Oneida, Pepin, Polk, Portage, Price, Richland, Rusk, Sawyer, Taylor, Vilas, Washburn, Wood

**Semi-Rural Counties (40):** Including Bayfield, Brown, Calumet, Chippewa, Columbia, Dane, Dodge, Door, Douglas, Dunn, Eau Claire, Fond du Lac, Grant, Green, Iowa, Jefferson, and others surrounding the Milwaukee metropolitan area.

Northern Wisconsin presents the most acute access challenges. Residents in counties like Florence, Forest, and Iron face **travel times exceeding 60 minutes for emergency care** and limited specialty access. The application notes that two-thirds of rural residents must travel more than 30 minutes to access emergency care, with 35% traveling over 60 minutes for emergency services.

### Healthcare Infrastructure

Wisconsin maintains substantial rural healthcare infrastructure relative to population:

| Facility Type | Total | Semi-Rural | Rural |
|---------------|-------|------------|-------|
| FQHCs/Community Health Centers | 280 | 156 (55%) | 80 (28%) |
| Critical Access Hospitals | 60 | 32 (53%) | 28 (46%) |
| Rural Health Clinics | 217 | 105 (48%) | 112 (51%) |
| Free and Charitable Clinics | 102 | 72 (70%) | 8 (7%) |
| Tribal Clinics | 14 | 4 (28%) | 9 (64%) |
| Opioid Treatment Facilities | 31 | 22 (70%) | 0 (0%) |
| Local and Tribal Health Departments | 84 | 43 (51%) | 31 (36%) |
| EMS Agencies | 762 | 84% rural or semi-rural |

The **60 Critical Access Hospitals** anchor emergency and inpatient care across rural Wisconsin. Notably, 11 received recognition in the 2025 HRSA Medicare Beneficiary Quality Improvement Project for quality reporting and performance, ranking Wisconsin's CAHs among the top 10 nationally. The **Wisconsin Office of Rural Health Flex Program** supports CAH quality improvement, financial improvement, and operational activities.

The **absence of opioid treatment facilities in fully rural counties** creates a treatment desert for substance use disorders. The 31 existing facilities concentrate in semi-rural and urban areas, forcing rural residents to travel substantial distances for medication-assisted treatment.

### The 2024 Hospital Closures

The fragility of Wisconsin's rural healthcare infrastructure became starkly visible in January 2024 when **Hospital Sisters Health System (HSHS) announced complete withdrawal from western Wisconsin**. The closures included:

**Sacred Heart Hospital** in Eau Claire, serving patients since the 1880s
**St. Joseph's Hospital** in Chippewa Falls
**19 Prevea Health clinics** across the Chippewa Valley

The closures eliminated emergency rooms, hospital beds, and critical care units while devastating behavioral health services in the region. Sacred Heart had provided **inpatient and outpatient behavioral health services** that no other facility in the immediate area could absorb. Over 1,000 healthcare workers lost employment.

Even a $15 million state appropriation for behavioral health services could not save the facilities. Wisconsin Hospital Association President Eric Borgerding noted that "even with the $15 million in one-time funding, they could not afford to operate the services there." The facilities' payor mix of two-thirds Medicare and Medicaid proved unsustainable under current reimbursement rates.

The closures provided visceral context for Wisconsin's RHTP application. DHS Secretary Kirsten Johnson explicitly referenced the closure impact: "In 2024, two hospitals closed in adjoining counties, leaving patients to find new providers and other facilities to absorb patients."

### Health Professional Shortages

Wisconsin faces workforce gaps across multiple provider categories:

| Designation Type | Affected Counties |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Mental Health Professional Shortage | 40 of 72 counties |
| Primary Care Shortage | 37 of 72 counties |
| Dental Care Shortage | 34 of 72 counties |

The **56% of counties designated as mental health shortage areas** creates cascading effects. Rural residents experience higher suicide rates (17.0 versus 14.2 deaths per 100,000), higher self-harm injury rates in emergency departments, and fewer depression screenings during primary care visits. Rural men over age 25 face particularly elevated suicide risk, especially during summer months when agricultural stress peaks.

The **Wisconsin Governor's Task Force on the Healthcare Workforce** documented recruitment and retention challenges in its 2024 report. Rural communities struggle to attract providers due to geographic isolation, limited family-supporting services, and technology gaps that create administrative burdens. Students who train in rural settings demonstrate higher likelihood of practicing rurally, but connecting students to rural training opportunities remains difficult.

### Health Outcomes

Rural Wisconsin exhibits the chronic disease burden common to agricultural states:

| Condition | Rural Impact |
|-----------|--------------|
| Heart Disease Mortality (35+) | 335.5 vs 324.2 deaths/100,000 (rural vs urban) |
| Cardiac Arrest Ambulance Runs | 14.3 vs 12.3 per 10,000 (rural vs urban) |
| Diabetes Prevalence | ~9% statewide |
| Suicide Rate | 17.0 vs 14.2 deaths/100,000 (rural vs urban) |
| Self-Harm ED Visits | 64.8 vs 51.8 per 100,000 (rural vs urban) |

Prenatal care disparities compound maternal health risks. Only **75% of rural mothers received first-trimester prenatal care** compared to 78% in urban counties. Severe maternal morbidity reached 77.9 per 10,000 delivery hospitalizations in 2023, with pregnancy-related overdose deaths emerging as the leading cause of pregnancy-related death.

**Farmer mental health** presents particular urgency. Surveys indicate 80% of farmers report financial issues impacting mental health, 82% cite weather or factors beyond their control, and 80% identify farm economy concerns. Wisconsin Farm Bureau and the Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection operate farmer wellness programs, but coverage remains limited.

## RHTP Award and Context

| Metric | Wisconsin | National Context |
|--------|-----------|------------------|
| FY2026 Award | $203.7 million | Average: $200 million |
| Award Rank | 23rd of 50 | Range: $147M to $281M |
| Five-Year Projection | ~$1 billion | Based on CMS guidance |
| Rural Population | 2.14 million | 36.3% of state |
| Per-Capita (Rural) | ~$95 | Below many smaller states |
| CAHs | 60 | Second-tier density |

### Formula Position

Wisconsin's position near the national average reflects offsetting formula factors:

**Favorable:** Substantial rural population (2.14 million), extensive CAH network (60), strong application with specific initiatives, Medicaid structure eliminating coverage gap

**Unfavorable:** Population density higher than frontier states, moderate rurality scores compared to Northern Plains states, lack of Medicaid expansion limits scoring on coverage factors

The **$95 per-capita rural funding** falls below frontier states like Wyoming ($554) or Montana ($234) but exceeds dense states where rural populations represent smaller shares. Wisconsin cannot achieve the per-resident investment intensity of smaller states, but the absolute funding level enables statewide program implementation.

### Medicaid Context

Wisconsin represents **the only non-expansion state without a coverage gap**. Under the BadgerCare Plus structure established by former Governor Scott Walker:

**Adults up to 100% FPL:** Covered through BadgerCare Plus waiver
**Adults 100% to 138% FPL:** Access premium tax credits in the Marketplace (unlike other non-expansion states)
**Childless Adults:** 198,000 enrolled as of January 2025

This unique structure means Wisconsin's rural residents have coverage pathways unavailable in other non-expansion states like Texas or Georgia. However, the state forgoes approximately **$1.9 billion in federal matching funds** that full Medicaid expansion would provide, while paying a higher state share (39.9%) for the waiver population than the 10% state share expansion states pay.

Governor Evers has proposed Medicaid expansion in four consecutive biennial budgets, with Republican legislative majorities blocking each attempt. The Wisconsin Policy Forum estimates expansion would save $1.7 billion over the biennium, including a $1.3 billion federal sign-on bonus.

**Work Requirements:** Federal policy changes beginning January 2027 will require community engagement for Medicaid adults, potentially affecting coverage continuity for rural Wisconsinites already enrolled in BadgerCare Plus.

## State Approach

### Governance Structure

The **Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) Office of Grants Management (OGM)** serves as lead agency. OGM will recruit a dedicated team including:

- **RHTP Program Director**
- Program Managers for policy and grants administration
- Analysts for program development, grants management, data analytics

DHS holds authority over Medicaid, public health, behavioral health, and regulation of hospital and long-term care sectors. The Office of Tribal Affairs and Wisconsin Office of Rural Health provide specialized coordination for Tribal engagement and rural health expertise.

An **external advisory body** will meet at least quarterly, incorporating:
- Rural hospitals and Tribal health centers
- Community health centers
- Primary and behavioral health providers
- Community-based care extenders (CHWs, peer specialists, pharmacists, EMS)
- Higher education partners
- Individuals with lived experience

### Three-Initiative Architecture

Wisconsin's application organizes funding across three interconnected initiatives totaling approximately $944 million over five years:

| Initiative | Allocation | Share |
|------------|------------|-------|
| 1: Rural Talent Recruitment and Retention | $337 million | 36% |
| 2: Interoperability Infrastructure and Modernization | $329 million | 35% |
| 3: Population Health Infrastructure | $278.5 million | 30% |

## Program and Funding Distribution

| Care Coordination Grants | 3 | $230 million | Regional coalitions | Innovative care delivery |
| Tribal Allocations | 3 | $27.5 million | 11 Tribal Nations | $500K/year per nation |
| Medicaid Reforms | 3 | ~$15 million | Wisconsin Medicaid | RHC payment modernization |
| Public Intervenor Services | 3 | $15 million | Office of Insurance Commissioner | Insurance navigation |
| Behavioral Health Innovations | 3 | $5 million | DHS/DCTS | CCBHC study, youth mental health |

## Social Care Integration

| Component | Included | Allocation | Vendor/Operator | Likely Funded |
|-----------|----------|------------|-----------------|---------------|
| SDOH/HRSN Screening | Embedded | Not specified | Care Coordination Grantees | At Risk |
| CHW Programs | Yes | $60 million | Medicaid/Pilot Grantees | Yes |
| CIE Platform | Yes | $4 million | United Way Wisconsin (211) | Yes |
| HIE Infrastructure | Yes | $2 million | WISHIN | Yes |
| Rural Health Care Collaborative | Yes | $85 million | TBD Vendor | Yes |

### Community Health Worker Integration

Wisconsin's CHW initiative represents the **most explicitly sustainable social care investment** in the application. The phased approach includes:

**2026-2027:** Competitive grants for rural facilities to pilot CHW services
**2026-2028:** Independent study of utilization, cost, impact, and ROI
**2028:** Medicaid State Plan Amendment to cover CHW services

The application cites Kentucky's CHW program demonstrating **$11.33 return for every $1 spent** over 25 years, with 10% reduction in ER visits and 23% reduction in inpatient admissions. Wisconsin expects similar returns will encourage private and public payors to cover services.

Three nationally certified CHW training programs operate in Wisconsin, providing virtual and in-person core competency training. The Wisconsin Association of Community Health Workers provides peer-to-peer learning and supervisor development.

### Community Information Exchange

**United Way Wisconsin** operates the 211 system serving as the statewide CIE backbone. RHTP investment will enhance the database of approximately 12,000 agencies, improve closed-loop referral capabilities, and strengthen connections between community-based organizations and clinical providers.

**WISHIN (Wisconsin Statewide Health Information Network)** serves as the state-designated HIE. Investment will improve interoperability between rural providers and support clinical data exchange for the Rural Health Care Collaborative.

### Rural Health Care Collaborative

The **most ambitious technology investment**, the $85 million Rural Health Care Collaborative will create shared digital infrastructure enabling smaller rural providers to:

- Access comprehensive longitudinal patient records
- Deploy chronic disease management tools
- Utilize patient-facing portals
- Access telehealth services and expanded care networks
- Implement closed-loop community service referral networks
- Adopt AI charting, medication management, remote patient monitoring

Technical specifications will be developed with participating providers. Sustainability will be achieved through user fees for ongoing maintenance. DHS projects 60+ providers at 5+ care sites enrolled by Year 4.

**UW Population Health Institute:** Data dashboards, technical assistance for care coordination grantees, county-level health data analysis.

**Wisconsin Collaborative for Healthcare Quality (WCHQ):** Clinical, laboratory, and encounter data repository enabling quality improvement across participating providers.

### Healthcare System Partners

The application references existing partnerships that may receive RHTP funding:

**Wisconsin High-Value Network:** Collaboration of independent hospitals serving 350,000+ people through clinically integrated network with shared payer contracting.

**Mayo Clinic Health System/UW-Eau Claire:** Rural Preventative Health Specialist model operating at five sites, serving 16 counties.

**Children's Wisconsin:** Statewide pediatric specialty system; care coordination grantees may partner for rural pediatric access.

**NorthLakes Community Clinic:** FQHC expanding into western Wisconsin following HSHS closures, demonstrating community-driven clinic recovery.

### Tribal Partners

All **11 federally recognized Tribal Nations** receive $500,000 annually ($27.5 million total) to implement the three Wisconsin RHTP initiatives in their communities:

- Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa
- Ho-Chunk Nation
- Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa
- Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa
- Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin
- Oneida Nation
- Forest County Potawatomi Community
- Red Cliff Band of Lake Superior Chippewa
- St. Croix Chippewa Indians of Wisconsin
- Sokaogon Chippewa Community
- Stockbridge-Munsee Community

Tribal Nations may additionally apply for competitive grants under all three initiatives. The state will assign staff to ensure alignment with CMS-approved goals while respecting government-to-government relationships.

## Assessment

### Strengths

**Sustainability Planning:** Wisconsin's CHW Medicaid SPA pathway creates the clearest post-RHTP funding stream for social care integration in any reviewed application. If successful, CHW services become permanent Medicaid benefits rather than grant-dependent programs.

**Technology Strategy:** The Rural Health Care Collaborative addresses the fundamental interoperability gap preventing coordinated rural care. Smaller providers operating with "bubble gum and duct tape" (per one county cited in the application) cannot individually afford modern systems. Shared infrastructure creates economies of scale.

**Existing Infrastructure:** The 60 CAHs, 217 RHCs, and 280 FQHCs provide implementation platforms that states lacking provider density cannot replicate. Wisconsin can reach rural populations through existing access points rather than building from scratch.

**Quality Recognition:** Wisconsin CAHs rank among the top 10 nationally for HRSA MBQIP performance. The 65% of Wisconsin hospitals earning CMS four or five-star ratings (versus 36% nationally) indicates existing quality foundation for transformation.

**Coverage Structure:** No coverage gap means RHTP investments serve populations who can actually access care. Unlike Texas or Georgia, Wisconsin's rural uninsured rate remains manageable.

**Hospital Investment:** The 2025 state budget provided significant ongoing hospital investment, with a hospital tax increase from 1.8% to 6% generating approximately $1 billion in additional federal matching funds annually.

### Vulnerabilities

**SDOH Specificity:** The application lacks explicit SDOH screening requirements at the provider level. Social care integration depends on care coordination grantee implementation rather than systematic mandates. CHW services are the vehicle, but screening infrastructure receives limited attention.

**Vendor Procurement Risk:** The Rural Health Care Collaborative requires vendor selection for complex shared infrastructure. Implementation timelines (20-40 providers added every six months through 2031) assume procurement proceeds smoothly, which large IT projects rarely do.

**Behavioral Health Capacity:** The CCBHC study is prudent but delays action. While Wisconsin studies how to structure Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics, the behavioral health provider shortage persists. The $5 million behavioral health allocation seems modest relative to documented crisis.

**Hospital Closure Precedent:** The HSHS closures demonstrated that even $15 million in emergency state funding could not sustain facilities with challenging payor mix. RHTP investment cannot solve fundamental hospital economics where two-thirds of patients rely on government programs reimbursing below cost.

**Non-Expansion Trade-offs:** Wisconsin pays 39.9% state share for the BadgerCare waiver population versus 10% under expansion. The $1.9 billion forgone savings over the biennium represents resources unavailable for provider investment, workforce recruitment, or facility support.

**Workforce Competition:** Wisconsin competes with Minnesota (which has expanded Medicaid, offers higher reimbursement, and maintains stronger rural health outcomes) for healthcare workers. Providers can practice across state lines with different payment structures.

### The 2030 Question

Wisconsin's application explicitly addresses sustainability through several mechanisms:

**One-Time Investments:** Educational initiatives, simulation labs, technology purchases, and system upgrades are designed as capital expenditures without ongoing federal dependence.

**User Fee Models:** The Rural Health Care Collaborative will transition to participant-funded maintenance. Facilities accepting technology allocations commit to sustaining operations.

**Medicaid Coverage:** CHW services achieve sustainability through State Plan Amendment rather than ongoing grant funding.

**Partnership Requirements:** Care coordination grantees must demonstrate sustainability paths for proposed projects.

However, fundamental questions remain:

**Can workforce recruited through RHTP training remain in rural Wisconsin without ongoing incentives?** Students may complete training but practice elsewhere if rural economics remain challenging.

**Will technology investments prove sustainable for facilities with difficult payor mix?** Facilities like those HSHS closed operated modern systems but could not generate sufficient revenue.

**Does partial-year CHW pilot (2026-2027) provide sufficient evidence for Medicaid SPA approval?** CMS may require longer demonstration periods before approving ongoing coverage.

### The Medicaid Math

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| RHTP Five-Year Investment | +$1 billion |
| Hospital Tax Revenue Increase | +$1 billion annually |
| Medicaid Expansion Forgone | -$1.9 billion per biennium |
| Federal Work Requirements (2027+) | Unknown coverage impact |
| Projected Medicaid Cuts (Federal) | Varies by formula |

Wisconsin's position is paradoxical. The state invests substantial RHTP resources while simultaneously forgoing larger federal Medicaid investment. The hospital tax increase demonstrates willingness to fund healthcare, yet the same political structure blocks expansion that would reduce state costs.

**RHTP cannot substitute for Medicaid expansion economics.** The $1 billion RHTP investment over five years represents roughly half the biennial savings expansion would generate. Transformation built on constrained coverage cannot achieve the outcomes available to expansion states.

## Conclusion

Wisconsin's $203.7 million FY2026 award validates an application built on genuine infrastructure strengths: 60 Critical Access Hospitals, extensive provider networks, established academic partnerships, and a coverage structure unique among non-expansion states. The **three-initiative architecture** addresses workforce, technology, and care delivery through interconnected investments rather than isolated programs.

The **CHW Medicaid SPA pathway** represents the clearest sustainability mechanism for social care integration in any Series 3 state analysis. If Wisconsin achieves 2028 Medicaid coverage for CHW services, the model demonstrates how federal transformation investment can create permanent coverage categories rather than temporary programs.

The **Rural Health Care Collaborative** addresses technology gaps that prevent coordinated care. Smaller facilities cannot individually afford modern systems, but shared infrastructure creates economies of scale unavailable through facility-by-facility investment.

Yet context constrains optimism. The **2024 HSHS closures** demonstrated that well-intentioned state investment cannot overcome fundamental hospital economics. Facilities serving predominantly Medicare and Medicaid populations cannot survive under current reimbursement structures regardless of technology upgrades or workforce programs.

Wisconsin's political trajectory affects transformation prospects more than RHTP investments themselves. Four consecutive gubernatorial proposals for Medicaid expansion have failed. The state forgoes billions in federal matching while investing hundreds of millions in RHTP. This represents **fiscal choice, not fiscal necessity**, with implications for provider sustainability that transformation investment cannot resolve.

For Wisconsin's 2.14 million rural residents, RHTP represents unprecedented investment in a healthcare infrastructure that recent experience proves fragile. The question is whether workforce, technology, and care coordination investments can strengthen the economic foundation, or whether they build capacity atop financial instability that claims another hospital before 2030.

**Wisconsin has a plan. Whether Wisconsin's political context permits the plan to succeed is another question entirely.**
