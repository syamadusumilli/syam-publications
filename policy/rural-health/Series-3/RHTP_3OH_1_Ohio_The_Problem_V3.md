# RHTP 3.OH.1: Ohio
## The Problem

*Series 3: State Implementation*

## Introduction

On December 29, 2025, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced that Ohio would receive **$202 million** from the Rural Health Transformation Program for fiscal year 2026. Governor Mike DeWine declared the state "grateful to be awarded this funding so that more Ohioans can receive expanded access and enhanced quality to necessary health care."

The gratitude masked a troubling arithmetic. Ohio's award places it **exactly at the national average** of $200 million, neither crisis-level funding like Texas's $281 million nor minimum allocation like smaller states. Average funding for what Ohio's own data describes as a crisis affecting **4.4 million residents** across 73 non-urban counties. The question becomes: Is average sufficient?

The answer requires examining what "average" means in context. Ohio's rural residents experience **higher rates of heart disease, diabetes, COPD, cancer, and suicide** than state averages. Thirteen counties are maternity care deserts. Nearly one in five rural hospitals operates at risk of closure. Primary care availability runs at nearly half urban levels. The workforce pipeline that might address these shortages barely exists. An aging population, with one in three rural Ohioans over age 60, compounds every challenge.

Democratic State Representative Anita Somani offered a blunter assessment: the funding was "equivalent to treating a severed artery with a bandage." Ohio Hospital Association representative Anna Deeter acknowledged that while appreciated, the funding "is still not enough to offset broader federal cuts and therefore will not meaningfully help our rural hospitals."

Part 1 of this analysis establishes the baseline: what crisis Ohio faces, what funding it receives, and what constraints shape implementation. The numbers reveal that average funding applied to a crisis of average severity still leaves fundamental problems unaddressed.

## The Baseline Crisis

### Hospital Infrastructure at the Breaking Point

Ohio's rural hospital landscape tells a story of fragility rather than outright collapse. The state maintains approximately **60 hospitals designated as rural or critical access facilities**, serving communities across 88 counties. These include 33 Critical Access Hospitals operating under cost-based reimbursement and dozens of short-term rural hospitals navigating prospective payment.

The infrastructure exists on paper. The financial reality beneath suggests imminent failure.

In 2024, **88% of Ohio's rural hospitals operated with margins of 2% or less**. Seventy-two percent reported margins at or below zero. These are not sustainable operating conditions. They represent institutions one bad quarter away from service reductions or closure.

The Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform's December 2025 analysis found **7 Ohio hospitals at risk of closing (9%)** with **3 at immediate risk of closure within two to three years (4%)**. A separate June 2025 analysis from the UNC Sheps Center, commissioned by Senate Democrats, identified **11 rural hospitals at risk of closure or service reduction** specifically due to Medicaid cuts in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

Ohio's state RHTP application acknowledged the situation directly: "As of 2023, one in four rural hospitals in Ohio operated at a financial loss, and 18% were considered vulnerable for closure." Since 2010, **three rural hospitals have closed** and ten more remained at risk when the application was submitted.

The at-risk hospitals are not abstractions. **Wayne HealthCare** serves Darke County's 51,000 residents as the only hospital in western Ohio's agricultural heartland. **Adena Health System** and **Southern Ohio Medical Center** anchor healthcare delivery across Appalachian counties where alternatives require hour-long drives. **Memorial Health System** and **Genesis Health System** serve communities where hospital closure would eliminate not just healthcare but major employment.

### Appalachian Concentration of Crisis

Ohio's 32 Appalachian counties form the epicenter of rural health failure. The region stretches from the northeastern corner of the state to the southernmost border, encompassing some of the most economically distressed communities in America.

The Health Policy Institute of Ohio's 2024 data snapshot documented the disparity starkly:

**Mortality outcomes** in rural Appalachian Ohio exceed state averages across every major category. Drug overdose and suicide mortality, heart disease mortality, and preventable death rates all concentrate in the southeastern quadrant of the state. Fourteen of fifteen counties with Ohio's highest suicide rates fall in rural or Appalachian regions.

**Provider shortages** compound mortality disparities. In urban areas, one primary care provider serves approximately every 1,500 residents. In rural Ohio, the ratio drops to one provider per 3,000 residents. In Appalachian Ohio counties, one primary care provider serves approximately every **3,500 residents**. The ten counties with the lowest provider rates per capita are all rural or partially rural.

**Life expectancy** in Ohio's Appalachian counties runs **10 years shorter** than across the rest of the state. The gap reflects accumulated disadvantage: higher poverty, lower educational attainment, fewer healthcare providers, limited transportation, and cultural factors that delay care-seeking until conditions become critical.

**Behavioral health** deficits prove especially severe. Rural Appalachian Ohioans face mental health provider deserts spanning multiple counties. The 2024-2026 Ohio Suicide Prevention Plan identified the region as requiring targeted intervention, but intervention requires providers who do not exist in sufficient numbers to deliver it.

### Workforce Shortages as Root Cause

Every access barrier traces back to workforce. Ohio cannot staff expanded services without providers. It cannot operate innovation hubs without care coordinators. It cannot deliver telehealth without clinicians on the other end of connections.

Ohio's application to CMS acknowledged the scope: "Provider shortages are widespread: primary care availability is nearly half that of urban regions, and behavioral and oral health gaps persist."

The state produces physicians through three medical schools: **The Ohio State University**, **Northeast Ohio Medical University**, and **Ohio University Heritage College of Osteopathic Medicine**. The American Journal of Managed Care estimates **more than 90% of rural counties nationally face primary care physician shortages**. Ohio's rural counties conform to that pattern.

The pipeline problem extends beyond immediate shortages. Ohio trains physicians who leave. Medical school graduates depart for higher-paying positions in other states, urban opportunities in Cleveland or Columbus, or simply places where they won't be the only specialist within 50 miles. The physicians who remain in rural Ohio are aging. Retirement looms. Recruitment fails.

**Maternity care deserts** illustrate workforce consequences. Ohio's application identified **13 counties lacking any obstetric services**. Women in these counties drive hours for prenatal care and delivery, with documented consequences for maternal and infant mortality. The providers to staff birthing services cannot be recruited because the economic model cannot support them.

**Behavioral health** shortages may be most acute. Rural Ohio lacks psychiatrists, psychologists, licensed clinical social workers, and addiction specialists in any concentration approaching need. The opioid crisis that devastated Appalachian communities found healthcare systems without capacity to respond.

### Geographic Scale and Variation

Ohio's 88 counties span from the industrial urban cores of Cleveland, Columbus, and Cincinnati to agricultural flatlands in the northwest, Appalachian hollows in the southeast, and everything between. The variation defies single-strategy responses.

**Appalachian Ohio** experiences poverty, geographic isolation, and health outcome disparities rooted in economic decline from coal and manufacturing. Communities in Meigs, Gallia, and Athens counties face hour-long drives to hospitals capable of handling complex cases.

**Northwestern agricultural counties** present different challenges: healthy working-age populations supporting aging farm communities, with healthcare needs concentrated among the elderly and injury-prone agricultural workers.

**Exurban growth counties** around Columbus experience population expansion straining healthcare infrastructure designed for smaller populations. Different problems than declining rural areas but problems nonetheless.

A single statewide RHTP strategy must accommodate this variation. The $202 million, already modest per capita, must deploy across contexts so different they require fundamentally different approaches.

## The Funding Reality

### Award Amount and National Context

**Ohio RHTP Award Summary**

| Metric | Value | National Rank |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| FY2026 Award | $202,030,262 | Near median |
| Five-Year Projected Total | ~$1.01 billion | Near median |
| Rural Population Served | 4.4 million | Top 10 |
| Per Rural Resident (annual) | ~$46 | Below average |
| Per Rural Resident (five-year) | ~$230 | Below average |

The numbers invert expectations. Ohio ranks near the median in absolute funding but below average in per-capita allocation. With 4.4 million rural residents, Ohio's large rural population becomes a **structural disadvantage** under the RHTP formula that distributes half of funding equally across all states regardless of rural population size.

### Per-Capita Mathematics

**$202 million divided by 4.4 million rural residents equals approximately $46 per person per year.**

For context, consider what $46 per person must accomplish:

- **Hospital stabilization** for facilities where 72% operate with zero or negative margins
- **Workforce recruitment** to address primary care availability at half urban rates
- **Maternity care restoration** in 13 counties without obstetric services
- **Behavioral health expansion** in a region devastated by opioid crisis
- **Technology deployment** including telehealth, remote monitoring, and EHR interoperability
- **School-based health center creation** across K-12 and college campuses
- **EMS transformation** to enable treat-in-place protocols

Per capita healthcare spending in the United States averages over $12,000 annually. RHTP funding represents less than **0.5% of annual healthcare spending** for rural Ohioans, spread across five years.

### Comparison to Crisis States

Ohio's award falls between the extremes. Texas received $281 million but serves 4.7 million rural residents at approximately $60 per capita. Mississippi received $206 million for 1.5 million rural residents at roughly $137 per capita. Alaska received $281 million for approximately 250,000 rural residents at over $1,100 per capita.

The formula rewards geographic sparsity and small populations over absolute need. Ohio, with a large rural population concentrated in a relatively dense geographic area by rural standards, receives proportionally less per person than states with fewer rural residents spread across vast territories.

## The Fiscal Context

### Medicaid Expansion: Ohio's Distinguishing Choice

Ohio expanded Medicaid in 2014 under the Affordable Care Act, extending coverage to approximately **700,000 Ohioans**. The decision, made by Republican Governor John Kasich over legislative opposition, improved rural hospital finances and reduced uncompensated care burdens.

Governor DeWine has maintained expansion despite ongoing political pressure to reverse it. This policy continuity distinguishes Ohio from non-expansion neighbors like Tennessee and provides a coverage foundation that non-expansion states lack.

But expansion occurred in 2014. RHTP arrives in 2026. Between those dates: the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that authorized RHTP funding while simultaneously cutting the Medicaid that sustains Ohio's rural hospitals.

### The Medicaid Mathematics

The same legislation that created the $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program includes **Medicaid cuts projected to reduce federal funding to Ohio by $33 billion over 10 years**, according to Kaiser Family Foundation analysis.

More specifically:

- **$5.6 billion** in Medicaid funding cuts to Ohio's rural areas over 10 years
- **270,000 Ohioans** projected to lose Medicaid coverage by 2034
- **$6.45 billion** in losses to Ohio's rural hospitals specifically over 10 years
- **11 rural hospitals** identified as at-risk due to the cuts

Ohio's five-year RHTP allocation of approximately $1.01 billion must be weighed against these losses. RHTP provides roughly **$200 million annually from 2026-2030**. Medicaid cuts begin in 2027 and accelerate through 2034. The net effect: temporary transformation funding followed by permanent revenue reduction.

### Work Requirements and Coverage Loss

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act imposes work requirements for Medicaid expansion enrollees beginning in 2027. Enrollees aged 19 to 64 must work or study 80 hours monthly and document compliance every six months.

The Congressional Budget Office estimates **10.3 million people nationally** will lose coverage by 2034, including Ohio's 270,000. Many will lose coverage not because they fail to work but because they fail to navigate documentation requirements. Arkansas's earlier work requirement experiment demonstrated that administrative complexity causes eligible individuals to lose coverage regardless of actual work status.

For rural hospitals operating on zero or negative margins, fewer insured patients means increased uncompensated care. The Commonwealth Fund estimated Ohio's rural hospitals will see **uncompensated care costs increase 19.2% to 21.7%** under the new requirements.

### Provider Tax Limitations

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act caps and gradually reduces provider taxes, the mechanism states use to draw federal Medicaid matching funds. Ohio's provider tax rate will decline from current levels to 3.5% by 2031.

The Ohio Hospital Association noted that while Ohio temporarily increased provider taxes before the law took effect (allowing brief improvement), "starting in 2028 that match is going to start coming down a half a percent per year." Long-term, hospitals see less Medicaid revenue even if they maintain patient volume.

## The External View

### What Outsiders See

National narratives about Ohio oscillate between nostalgia and dismissal. **Nostalgic**: the heartland, industrial heritage, swing state importance. **Dismissive**: Rust Belt decline, Trump country, opioid epidemic ground zero.

Neither perspective captures rural Ohioans as they are: people navigating the gap between the economy that was and the economy that is, trying to access healthcare in systems designed for densities they lack.

### What Outsiders Miss

The **Appalachian cultural context** shapes healthcare utilization in ways external observers rarely understand. Distrust of outsiders until relationships are established. Reluctance to seek care until conditions become severe. Family networks that substitute for formal support systems. These patterns require healthcare delivery models that build trust over time, not one-time interventions.

The **variation within rural Ohio** disappears in aggregate statistics. Appalachian poverty differs from northwestern agricultural community dynamics differs from exurban growth pressures. State-level analysis obscures county-level reality.

The **workforce exodus** that drains rural Ohio of its most educated young people extends beyond healthcare. Rural communities lose their potential doctors, nurses, and administrators to the same forces that take their potential teachers, engineers, and entrepreneurs. Healthcare workforce shortage is symptom of broader demographic challenge.

## Politics and Policy

### Medicaid Expansion as Exhausted Political Capital

Defending Medicaid expansion against state legislative efforts to reverse it consumed political capital over the past decade. Governor Kasich spent his governorship protecting the decision. Governor DeWine continues protection despite his party's opposition.

The political coalition that defended expansion is exhausted. Asking that coalition to support additional rural health investments requires demonstrating RHTP produces visible results. Governor DeWine needs wins that justify the political cost of maintaining expansion, not experiments that might fail.

### Federal Scoring Constraints

CMS evaluated RHTP applications based on rural population, health outcomes, facility status, and proposed initiatives. Ohio's application scored adequately across factors without excelling dramatically on any.

**Moderate rural population** (4.4 million, large but not Texas-scale). **Moderate health outcomes** (worse than urban but not Mississippi-level). **Moderate facility status** (at-risk hospitals but not Texas closure rates). **Conventional proposed initiatives** (workforce pipelines, school-based centers, innovation hubs).

Average score produced average funding. Whether this represents strategic calculation or missed opportunity depends on what Ohio actually accomplishes with the resources awarded.

### State Political Reality

Ohio's political environment constrains what RHTP can accomplish:

**Medicaid expansion will be defended, not expanded.** No political appetite exists for additional coverage programs or enhanced benefits.

**Scope of practice expansions face opposition.** Physician groups resist independent practice for nurse practitioners and physician assistants. Ohio won't use RHTP to fight that battle.

**School-based health centers enjoy bipartisan support.** Children generate sympathy. Visible infrastructure in rural districts translates to political advantage.

**Workforce investments align with business community interests.** Employers want workers. Loan repayment programs produce healthcare workers who become employees.

These constraints don't represent failure of imagination. They represent political realities that Ohio health officials navigate because failing to do so means accomplishing nothing.

## What the State Must Do

### Non-Negotiable Requirements

Ohio's RHTP application commits to specific deliverables:

- **Rural Health Innovation Hubs** establishing clinically integrated networks across rural counties
- **Emergency Care Transformation** scaling treat-in-place protocols statewide
- **School-Based Health Centers** on K-12 and college campuses
- **OH SEE Program** expanding mobile vision, hearing, and dental care
- **Rural Workforce Pipeline** from high school through professional employment

The two-year spending requirement demands FY2026 funds be obligated by September 30, 2027. Twenty-one months to structure subawards, select partners, launch initiatives, and demonstrate progress. The requirement forces action but risks hasty decisions.

### Strategic Choices Available

Within requirements, Ohio retains discretion:

**Geographic focus** versus statewide distribution. Concentrating resources in highest-need Appalachian counties produces concentrated impact. Distributing across all 73 non-urban counties produces diluted but politically defensible allocation.

**Initiative prioritization** when resources fall short. School-based health centers offer visible wins. Workforce pipelines produce long-term capacity. Innovation hubs require complex coordination. Choices reveal actual priorities.

**Partner selection** shapes implementation. Academic medical centers bring expertise and research capacity. Community organizations bring local relationships and cultural competence. Hospitals bring infrastructure and clinical capacity. The mix determines what gets built.

### The 2030 Cliff

RHTP funding expires after fiscal year 2030. Whatever Ohio builds must either achieve self-sustainability or disappear when federal support ends.

**School-based health centers** need sustainable Medicaid reimbursement or school district funding to continue. **Workforce loan repayment** requires state appropriations post-federal funding. **Innovation hubs** need revenue models supporting coordination activities that don't generate direct billing.

The challenge: building infrastructure that survives requires starting sustainability planning now, not in 2029 when funding is about to end.

## Conclusion

Ohio receives average RHTP funding to address what its own data acknowledges as a serious but not catastrophic rural health crisis. The **$202 million for fiscal year 2026** must serve **4.4 million rural residents** across 73 non-urban counties, with particular concentration in 32 Appalachian counties experiencing the state's worst health outcomes.

The arithmetic produces approximately **$46 per rural resident annually**. This is not transformation money. It is supplemental funding that might produce visible improvements without addressing structural problems that created rural healthcare crisis over decades.

The **Medicaid context** complicates everything. RHTP provides roughly $1 billion over five years. Medicaid cuts reduce Ohio rural healthcare funding by **$5.6 billion** over ten years. The program theoretically created to offset Medicaid cuts provides less than 20% of what those cuts will extract from rural Ohio.

Ohio's political environment shapes what RHTP can accomplish. Medicaid expansion survives but won't expand. Scope of practice battles won't be fought. School-based health centers and workforce pipelines enjoy bipartisan support. The constraints are real and implementation must work within them.

Part 2 of this analysis examines what Ohio proposes: Rural Health Innovation Hubs, Emergency Care Transformation, School-Based Health Centers, the OH SEE Program, and the Rural Workforce Pipeline. Whether plans match funding, and whether funding matches need, determines whether rural Ohioans experience transformation or incrementalism dressed in transformation rhetoric.

Part 3 will assess whether the plan can work, what survives when constraints bite, and what Ohio's choices reveal about stated versus actual priorities.

For 4.4 million rural Ohioans, the stakes are immediate. Hospital financial viability. Provider availability. Maternal care access. Behavioral health capacity. Emergency response capability. The question is not whether $202 million is better than nothing. Obviously it is. The question is whether it is enough to matter.
