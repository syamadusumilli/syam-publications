# RHTP 3.ID: Idaho

*Telehealth transformation meets political volatility in the nation's fastest-growing rural state.*

## Introduction

Idaho received **$185,974,368** in RHTP funding for FY2026, the first installment of approximately **$930 million** over five years. For a state that has seen its population surge past two million while remaining fundamentally rural, this represents a significant investment in healthcare infrastructure that has struggled to keep pace with growth.

Yet Idaho's RHTP story unfolds against **profound Medicaid instability**. The same legislative session that prepared to receive nearly a billion dollars in federal rural health funding also advanced legislation threatening to cap Medicaid expansion enrollment at 50,000 people, below half its current level, and impose work requirements that could disenroll tens of thousands more. The state already implemented a **4% across-the-board Medicaid reimbursement cut** in September 2025, citing budget pressures.

The **central tension** shaping Idaho's transformation: Can technology investments and workforce expansion deliver improved rural health outcomes when the state's dominant coverage program for rural residents faces simultaneous political and fiscal assault? Idaho proposes to modernize rural healthcare delivery while the foundation of that delivery, Medicaid coverage for low-income rural residents, remains contested territory.

## Rural Health Landscape

### Infrastructure Baseline

Idaho's healthcare infrastructure reflects the challenge of covering **83,574 square miles** with facilities concentrated in urban corridors while vast rural expanses remain underserved.

**Critical Access Hospitals:** 26 facilities certified as CAHs serve rural communities, with 100% participating in the Medicare Beneficiary Quality Improvement Project. Idaho ranked **fourth nationally** for CAH data reporting and quality improvement in 2024. These facilities maintain 25 beds or fewer and provide 24/7 emergency services, typically located more than 35 miles from other hospitals.

**Rural Health Clinics:** 57 certified RHCs operate across the state, providing primary care in areas designated as shortage regions.

**Federally Qualified Health Centers:** 16 community health centers operate 72 clinic sites serving 53 rural communities. These FQHCs often serve as the **only source of primary and preventive care** in rural Idaho, with patient populations heavily concentrated in Medicaid and Medicare beneficiaries alongside significant uninsured populations.

**Major Health Systems:** St. Luke's Health System operates as the largest provider with **200 clinics, 1,000 beds, and 30 medical centers**, including the state's only Children's Hospital. St. Luke's pioneered telehealth in Idaho, opening a 35,000 square foot virtual hospital in 2018 specifically targeting patients in remote rural areas.

### Geographic Reality

Idaho's geography creates healthcare access challenges that technology alone cannot fully address. The state ranks **44th in population density** at approximately 19 people per square mile. More precisely:

**County Classification:**
- 44 total counties
- 35 counties classified as rural (no population center exceeding 20,000)
- 18 counties classified as **frontier** (fewer than 6 people per square mile)
- 66% of population concentrated in just 7 urban areas

The density contrast is stark: Ada County (Boise metropolitan area) has **510 people per square mile** while Custer County has **2 people per square mile**. This 255-fold difference within a single state defines the transportation and access barriers rural Idahoans face.

**Rural Population:** Approximately **500,418 people** (26.4% of total population) live in nonmetropolitan areas. Unlike most states where rural populations decline, Idaho's rural counties have grown faster than urban areas since 2020, reversing a decade-long trend.

### Workforce Crisis

Idaho faces acute provider shortages across nearly every healthcare discipline, with **all 44 counties** designated as Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas.

**Primary Care:** Significant shortages exist throughout rural regions, with FQHCs struggling to recruit and retain physicians despite loan repayment programs administered through the Bureau of Rural Health and Primary Care.

**Maternal Health:** Idaho ranks **27th nationally** for active obstetricians, gynecologists, and midwives per 100,000 females. More concerning, women in frontier and rural areas access first-trimester prenatal care at **lower rates** than urban counterparts and experience higher rates of unintended pregnancy, teen births, and adverse birth outcomes.

**Emergency Medical Services:** Perhaps the most critical shortage exists in emergency response. Only **28% of Idaho's rural counties** have at least one county-level full-time equivalent paid EMS position. The remaining 72% rely entirely on volunteers, creating response time variability and coverage gaps that can prove fatal in medical emergencies.

**Medical Education Pipeline:** Idaho partners with the University of Washington through the WWAMI program, reserving **40 seats** in UW's medical school for Idaho students who train in-state for four years, building familiarity with rural health needs. This pipeline helps but cannot meet overall demand.

### Tribal Health Infrastructure

Idaho is home to **five federally recognized tribes** with distinct healthcare needs and delivery systems:

- **Coeur d'Alene Tribe** (Northern Idaho, 2,190+ members, 345,000 acre reservation)
- **Kootenai Tribe of Idaho** (Northern Idaho)
- **Nez Perce Tribe** (North-central Idaho)
- **Shoshone-Bannock Tribes** (Fort Hall Reservation, southeastern Idaho)
- **Shoshone-Paiute Tribes** (Duck Valley Reservation, Idaho-Nevada border)

Additionally, the **Northwestern Band of the Shoshone Nation** has members in the Pocatello area who receive services at the Fort Hall facility.

Each tribe operates health centers on tribal lands in addition to accessing Indian Health Service facilities. The **Not-Tsoo Gah-Nee Health Clinic** on the Fort Hall Reservation serves over 20,000 registered American Indian and Alaska Native patients with approximately 50,000 ambulatory visits annually. The Fort Hall Service Unit achieved joint accreditation with the Shoshone-Bannock Tribal Health and Human Services, becoming the first and only federal service unit to attain this recognition.

Tribal health programs provide comprehensive services including medical, nursing, pharmacy, dental, optometry, radiology, and behavioral health through programs like the **Four Directions Treatment Center** for substance use disorders.

### Health Outcomes

Rural Idahoans experience measurably worse health outcomes than their urban counterparts:

**Maternal and Child Health:** Rural women have higher rates of smoking during pregnancy, lower breastfeeding rates, higher prevalence of overweight and obesity, and higher rates of low birth weight and preterm births. American Indian and Alaska Native women experience the **highest rates of smoking during pregnancy** and the **lowest prevalence of prenatal care** statewide.

**Chronic Disease:** Provider shortages and access barriers contribute to delayed diagnosis and management of chronic conditions. Idaho's community health needs assessments consistently identify diabetes, hypertension, and obesity as priority concerns, with rural populations experiencing higher prevalence.

**Behavioral Health:** With every county designated as a mental health professional shortage area, rural Idahoans face significant barriers to behavioral health services. Local culture compounds the challenge, as one community assessment noted: the closeness of small communities affects anonymity, making residents reluctant to seek mental health care.

## RHTP Award and Context

### Funding Analysis

**FY2026 Award:** $185,974,368

**Five-Year Projection:** Approximately $930 million (assuming consistent annual allocations)

**Per Rural Resident:** $372 per nonmetropolitan resident annually, placing Idaho in the **upper tier** of per-capita RHTP funding nationally. This favorable position reflects Idaho's combination of substantial rural population and high frontier county proportion, which receives formula weight in CMS calculations.

**Award Percentage:** Idaho requested $193.3 million and received $186 million, approximately **96% of request**. This high approval rate suggests CMS found Idaho's application well-aligned with statutory priorities.

### Medicaid Context

Idaho's Medicaid situation creates the most significant uncertainty surrounding RHTP implementation.

**Expansion Status:** Idaho expanded Medicaid via **ballot measure in November 2018** with 61% voter approval. Implementation began in 2020. Enrollment peaked at approximately **145,000 people** in early 2023 before pandemic-era continuous coverage rules ended.

**Current Enrollment:** Approximately **90,000 people** remain enrolled under Medicaid expansion as of late 2024, following significant disenrollment during the unwinding process (189,000+ people disenrolled from all Idaho Medicaid programs by February 2024).

**Legislative Threats:** The 2025 legislative session produced **HB138**, which passed the House in February 2025 and would:
- Cap Medicaid expansion enrollment at **50,000 people** (below half current enrollment)
- Impose **work requirements** of 80 hours monthly
- Allow people with income between 100-138% of poverty to choose Marketplace coverage instead of Medicaid
- Include a trigger law **ending expansion** if federal funding drops below 90%

A separate bill introduced in January 2025 sought outright repeal of Medicaid expansion.

**Reimbursement Cuts:** In August 2025, the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare announced **4% across-the-board Medicaid reimbursement cuts** effective September 1, 2025, citing budget growth 19% above projections. The state estimated savings of $36.8 million in FY2026. Only tribal providers, FQHCs, and rural health clinics received exemption from the cuts.

**Federal Medicaid Impact:** The One Big Beautiful Bill Act is projected to reduce federal Medicaid funding to Idaho by **$4.3 billion over ten years** and potentially reduce enrollment by 40,000 people. An additional 58,000 Idahoans face coverage loss risk from federal work requirements taking effect in 2027.

**Net Position:** Idaho receives approximately $930 million in RHTP funding over five years while potentially losing $4.3 billion in Medicaid funding over ten years. The RHTP investment represents roughly **22% of projected Medicaid losses**, and RHTP restrictions prohibit using funds to backfill lost Medicaid revenue.

## State Approach

### Governance Structure

**Lead Agency:** Idaho Department of Health and Welfare serves as the designated RHTP recipient, with the Bureau of Rural Health and Primary Care in the Division of Public Health leading implementation.

**Executive Engagement:** Governor Brad Little created the **Idaho Rural Health Taskforce** in October 2025 to guide application development. The Taskforce included legislative leaders, tribal representation, and executive branch officials from across state government.

**Stakeholder Input:** The state conducted a public and stakeholder input survey from September 5-30, 2025. Over **500 respondents** from every county submitted responses about how to prioritize funds. Approximately 200 respondents submitted specific concepts or ideas. Of total respondents, 216 identified as public members and 287 as rural health stakeholders.

### Survey Priorities

Respondent priorities shaped the application framework:

1. **Recruiting and retaining clinical workforce talent** to rural areas, with commitments to serve rural communities for a minimum of 5 years
2. **Assisting rural communities** to identify their healthcare delivery needs across emergency, pre-hospital, and outpatient care
3. **Improving prevention and chronic disease management**

### Strategic Framework

Idaho's application organizes funding around **five initiatives**:

**Initiative 1: Improving Rural Access to Care Through Technology**
- Deploy telehealth **kiosks and pods** in community settings: libraries, grocery stores, pharmacies
- Enable telehealth appointments and mail-order prescription pickup at these locations
- Procure mobile apps and online portals for self-monitoring, appointment scheduling, medication adherence, and coaching
- Invest in cybersecurity improvements and AI clinical tools
- Upgrade emergency communication systems and health analytics platforms

**Initiative 2: Ensuring Accessible, Quality Care Through Innovative Models**
- Expand EMS professional scope of practice
- Develop **Community Health Emergency Medical Services** plan
- Allow trained EMS professionals to perform check-ups and wellness assessments in homes
- Create designated locations for in-person contact hours
- Establish EMS apprenticeship programs

**Initiative 3: Sustaining Rural Workforce Through Training, Recruitment, and Retention**
- Target EMS professional recruitment and retention
- Increase percentage of rural counties with full-time paid EMS from **28% to higher targets**
- Support clinical workforce across disciplines
- Enforce five-year rural service commitments for recipients of recruitment support

**Initiative 4: Implementing Population-Specific, Evidence-Based Projects**
- Promote preventive health interventions
- Address root causes of diseases in rural communities
- Conduct rural health facility assessments to identify service gaps
- Develop shared infrastructure among providers

**Initiative 5: Investing in Rural Health Infrastructure and Partnerships**
- Equipment, software, and training to expand telehealth options
- Support regional coordination among rural providers
- Strengthen connections between facilities and communities

### Tribal Engagement

Idaho committed to setting aside **3.5% of its RHTP award** to support tribal healthcare programs. With a $186 million annual award, this represents approximately **$6.5 million annually** or $32.5 million over five years dedicated to tribal health initiatives.

The five federally recognized tribes participated in application development through the Rural Health Taskforce. Tribal leaders met with HHS Secretary Kennedy in July 2025 to discuss IHS staffing crises, behavioral health programs, and protection of traditional food sources including salmon.

## Program and Funding Distribution

| Initiative | Focus Area | Key Activities | Target Population |
|------------|------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Technology Access | Telehealth infrastructure | Kiosks, pods, mobile apps, AI tools | All rural residents |
| Innovative Care Models | EMS expansion | Community paramedicine, home wellness checks | Remote communities |
| Workforce | Recruitment/retention | EMS professionals, clinical staff | Healthcare workforce |
| Population Health | Prevention | Chronic disease, evidence-based interventions | High-risk populations |
| Infrastructure | Partnerships | Equipment, shared services, coordination | Provider organizations |
| Tribal Health | Set-aside (3.5%) | Tribal-determined priorities | Tribal communities |

**Note:** Idaho's application organized funding by initiative rather than providing discrete dollar allocations per program. Subawards will be distributed in accordance with Idaho procurement law, with specific allocations emerging during implementation.

## Social Care Integration

| Component | Included in Plan | Funding Level | Implementation Approach | Likely Funded? |
|-----------|------------------|---------------|------------------------|----------------|
| SDOH/HRSN | Implicit | Not discrete | Through population health and prevention initiatives | At Risk |
| CHW Programs | Limited | Not specified | Not emphasized in application; existing FQHC CHWs continue | At Risk |
| CIE Platform | No | Not proposed | No Community Information Exchange deployment mentioned | No |

**Assessment:** Idaho's application **prioritizes technology and workforce** over explicit social care integration. SDOH screening and referral may occur within expanded primary care and telehealth, but no systematic social needs intervention infrastructure appears in the plan. The state's established Community Health Worker presence through FQHCs and tribal programs continues without significant RHTP investment.

## Assessment

### Strengths

**Technology Innovation:** Idaho's emphasis on telehealth kiosks in non-traditional settings (libraries, grocery stores, pharmacies) could significantly expand access points for rural residents who cannot travel to healthcare facilities. The approach recognizes that distance is the fundamental barrier and brings services to where people already go.

**EMS Transformation:** The Community Health EMS concept addresses Idaho's critical workforce gap creatively. Enabling EMS professionals to provide wellness checks and chronic disease monitoring in homes leverages existing (if limited) personnel infrastructure for expanded functions, potentially improving prevention while generating sustainable revenue for EMS organizations.

**Formula Advantage:** At $372 per rural resident, Idaho receives favorable per-capita funding that provides meaningful resources for transformation. The 96% award approval rate suggests federal confidence in the state's approach.

**Tribal Set-Aside:** The explicit 3.5% tribal health commitment ensures tribal communities receive dedicated resources rather than competing for general program funds. This structured approach supports tribal self-determination in healthcare priorities.

**CAH Quality Foundation:** Idaho's critical access hospitals demonstrate strong quality improvement engagement, ranking fourth nationally. This existing performance culture provides a foundation for transformation initiatives.

### Vulnerabilities

**Medicaid Instability:** The most significant risk to Idaho's rural health transformation lies not in RHTP implementation but in Medicaid coverage erosion. If HB138 or similar legislation takes effect, capping expansion enrollment at 50,000 people would remove coverage from approximately **40,000 current enrollees**, overwhelming any RHTP investment benefits. Work requirements would further reduce coverage.

**Reimbursement Cuts:** The 4% Medicaid reimbursement reduction directly undermines provider financial stability that RHTP aims to support. Rural hospitals operating on 1% or negative margins face compounded pressure from reduced payments, potentially forcing service reductions or closures even as RHTP invests in transformation.

**Social Care Gap:** The absence of explicit SDOH/HRSN screening infrastructure, CHW investment, or CIE platform development means Idaho's transformation focuses on clinical care access without systematically addressing the social determinants that drive health outcomes. Technology enables telehealth appointments; it does not address food insecurity, housing instability, or transportation barriers.

**EMS Baseline:** Starting from only 28% of rural counties having full-time paid EMS positions means the Community Health EMS vision requires building workforce nearly from scratch. Volunteer EMS systems may struggle to transition to expanded professional roles without sustained funding.

**Political Context:** Idaho's conservative legislature has repeatedly attempted to repeal voter-approved Medicaid expansion. This political environment creates uncertainty about state commitment to healthcare coverage expansion even as federal dollars flow for transformation.

### Sustainability Considerations

**Post-2030 Viability:** Idaho's technology investments (telehealth platforms, kiosks, AI tools) require ongoing operational funding after RHTP ends. Without Medicaid or commercial payer commitments to reimburse telehealth at sustainable rates, infrastructure could become stranded.

**EMS Sustainability:** Expanded EMS roles depend on reimbursement pathways. Community paramedicine and mobile integrated healthcare receive inconsistent payment from payers. Idaho would need to establish Medicaid reimbursement for these services to sustain them post-RHTP.

**Tribal Program Continuity:** The 3.5% set-aside ends with RHTP in 2030. Tribal health programs would need alternative federal funding sources (IHS allocations, 638 contracts) or state commitment to maintain enhanced services.

### Critical Success Factors

1. **Medicaid Coverage Stability:** If expansion enrollment remains above 80,000 and work requirements either do not take effect or include robust exemptions, RHTP investments can build on a coverage foundation. If coverage erodes significantly, transformation loses its patient population.

2. **EMS Workforce Achievement:** Success depends on increasing rural counties with paid EMS positions from 28% toward majority coverage. This requires competitive compensation, career pathways, and sustainable organizational models.

3. **Telehealth Utilization:** Deploying kiosks matters only if patients use them. Success requires community awareness, digital literacy support, and clinical workflows that integrate remote visits with primary care.

4. **Reimbursement Reversal:** If Idaho can reverse Medicaid rate cuts, either through improved budget projections or policy choice, provider financial stability improves. Continued cuts accelerate workforce departure.

5. **Political Resolution:** Legislative commitment to maintain Medicaid expansion, or at minimum avoid further restrictions, determines whether RHTP investments address a stable population or a shrinking one.

## Conclusion

Idaho's RHTP approach reflects **genuine innovation** in rural healthcare delivery: telehealth kiosks in grocery stores, EMS professionals conducting home wellness visits, and explicit tribal health set-asides. These strategies recognize Idaho's geography and workforce constraints while proposing creative solutions.

Yet the state simultaneously pursues policies that could **undermine its own transformation**. A legislature threatening to cap Medicaid expansion enrollment at half its current level while receiving federal rural health funds creates fundamental incoherence. The 4% Medicaid reimbursement cut, implemented as RHTP awards were announced, directly contradicts the program's sustainability goals.

**What to Watch:**
- HB138 status and any Medicaid enrollment changes
- EMS workforce metrics (county coverage percentage)
- Telehealth kiosk deployment locations and utilization data
- Tribal set-aside implementation and tribal-determined priorities
- Provider financial stability following reimbursement cuts
- Federal work requirement implementation beginning 2027

Idaho demonstrates that RHTP funding cannot transform rural health in isolation. Technology and workforce investments require a **coverage foundation**. If that foundation crumbles through state or federal policy choices, even substantial RHTP investment becomes investment in infrastructure serving a diminishing patient population.

The state that grew faster than almost any other now faces a choice: honor the voter mandate for Medicaid expansion while leveraging federal transformation dollars, or continue political warfare against coverage expansion while accepting federal funds ostensibly aimed at improving rural health. The outcomes for Idaho's 500,000 rural residents depend heavily on which path prevails.
