# RHTP 3.WV.1: West Virginia, The Problem

## The Heart of Appalachia: America's Second Most Rural State Confronts Its Worst Health Outcomes

*Series 3: State Implementation*

On December 29, 2025, Governor Patrick Morrisey announced that West Virginia would receive **$199,476,099 in fiscal year 2026** through the Rural Health Transformation Program. This award, Morrisey emphasized, represents the **highest per capita award of any state that West Virginia touches**, exceeding the amounts flowing to neighboring Virginia ($189.5 million), Maryland ($168 million), and Pennsylvania ($193 million). The claim reflects a state where nearly the entire population lives in conditions defined as rural and where health outcomes consistently rank among the worst in the nation.

West Virginia is not a state that contains rural areas. West Virginia **is** rural. The only state located entirely within Appalachia, West Virginia ranks as the **second most rural state in America** behind only Vermont. Even so, its challenges dwarf those of bucolic New England. West Virginia leads the nation in deaths per capita from cancer, drug overdoses, diabetes, and kidney disease. Life expectancy dropped nearly two years in 2021, the second worst decline nationally. Forty percent of adults are obese. Fifteen percent have diabetes. The workforce participation rate ranks near the bottom nationally, and poor health is the primary reason West Virginians cite for not working.

The RHTP award translates to approximately **$181 per rural resident in FY2026** based on a rural population of approximately 1.1 million (depending on classification methodology). Over five years, West Virginia stands to receive roughly **$1 billion** to transform a health system where **15 rural hospitals (44%) are at risk of closure** and **six hospitals face immediate closure risk within two to three years**. The state expanded Medicaid in 2014, with approximately 522,000 residents currently enrolled, including more than 165,000 in the expansion population. Beginning in fiscal year 2027, Medicaid cuts under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act will extract an estimated **$6.6 billion from West Virginia over ten years**, with annual losses potentially reaching **$900 million** and coverage loss projections between 56,000 and 94,000 residents.

West Virginia applied for RHTP funding not merely to improve health outcomes but to rebuild the economic foundation of the state. Governor Morrisey's **Health to Prosperity** vision frames health improvement as the prerequisite for workforce recovery and economic revival. Whether $199 million annually can accomplish what decades of federal programs could not remains the essential question.

## The Baseline Crisis

West Virginia's health crisis is generational. The state has ranked at or near the bottom of health rankings for decades, and the trajectory worsened even before COVID-19 accelerated deaths and disrupted care. What distinguishes the current moment is not the emergence of new problems but the cumulative weight of old ones compounding under economic pressure, demographic decline, and the continued exodus of young people seeking opportunity elsewhere.

**The Appalachian Reality**

West Virginia is the only state located entirely within Appalachia, and its health challenges reflect the region's defining characteristics: mountainous terrain that isolates communities, coal and extraction economies that have contracted for decades, population decline as young people leave, and persistent poverty concentrated in counties that have never recovered from deindustrialization.

The Appalachian Regional Commission classifies multiple West Virginia counties as **economically distressed**, the commission's lowest designation. These counties cluster in the southern coalfields, where McDowell, Mingo, Logan, and Wyoming counties report poverty rates, unemployment, and health outcomes that rank among the worst in America. McDowell County, once the largest coal-producing county in the state, has lost more than 80% of its peak population. The median household income hovers around $25,000. Life expectancy falls nearly a decade below the national average.

Winding secondary roads connect the majority of the state's population, with little to no public transportation available between many small, isolated towns. This single factor, the absence of transportation infrastructure, shapes every dimension of health access. Patients cannot reach specialists. Providers cannot reach patients. Emergency response times stretch dangerously long on mountain roads that become impassable in winter. The state is traversed by two north-south and one east-west interstate that connect major population centers, but most rural residents live far from these arteries.

**Health Outcomes: The Nation's Worst**

West Virginia does not merely rank poorly on health outcomes. West Virginia leads the nation in mortality from multiple causes.

| Cause of Death | WV Rank (2021) | Deaths per 100,000 |
|----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Cancer | 1st | 184.7 |
| Drug Overdose | 1st | 90.9 |
| Diabetes | 1st | 47.6 |
| Kidney Disease | 1st | 25.8 |
| Accidents | 1st | 134.7 |
| Heart Disease | Top 5 | 223 |
| COPD | Top 5 | Above national average |
| Infant Mortality | Top 10 | Above national average |

The opioid crisis devastated West Virginia more severely than any other state. At its peak, the state recorded overdose death rates nearly three times the national average. Chartis's 2025 Rural Health State of the State report places West Virginia at the **90th percentile nationally for drug overdose deaths** in rural communities, surpassed only by Delaware and a handful of other states. The crisis has evolved from prescription opioids to heroin to fentanyl, but the death toll continues. Substance use disorder remains the single most common barrier to workforce participation that residents cite.

Chronic disease burden reflects decades of poverty, food insecurity, and limited preventive care. The percentage of obese adults reached **40.6% in 2021**, making West Virginia the 49th ranked state for obesity. Physical inactivity affects **30.5% of the population**, ranking West Virginia 45th. Diabetes prevalence increased from 4.7% in 1996 to **15.9% by 2021**, one of the highest rates nationally. Smoking rates remain elevated despite decades of public health campaigns.

According to America's Health Rankings, West Virginia consistently ranks in the **top three nationally for adults self-reporting their general health as either fair or poor**. This self-assessment reflects objective reality. Chronic lower respiratory disease, heart disease, and stroke claim lives at rates far exceeding national averages. The state's predominantly White population (93%) means racial health disparities are less pronounced than in other states, but geographic disparities between urban Charleston and Morgantown versus rural southern and central counties are stark.

**Hospital Vulnerability**

West Virginia has **33 rural hospitals** including 21 Critical Access Hospitals and 11 short-term hospitals outside urban areas. The state's rural hospital infrastructure spans from the Northern Panhandle near Pittsburgh to the southern coalfields along the Kentucky and Virginia borders.

The Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform's December 2025 analysis identified **15 West Virginia rural hospitals (44%) at risk of closure**, meaning their financial reserves can only sustain losses on patient services for six to seven years. More critically, **six hospitals (18%) face immediate closure risk**, meaning they can sustain losses for only two to three more years before exhausting reserves.

| Hospital Risk Category | Count | Percentage |
|----------------------|-------|------------|
| Total Rural Hospitals | 33 | 100% |
| Operating at Loss | 14 | 42% |
| At Risk of Closure | 15 | 44% |
| Immediate Closure Risk | 6 | 18% |

The seven hospitals most frequently cited as at highest risk include:

- **Logan Regional Medical Center** (Logan County)
- **Welch Community Hospital** (McDowell County)
- **Broaddus Hospital Association** (Barbour County, Philippi)
- **Minnie Hamilton Health Care Center** (Calhoun County, Grantsville)
- **Grafton City Hospital** (Taylor County)
- **Jackson General Hospital** (Jackson County)
- **Montgomery General Hospital** (Fayette County)

The University of North Carolina Sheps Center for Health Services Research analysis commissioned by Senate Democrats confirmed these seven facilities face the greatest closure risk due to high Medicaid payer mix combined with consecutive years of negative operating margins. Each serves a community where the nearest alternative hospital may be 45 minutes to an hour away on winding mountain roads.

The West Virginia Hospital Association reports that **approximately 75% of West Virginians receive coverage through governmental programs**, including Medicaid, Medicare, and PEIA (the state employee health plan). All three pay below the cost of care. Hospitals cannot offset government underpayment with private insurance revenue when the privately insured population is so small. The average hospital operates on a **1% operating margin**, and cost increases outpace government payment adjustments.

Jim Kaufman, president and CEO of the West Virginia Hospital Association, warned that hospitals will lose approximately **$1 billion annually** once One Big Beautiful Bill changes to Medicaid supplemental payments are fully implemented. Combined with provider tax limitations that affect the state's ability to draw down federal matching funds, the financial pressure on rural hospitals is approaching a breaking point.

**Historical Context**

West Virginia was not always at the bottom of health rankings. The coal industry that once employed hundreds of thousands provided union health benefits, company hospitals, and economic prosperity that supported functional health systems. The United Mine Workers of America health and retirement funds built hospitals across the coalfields. Company towns provided care as part of the employment bargain.

As coal employment collapsed, beginning in the 1950s and accelerating through each subsequent decade, the infrastructure that depended on industry wages crumbled. Young people left. Tax bases eroded. Hospitals lost volume. The federal government stepped in with Medicare and Medicaid, but reimbursement rates never matched true costs, and the transition from employer-based to government-funded care left rural facilities perpetually undercapitalized.

The opioid crisis added injury to decline. Prescription opioids flooded West Virginia at rates that defied medical justification. In Mingo County, pharmacies dispensed enough pills to supply 200 per person annually. The subsequent wave of addiction, overdose deaths, and social disruption destroyed families, communities, and the remaining fragments of economic stability.

COVID-19 completed the destabilization. Rural hospitals lost volume as patients avoided care, then surged as cases overwhelmed capacity, then lost volume again as deferred care created backlogs. Staff burned out. Nurses left for travel positions paying three times local salaries. Recovery remains incomplete.

**Workforce Crisis**

West Virginia faces **severe Health Professional Shortage Area designations** across most of its rural counties for primary care, mental health, and dental care. The CDC analysis of primary care HPSAs shows the state's southern counties, particularly those in the coalfield region, with the highest shortage scores in the state. Most dark green counties on CDC maps also have the highest rates of chronic disease, creating a feedback loop where provider shortages worsen health outcomes while poor health outcomes accelerate population decline and provider departure.

| Workforce Indicator | WV Status |
|--------------------|-----------|
| Primary Care HPSA Counties | Most rural counties |
| Mental Health HPSA Counties | Statewide shortage |
| Dental Health HPSA Counties | Widespread shortage |
| Physicians per Capita | Near bottom nationally |
| RN Staffing | Below national average |

The state granted nurse practitioners **full practice authority in 2016**, allowing them to diagnose and treat conditions as primary care providers without physician supervision. This policy decision acknowledged reality: there were not enough physicians to supervise anyone, and restricting NP practice would only worsen access problems.

In 2024, the legislature passed **HB 4768** to grant in-state medical school tuition to non-residents who commit to an equal number of years of practice in rural, medically underserved areas. The West Virginia Higher Education Policy Commission offers up to **$40,000 in loan forgiveness** to medical students who agree to practice in state. These programs exist because the state cannot compete on salary, amenities, or career opportunities. Financial incentives are the only lever available.

The workforce crisis extends beyond physicians. Nurses depart for urban facilities or travel positions. Allied health professionals are in short supply. Behavioral health clinicians are nearly nonexistent in rural areas. Substance use disorder treatment requires travel to regional centers hours away. Patients cannot access the care they need because providers do not exist where they live.

**Obstetric and Maternal Care**

West Virginia's maternal health indicators reflect broader patterns of rural health decline. The state reports elevated maternal mortality rates, and access to obstetric care has diminished as rural hospitals stopped offering labor and delivery services.

The reasons are economic. Obstetric units require 24/7 staffing even when delivery volume is low. Malpractice insurance costs are substantial. Recruiting obstetricians to rural areas is nearly impossible when urban practices offer higher salaries, better call schedules, and more advanced facilities. Rural hospitals that once delivered babies now refer pregnant women to regional centers, extending travel distances and creating access barriers.

The postpartum Medicaid extension to one year, implemented nationally and in West Virginia, provides coverage but does not restore delivery services that no longer exist. Women in southern West Virginia may travel over an hour for prenatal appointments and delivery, assuming they have transportation and can take time from work for the journey.

## The Funding Reality

West Virginia's RHTP award of **$199,476,099 for fiscal year 2026** places it in the upper half of state awards nationally and well above the baseline $100 million floor that all states receive regardless of need.

**Award Breakdown**

| Component | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| Baseline Allocation | $100,000,000 |
| Workload Funding | $99,476,099 |
| Total FY2026 Award | $199,476,099 |
| Five-Year Projection | ~$1 billion |
| Amount Requested | ~$1 billion |
| Award vs. Request | ~100% (first year) |

**Per Capita Analysis**

West Virginia's per capita funding varies based on rural population definition. Using a rural population of approximately 1.1 million (the state's total population is 1.77 million, and even urban areas in West Virginia are small by national standards):

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| FY2026 Per Rural Resident | ~$181 |
| Five-Year Per Rural Resident | ~$909 |

This per capita funding exceeds neighboring states:

| State | FY2026 Award | Rural Population | Per Capita |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|------------|
| West Virginia | $199M | ~1.1M | ~$181 |
| Virginia | $189.5M | ~1.07M | ~$177 |
| Pennsylvania | $193M | ~3.37M | ~$57 |
| Ohio | $202M | ~2.1M | ~$96 |
| Kentucky | $213M | ~1.8M | ~$118 |
| Maryland | $168M | ~416K | ~$404 |

Governor Morrisey's claim about per capita leadership among neighboring states holds when Maryland is excluded (Maryland's small rural population produces high per capita figures from modest absolute funding). Among Appalachian neighbor states with substantial rural populations, West Virginia does receive more per rural resident.

**The Medicaid Offset Problem**

The central tension in West Virginia's RHTP calculus is Medicaid. The state expanded Medicaid in 2014, with current enrollment of approximately **522,000 people**, including more than **165,000 in the expansion population** (adults ages 19 to 64 earning up to 138% of the federal poverty level). Medicaid enrollment represents **34.6% of West Virginia's population**, the seventh highest rate nationally.

Expansion brought substantial benefits:

- Uncompensated care costs at hospitals declined 40% between 2013 and 2014
- Coverage enabled treatment for chronic diseases and substance use disorder
- Hospital revenue stabilized despite volume fluctuations
- Health care sector employment grew 17% from 2014 to 2024, adding 20,000 jobs, even as total nonfarm employment declined 1.43%

Now the One Big Beautiful Bill Act threatens to reverse these gains:

| Projected Impact | Estimate |
|-----------------|----------|
| Federal Medicaid Funding Loss (10 years) | $6.6 billion |
| Annual Loss (when fully implemented) | ~$900 million |
| Coverage Loss (projected) | 56,000 to 94,000 residents |
| Work Mandate Coverage Loss | ~$240 million annually |

The West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy estimates that between **56,000 and 94,000 West Virginians could lose Medicaid coverage by 2034** under the bill's provisions. Work requirements alone could cut more than **$240 million per year** from the state's Medicaid funding. The enhanced ACA subsidies that kept marketplace insurance affordable are not extended in the reconciliation bill, threatening coverage for an additional 15,000 West Virginians.

**The Math Does Not Work**

RHTP will provide West Virginia approximately **$1 billion over five years**. Medicaid cuts will extract approximately **$6.6 billion over ten years**, with substantial losses beginning before RHTP's five-year period ends. The ratios are catastrophic:

- **RHTP funding represents approximately 15% of projected Medicaid losses** over the RHTP period
- Annual RHTP investment of ~$199 million cannot offset annual Medicaid losses approaching ~$900 million when fully implemented
- Rural hospitals already operating on negative margins will face accelerating losses regardless of transformation funding

This is the fundamental constraint West Virginia faces. RHTP cannot offset the Medicaid cuts created by the same legislation that established RHTP. The program can invest in new capabilities, but it cannot backfill revenue losses. It can build telehealth infrastructure, but it cannot replace insurance coverage for 94,000 people who may lose Medicaid.

Rich Sutphin, executive director of the West Virginia Rural Health Association, summarized the situation: **"We will see hospital closures."** The question is how many and how fast.

## Social Determinants and Structural Barriers

West Virginia's health crisis cannot be understood through healthcare metrics alone. The state's poor outcomes reflect **social determinants of health** that healthcare investment cannot directly address: poverty, education, housing, food security, transportation, and the accumulated trauma of economic collapse.

**Poverty and Economic Distress**

Per capita income in West Virginia averages approximately **$44,994** statewide, with rural per capita income lagging at **$40,872**. Multiple counties are classified as economically distressed by the Appalachian Regional Commission. Child poverty exceeds 20% statewide and reaches higher levels in southern counties. Persistent poverty, defined as poverty rates above 20% for at least 30 years, characterizes many of the state's rural counties.

Economic distress shapes health in multiple ways. Poverty limits food choices. Food insecurity drives reliance on cheap, calorie-dense, nutrient-poor foods that contribute to obesity and diabetes. Poverty limits housing options. Substandard housing contributes to respiratory disease, lead exposure, and mental health strain. Poverty limits transportation options. Without vehicles, residents cannot access healthcare facilities, employment, or social services.

The workforce participation rate in West Virginia ranks among the lowest nationally, and **poor health is the primary reason residents cite for not working**. This creates a vicious cycle: poor health prevents employment, lack of employment deepens poverty, poverty worsens health. Governor Morrisey's Health to Prosperity vision explicitly targets this cycle, arguing that health improvement is the prerequisite for workforce recovery.

**Food Environment**

West Virginia's food environment contributes to chronic disease burden. Rural areas lack grocery stores. Dollar stores and convenience stores provide most food access in many communities. Fresh produce is expensive, difficult to obtain, and requires refrigeration that some households cannot afford.

The state has pursued policy changes to the food environment, including:

- **House Bill 2354** requiring healthier school meals and banning certain food dyes
- **SNAP reforms** linking education and employment to improved nutrition
- A **USDA waiver** removing soda as an entitlement under the SNAP program

These policies reflect Governor Morrisey's **four-pillar health initiative**: Clean Up the Food, Find Purpose/Find Health, Move Your Body/Change Your Life, and Reward Healthy Choices. The approach emphasizes personal responsibility and lifestyle modification alongside healthcare access.

**Geographic Isolation**

The lack of public transportation between communities isolates rural West Virginians from healthcare, employment, and social services. Many residents do not own vehicles. Those who do face long drives on winding mountain roads that become hazardous in winter. Emergency response times stretch dangerously long. Ambulances traveling to remote hollows may take an hour to reach patients experiencing cardiac events or strokes.

Non-emergency medical transportation (NEMT) exists but is inadequate. Coordination between NEMT, public transit where it exists, and community transportation programs is fragmented. Patients miss appointments because rides do not arrive. Dialysis patients requiring three-times-weekly treatment face particular hardship.

**Substance Use Disorder**

The opioid crisis transformed West Virginia's health landscape. Substance use disorder affects a substantial portion of the population, with ripple effects on families, communities, and the healthcare system. Treatment requires travel to regional centers. Recovery support services are limited. The intersection of addiction, mental health, economic despair, and social isolation creates complex care needs that rural health systems are poorly equipped to address.

## What RHTP Must Address

West Virginia's RHTP application, developed through public input including three roundtables with over 36 healthcare organizations and a statewide tele-townhall with more than **17,000 participants**, identifies seven flagship initiatives:

1. **Connected Care Grid**: Telehealth, remote monitoring, mobile care, EMS treatment-in-place
2. **Rural Health Link**: Unified medical transportation platform
3. **Mountain State Care Force**: Healthcare workforce recruitment and retention
4. **Smart Care Catalyst**: Technology grants, value-based care transition
5. **Health to Prosperity Pipeline**: Recovery-to-work and health-to-work programs
6. **Personal Health Accelerator**: Food-as-medicine, prevention, lifestyle programs
7. **HealthTech Appalachia**: Health innovation incubator

The initiatives address real needs. Transportation barriers, workforce shortages, chronic disease burden, substance use disorder, and technology gaps all appear in the plan. The **West Virginia Department of Health** serves as lead agency, with **Dr. Arvin Singh** as Secretary of Health directing implementation.

Whether $199 million annually can accomplish the stated goals is the question Part 2 will examine. The application was developed with assistance from **McKinsey and Company** at a cost of $2 million to the state, and more than **40 healthcare organizations** endorsed the plan. Ambition is not lacking. Resources may be.

## The Political Context

Governor Patrick Morrisey, who assumed office in January 2025, brings an attorney general's background to health policy. His prior experience includes extensive litigation against pharmaceutical companies over the opioid crisis. He has praised President Trump, Secretary Kennedy, and Dr. Oz for supporting state-driven rural health solutions.

Morrisey has disputed estimates that OBBBA will result in $900 million in annual losses, arguing that improving the health of the state will lower medical issues and reduce Medicaid costs. This view, while optimistic, runs counter to the projections of organizations ranging from the Congressional Budget Office to the Kaiser Family Foundation to the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy.

West Virginia Senators Shelley Moore Capito and Jim Justice have supported the One Big Beautiful Bill, with Capito citing the need to address fraud, waste, and abuse in Medicaid. Neither has quantified fraud in West Virginia that would justify the projected coverage losses. The political alignment between state and federal leadership means West Virginia is unlikely to challenge OBBBA implementation or seek protections beyond what the legislation provides.

## The 2030 Question

RHTP funding ends after five years unless Congress reauthorizes and appropriates additional resources. West Virginia must build systems that survive the 2030 funding cliff, even as Medicaid cuts accelerate in parallel.

The state's application emphasizes creating **permanent infrastructure that rewards results, not volume**. But permanent infrastructure requires ongoing funding. Telehealth platforms need maintenance. Workforce pipelines need continued investment in training slots. Transportation coordination requires sustained operational support. Prevention programs cannot run on expired grants.

Sustainability beyond 2030 requires one of three outcomes:

1. **State commitment** to ongoing investment from general funds
2. **Payer willingness** to support transformed care models at rates that cover costs
3. **Federal program extension** through congressional reauthorization

West Virginia faces severe state budget constraints, with a Medicaid shortfall of $147 million in fiscal year 2025 preceding RHTP implementation. Payer rates, dominated by Medicare and Medicaid, are set by federal policy rather than state negotiation. Federal reauthorization depends on political conditions impossible to predict five years out.

What happens in 2031 if RHTP ends and Medicaid cuts have fully implemented? Hospitals built new telehealth capacity with RHTP funds but face reduced patient revenue. Workforce pipelines trained providers who leave for other states. Transportation coordination existed briefly, then collapsed when funding ended. Prevention programs launched, showed promise, then closed.

This is not inevitable. But it is plausible. West Virginia must distinguish between investments that create durable change and investments that merely postpone the reckoning.

## Conclusion

West Virginia will receive $199.5 million in fiscal year 2026, the first installment of approximately $1 billion over five years, to transform a rural health system where 15 hospitals are at risk of closure, six face immediate closure within three years, and health outcomes are the worst or near worst in the nation across multiple categories. The funding places West Virginia in the upper tier of RHTP recipients. It places West Virginia last or near last in nearly every health ranking that matters.

This is the West Virginia paradox. The state receives substantial federal investment because its need is severe. **Its need is so severe that the investment may prove insufficient.** $181 per rural resident in FY2026 cannot offset the projected $6.6 billion in Medicaid cuts over ten years. $909 per rural resident over five years cannot rebuild a health system hollowed out by a century of extraction economics, decades of population decline, and the cumulative weight of the opioid crisis.

Governor Morrisey's Health to Prosperity vision represents an attempt to break the cycle connecting poor health, workforce nonparticipation, and economic stagnation. The seven flagship initiatives target real barriers: transportation, workforce, technology, chronic disease, substance use disorder, and prevention. The application emerged from extensive public engagement and stakeholder consultation.

But transformation requires more than vision. It requires resources adequate to the task. The fundamental tension between RHTP investment and Medicaid cuts may prove irresolvable. The hospitals most at risk serve the communities least able to absorb their loss. The patients most in need are those most likely to lose coverage under OBBBA's provisions.

What happens next depends on implementation choices. Will West Virginia deploy RHTP funding strategically, building regional networks, accelerating workforce pipelines, and connecting health improvement to economic opportunity? Or will funding flow to politically connected recipients without regard to impact? Will the state supplement federal investment or rely entirely on RHTP dollars? Will external conditions stabilize, giving initiatives time to demonstrate results, or will Medicaid cuts and hospital closures accelerate faster than transformation can respond?

These are not rhetorical questions. They are the questions that will determine whether rural West Virginians in 2031 have access to healthcare or whether the system has collapsed under the weight of contradictory federal policies.

Part 2 of this analysis examines West Virginia's seven-initiative RHTP plan: what the state proposes to build with $199 million, how the Connected Care Grid, Rural Health Link, and Mountain State Care Force translate intent into implementation, and whether the Health to Prosperity vision can succeed when the math works against it.
