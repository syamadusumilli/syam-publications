# RHTP 3.OH.3: Ohio
## The Analysis

*Series 3: State Implementation*

## Introduction

Part 1 established the context: **$202 million for fiscal year 2026**, average funding for 4.4 million rural residents concentrated in 73 non-urban counties, with particular crisis in 32 Appalachian counties. Part 2 documented the plan: Rural Health Innovation Hubs, Emergency Care Transformation, School-Based Health Centers, the OH SEE Program, and the Rural Workforce Pipeline.

This analysis asks whether it will work.

Not whether RHTP funding improves Ohio's rural health system. Any investment in resource-starved systems produces marginal improvement. The question is whether **$46 per rural resident annually** produces transformation or merely visible activity. Whether incremental improvement substitutes for structural change. Whether Ohio designed a plan that matches funding to need, or a plan that matches ambition to political feasibility while ignoring what transformation would actually require.

The argument of this analysis: Ohio made a **political calculation disguised as strategic planning**. The state designed a plan that won't fail dramatically because it avoids controversial choices, ambitious goals, and dependencies on factors beyond state control. The same caution that prevents spectacular failure prevents meaningful transformation. Ohio will achieve what it set out to achieve: visible progress that justifies RHTP funding and protects against criticism. Rural Ohioans will experience marginally better access. And in 2031, when federal funding ends and Medicaid cuts accelerate, core problems will remain unsolved.

This isn't failure. It's the predictable result of prioritizing **political defense over transformation**. Whether that represents strategic realism or collective failure of imagination depends on whether you believe incremental improvement is the best available option or an excuse for avoiding difficult choices.

## What Works

### School-Based Health Center Expansion

The school-based health center initiative works because it aligns **political incentives, implementation simplicity, and federal scoring priorities** into a single strategy.

**Why it works:**

**Political value is immediate and visible.** Centers can be photographed with ribbon-cutting ceremonies. Legislators can point to infrastructure in their districts. Parents can see healthcare delivered where their children already attend. Children generate bipartisan sympathy that adult healthcare investments struggle to achieve.

**Implementation pathway is clear.** Ohio already operates school-based health centers. The model is proven. Partner identification (schools, healthcare systems) follows established patterns. Staffing requirements are documented. Billing procedures exist. RHTP funding allows doing more of what Ohio already knows how to do.

**Federal scoring rewards the approach.** CMS prioritized initiatives targeting youth, chronic disease prevention, and visible community infrastructure. School-based centers satisfy all three criteria while producing measurable outputs (centers opened, students served, visits completed).

**Governor DeWine's explicit emphasis** signals state-level political commitment. If RHTP funding falls short or implementation challenges arise, school-based health centers will be protected. This is Ohio's flagship initiative.

**Expected outcome:** 20-30 new school-based health centers operational by 2030, serving 15,000-25,000 students annually with primary, behavioral, dental, and telehealth services. Geographic distribution will favor districts with political champions and strong school superintendents, not necessarily areas of greatest clinical need.

**Sustainability pathway:** School-based centers can bill Medicaid and private insurance for services delivered. School districts may absorb operating costs as part of student support services. The model can survive federal funding expiration if reimbursement rates cover costs.

### Enhanced Loan Repayment for Targeted Professions

Ohio's existing loan repayment infrastructure through the Primary Care Office enables quick deployment of enhanced awards.

**Why it works:**

**Infrastructure exists.** Ohio already administers physician loan repayment. RHTP allows expanding to dentists, nurses, behavioral health providers, and other shortage professions. The bureaucratic apparatus is operational. No new program creation required.

**Incentive economics are proven.** Loan repayment influences career decisions when awards are sufficiently large. Ohio's enhancement to **$100,000-$150,000 over three to five years** for physicians competes with neighboring states and other rural opportunities.

**Results occur within RHTP window.** Unlike medical school pipeline investments that produce physicians after 2030, loan repayment retains providers by 2027. The provider begins serving rural Ohio immediately upon accepting the award.

**Metrics are straightforward.** Count providers recruited. Track retention rates. Document patient volume. CMS reporting is satisfied with concrete numbers.

**Expected outcome:** 50-100 additional providers retained through enhanced loan repayment over five years, concentrated in Health Professional Shortage Areas. Some providers will leave post-obligation. Others will establish practices that persist beyond service requirements.

**Sustainability pathway:** State general fund appropriations can continue loan repayment post-2030 if legislature values workforce retention. The Ohio Hospital Association and employer lobbies support continuation because they need workers.

### OH SEE Program Scaling

The **OH SEE** (Ohio Schools Eye Exams) program's expansion builds on demonstrated success from a 13-county pilot, extending mobile vision, hearing, and dental care statewide.

**Why it works:**

**Proven model exists.** The pilot demonstrated implementation feasibility and documented outcomes. Scaling proven interventions succeeds more reliably than launching untested approaches.

**Early intervention produces long-term value.** Identifying vision, hearing, and dental problems in children prevents educational impairment and more expensive treatment later. The economic case for prevention is strong.

**Mobile delivery addresses geographic barriers.** Rather than requiring rural families to travel to providers, providers travel to schools. The model inverts the access equation.

**Expected outcome:** Statewide coverage of mobile vision, hearing, and dental screening for K-12 students in rural counties by 2028, with treatment referral pathways to address identified problems.

**Sustainability challenge:** Mobile programs require ongoing operational funding. Reimbursement for screening services may not cover deployment costs. Post-2030 continuation depends on state appropriation or integration into school health budgets.

### Emergency Care Transformation in High-Capacity Areas

Ohio's Emergency Care Transformation initiative, enabling EMS to provide treat-in-place or alternate-destination care, works where **system capacity and training infrastructure align**.

**Why it works in favorable conditions:**

**Successful pilot provides template.** Ohio scaled from an existing pilot demonstrating feasibility. Implementation lessons are documented. Training curricula exist. Protocol development is complete.

**Reduced emergency department burden benefits hospitals.** Rural EDs operating at capacity or with staffing shortages benefit when EMS diverts non-emergency cases to alternative destinations or treats in place. Hospital administrators support the approach.

**Community paramedicine aligns with workforce realities.** Training existing EMS personnel to provide expanded services is faster than recruiting new providers. The workforce already exists; capabilities expand.

**Expected outcome:** Expanded treat-in-place and alternate-destination protocols across well-resourced EMS systems, reducing unnecessary emergency department utilization by 10-15% in implementation areas.

**Geographic limitation:** Rural EMS systems vary dramatically in capacity. Well-funded systems near urban cores can implement transformation. Volunteer EMS agencies serving frontier counties lack baseline capacity for expanded roles.

## What Struggles

### Rural Health Innovation Hubs in Competitive Markets

The **Clinically Integrated Network (CIN)** model underlying Rural Health Innovation Hubs faces implementation barriers that RHTP funding alone cannot overcome.

**Why it struggles:**

**Competition trumps coordination.** Ohio's rural healthcare landscape includes competing hospital systems, independent FQHCs, and private practices with conflicting economic interests. Hospitals and FQHCs compete for the same patients. Physicians employed by one system resist referrals to another. The collaborative ethos that innovation hubs require contradicts market dynamics that shaped existing relationships.

**Governance structures are ambiguous.** Who leads the hub? Who makes decisions when partners disagree? How are savings distributed? These questions lack clear answers in Ohio's application. Implementation will require negotiating governance arrangements that may prove impossible among competitive organizations.

**Technology interoperability remains unsolved.** Hubs require information sharing across organizations using different electronic health records, different billing systems, different quality metrics. Ohio plans "interoperable electronic medical records across initiatives" but interoperability has eluded healthcare for decades despite enormous investment.

**Care coordination doesn't generate revenue.** The activities that make hubs valuable, coordinating care across providers to reduce duplication and prevent deterioration, don't produce billable events under fee-for-service payment. Value-based payment models theoretically reward coordination, but Ohio's rural areas lack robust value-based payment infrastructure.

**Expected outcome:** 2-4 pilot hubs operational in areas with pre-existing collaborative relationships, demonstrating concept feasibility without achieving regional transformation. Most rural counties see no hub services.

**What gets cut:** Advanced care coordination platforms replaced with simpler tools. Population health analytics simplified to basic reporting. Community health worker integration delayed. The vision of comprehensive regional coordination becomes pilot projects at willing sites.

### Workforce Pipeline Long-Term Investments

Medical school partnerships and pipeline development from high school through professional training struggle because **timelines exceed RHTP window**.

**Why it struggles:**

**Medical education takes years.** A student entering expanded rural training in 2026 graduates in 2030, completes residency by 2033-2035, and begins rural practice thereafter. RHTP funding ends before any pipeline investment produces practicing physicians.

**Medical schools have competing priorities.** Ohio State, Northeast Ohio Medical University, and Ohio University Heritage College balance rural training against research, clinical excellence, and urban training that generates more revenue and prestige. RHTP funding can pay for expanded rural rotations but cannot compel institutional transformation.

**Preceptor capacity constrains expansion.** Rural physicians willing and able to supervise medical students are already overworked. Adding training responsibilities to clinical loads requires either reducing patient care or hiring additional providers to create teaching capacity.

**Expected outcome:** Modest increases in existing rural rotations. Limited new preceptorships at sites with capacity. No structural change to medical school programs. The fundamental pipeline problem remains unsolved.

**What gets cut:** Ambitious high-school-through-professional-school pipeline development. Mentorship programs for rural students. Scholarships for undergraduates interested in healthcare careers. Long-term investments producing no RHTP-period results face elimination.

### Technology Deployment in Unconnected Areas

Ohio's cross-cutting technology strategy, embedding telehealth, remote monitoring, and EHR interoperability across initiatives, fails where **infrastructure prerequisites don't exist**.

**Why it struggles:**

**Broadband gaps persist.** Appalachian Ohio counties include some of the least-connected areas in the state. RHTP assumes federal broadband programs expand rural connectivity. If broadband expansion stalls, technology initiatives become equipment sitting unused.

**Digital literacy varies.** Rural populations include high proportions of elderly residents with limited technology familiarity. Remote monitoring devices require patients capable of using them. Telehealth visits require patients comfortable with video technology.

**Provider adoption lags equipment deployment.** Purchasing telehealth equipment is fast. Changing clinical workflows to incorporate telehealth is slow. Providers trained in in-person care resist workflow transformation even when equipment is available.

**Expected outcome:** Telehealth equipment deployed at major facilities. Utilization rates below expectations because connectivity, literacy, and workflow barriers persist. The technology exists but adoption lags.

## What Gets Cut

When funding constraints bite, medium-priority components face scaling decisions that reveal actual versus stated priorities.

### Innovation Hub Ambitious Elements

**Original vision:** 5-7 regional hubs coordinating care across networks of hospitals, FQHCs, and clinics with shared care plans, integrated care teams, and robust care coordination.

**Scaled reality:** 2-4 pilot sites testing basic elements with limited geographic reach. Advanced care coordination platforms replaced by simpler tools. Community health worker integration delayed to Year 4-5 if budget allows.

**Rationale for cutting:** Hubs are complex, expensive, and require substantial behavior change from competitive institutions. Time frames for demonstrating impact exceed political attention spans. When budget pressures intensify, hubs get scaled back because they're hard to explain, hard to implement, and hard to sustain.

### Medical School Rural Training Expansion

**Original vision:** Expanded rural tracks at all three Ohio medical schools with increased rotation placements, preceptorships at dozens of sites, and dedicated faculty.

**Scaled reality:** Modest increases in existing rotations. Limited new preceptorships at sites with capacity. No structural change to medical school programs.

**Rationale for cutting:** Front-end investment in medical school partnerships delays in favor of loan repayment producing quicker return. Medical school partnerships produce promises. Loan repayment produces metrics by 2027.

### EMS and Community Paramedicine in Under-Resourced Systems

**Original vision:** Statewide Emergency Care Transformation enabling treat-in-place and alternate-destination care across all rural EMS systems.

**Scaled reality:** Implementation in well-resourced systems near urban cores. Volunteer EMS agencies in frontier counties receive minimal support. Mobile health units delayed or eliminated.

**Rationale for cutting:** EMS transformation requires baseline capacity that many rural systems lack. RHTP cannot simultaneously build basic EMS infrastructure and transform it. Resources flow to systems capable of transformation rather than those needing basic support.

### Social Determinants Comprehensive Intervention

**Original vision:** Integration of social care into clinical delivery through community health worker deployment, social needs screening, and closed-loop referral systems.

**Scaled reality:** Social needs screening survives as data capture because federal reporting requires documentation. Resolution infrastructure doesn't survive because it lacks revenue and scoring weight.

**What survives:** Documentation that social needs were assessed.

**What doesn't survive:** Systematic resolution of transportation, housing, food insecurity, and other social determinants identified through screening.

## The Medicaid Mathematics

Every RHTP analysis must confront the fundamental contradiction: RHTP provides temporary funding while Medicaid cuts extract permanent revenue.

**The Numbers for Ohio:**

| Source | Amount | Timeline |
|--------|--------|----------|
| RHTP Funding | ~$1.01 billion | 2026-2030 (5 years) |
| Medicaid Cuts (Rural) | $5.6 billion | 2027-2036 (10 years) |
| Medicaid Cuts (Total) | $33 billion | 2027-2036 (10 years) |

RHTP provides approximately **18% of what Medicaid cuts extract** from Ohio's rural healthcare system. This is not offset. This is partial, temporary mitigation of permanent damage.

**Coverage implications:**

**270,000 Ohioans** projected to lose Medicaid coverage by 2034. Many will lose coverage not because they fail work requirements but because they fail documentation requirements. Ohio's rural hospitals, already operating with 72% at zero or negative margins, will see **uncompensated care costs increase 19-22%**.

**Timeline mismatch:**

RHTP provides peak funding from 2026-2028. Work requirements take effect in 2027. Provider tax reductions begin in 2028. The transformation funding arrives before the cuts bite. By 2031, transformation funding ends while Medicaid cuts continue accelerating through 2034.

**The practical implication:** Ohio must build healthcare infrastructure from 2026-2030 that survives revenue reduction from 2028-2034. Every initiative must answer: Can this persist when Medicaid revenue declines?

## Social Care Survival Assessment

Ohio's application emphasized social determinants, community health workers, and cross-sector collaboration. What survives partial funding?

### What Survives

**Social needs screening** survives because federal reporting requires documentation. Ohio will capture data on transportation barriers, food insecurity, housing instability, and social isolation. The data satisfies CMS requirements.

**Basic community health worker deployment** survives where CHWs integrate into existing care teams at FQHCs and school-based health centers. CHWs add value in settings with established infrastructure supporting their work.

### What Doesn't Survive

**Dedicated social care navigators** connecting patients to community resources don't generate billable revenue. Without dedicated funding, navigator positions don't get created.

**Closed-loop referral infrastructure** tracking whether social needs referrals result in service delivery requires technology investment and ongoing operational support. Tracking systems cost money without generating revenue.

**Community Information Exchange platforms** linking healthcare to social services require significant procurement and integration costs. CIE procurement delays or cancels.

### The Uncomfortable Reality

Social care components survive as **documentation without resolution**. Ohio will screen for social needs and record the results. Whether those needs get addressed depends on community resources existing independently of RHTP, not on systematic intervention funded by transformation dollars.

## Stated vs. Actual Priorities

Budget allocation and implementation choices reveal what Ohio actually values versus what application rhetoric emphasizes.

**Stated priority:** Comprehensive transformation of rural healthcare through innovation, technology, and cross-sector collaboration.

**Actual priority:** Visible wins demonstrating RHTP value through school-based health centers and workforce loan repayment.

**Stated priority:** Addressing Appalachian health disparities through targeted intervention in highest-need counties.

**Actual priority:** Geographic distribution favoring politically important districts with capable implementation partners regardless of clinical need.

**Stated priority:** Building sustainable infrastructure that persists beyond federal funding.

**Actual priority:** Launching initiatives that demonstrate progress within political timelines, with sustainability planning deferred.

**Stated priority:** Transforming care delivery through clinically integrated networks and regional coordination.

**Actual priority:** Piloting hub concepts at willing sites while core system fragmentation persists.

The gap between stated and actual priorities isn't hypocrisy. It's pragmatism. Ohio health officials know what can be accomplished within political, financial, and timeline constraints. Application language describes aspirations. Implementation choices reflect constraints.

## The 2030 Cliff Assessment

RHTP funding expires after fiscal year 2030. What survives?

### Likely to Survive

**School-based health centers** with sustainable billing relationships and school district commitment. Centers demonstrating value become embedded in school operations.

**Workforce loan repayment recipients** already practicing in rural Ohio. Providers who accept awards serve obligated time and potentially remain permanently.

**Technology infrastructure** deployed during RHTP period. Equipment purchased doesn't disappear. Whether it gets used depends on ongoing operational support.

**OH SEE program** if integrated into school health budgets or sustained through state appropriation.

### Unlikely to Survive

**Innovation hubs** lacking sustainable revenue models. Care coordination doesn't generate revenue under current payment systems. Without federal funding, hubs lose operational capacity.

**Community health worker positions** funded directly by RHTP without integration into sustainable care delivery models.

**Ambitious technology initiatives** requiring ongoing vendor relationships, software licensing, and technical support.

**Pipeline programs** producing results after 2030 and requiring continued investment.

### The Political Question

What Ohio builds from 2026-2030 must demonstrate sufficient value that state legislature and federal government choose to continue support. Initiatives producing visible, measurable results position for continuation. Initiatives producing diffuse benefits struggle to justify ongoing investment.

The political test: Can advocates point to specific improvements attributable to RHTP when requesting continued funding? School-based health centers pass this test. Innovation hubs producing "coordination" probably don't.

## Lessons for Other States

Ohio's experience offers lessons for states facing similar constraints.

### What States Should Do

**Match strategy to funding reality.** Ohio's $46 per rural resident cannot transform healthcare for 4.4 million people. Concentrate resources geographically rather than attempting statewide transformation at insufficient intensity.

**Prioritize initiatives with clear sustainability pathways.** School-based health centers can survive on reimbursement. Coordination hubs cannot. Design for post-2030 reality from inception.

**Build political coalitions now.** Start cultivating legislative support for state appropriations immediately. Don't wait until 2029 when federal funding is ending.

**Document outcomes obsessively.** CMS will evaluate progress for annual funding decisions. States producing metrics demonstrating value position for continued and potentially increased allocation.

**Accept partial success.** RHTP cannot solve structural problems. Acknowledge what's achievable and communicate realistic expectations.

### What States Should Avoid

**Overpromising transformation.** Application rhetoric sets expectations. Failure to deliver destroys trust. Realistic goals honestly communicated build credibility for future investment.

**Assuming funding alone solves problems.** Structural barriers require policy changes, not just money. Scope of practice restrictions, payment models, and hospital economics constrain what funding can accomplish.

**Deferring sustainability planning.** Initiatives should launch only if sustainable funding is identified or program can achieve goals within five years.

**Treating rural communities as homogeneous.** Appalachian poverty differs from agricultural decline differs from exurban growth. Local context matters. One-size-fits-all approaches fail.

**Ignoring social determinants after documenting them.** Screening for social needs without capacity to address them creates data without value and frustrates patients who identify needs that aren't met.

## Conclusion

Ohio designed a **politically safe plan prioritizing visible progress over structural change**. The three pillars and supporting initiatives are sensible, conventional, and achievable within five years and $202 million. None will transform rural health in Ohio. Together they will improve it at the margins, helping specific communities and specific populations while leaving core problems unsolved.

This is **incrementalism as strategy**. Ohio submitted an average application, received average funding, and designed an average response. The result matches inputs: adequate to show progress, insufficient to solve problems.

**What works:** School-based health centers serving students in participating districts. Enhanced loan repayment retaining providers in shortage areas. OH SEE program expansion reaching more children with screening services. Emergency Care Transformation in systems with baseline capacity.

**What struggles:** Innovation hubs facing competitive market dynamics. Workforce pipelines producing providers after RHTP ends. Technology deployment in areas lacking connectivity infrastructure.

**What gets cut:** Ambitious hub coordination platforms. Long-term pipeline development. Comprehensive social care resolution. Innovation in under-resourced EMS systems.

**Social care survives as documentation**, not delivery. Ohio captures social needs data through screening. It does not fund systematic resolution of those needs.

**The Medicaid mathematics doom structural transformation.** RHTP provides $1 billion over five years. Medicaid cuts extract $5.6 billion from rural Ohio over ten years. The math doesn't work. Ohio can improve at the margins while the foundation erodes.

**The 2030 cliff structures everything.** Whatever Ohio builds must survive funding expiration. School-based health centers may persist. Innovation hubs probably won't. The five-year horizon constrains what's worth attempting.

For 4.4 million rural Ohioans, RHTP will produce marginally better access from 2026-2030. For families whose children see doctors at school, this matters. For communities retaining a physician through loan repayment, this is valuable. For rural Ohioans whose hospitals close despite transformation rhetoric, whose specialists remain 90 minutes away, whose Medicaid coverage is cut while transformation funds expire, RHTP will feel like another inadequate federal response to deep structural problems.

**Final judgment: Cautiously pessimistic.** Ohio's plan will work within its limited ambitions. It will produce measurable improvements in access to primary care, workforce recruitment, and child health services. These improvements will not be sufficient to transform rural health outcomes or address root causes of rural healthcare failure.

Ohio chose realism over risk. Average funding for an average approach to an average crisis producing average results. Rural Ohioans deserved transformation. They got incrementalism.

The bet Ohio made, that visible progress is enough, will be tested by 2031 when federal funding ends and Medicaid cuts accelerate. Either incremental improvement satisfies rural communities, or the gap between rhetoric and reality produces political backlash. Implementation will reveal which.
