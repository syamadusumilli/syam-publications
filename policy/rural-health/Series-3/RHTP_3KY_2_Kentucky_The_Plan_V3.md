# RHTP 3.KY.2: Kentucky, The Plan

## Five Initiatives, $213 Million, and the Team Kentucky Promise

*Series 3: State Implementation*

Kentucky's Rural Health Transformation Plan received **$212,908,935 for fiscal year 2026**, the ninth highest award nationally and the full amount requested. Governor Andy Beshear announced the award on December 29, 2025, emphasizing that Kentucky's application was "accepted in full" and would help offset the impact of federal Medicaid cuts that threaten the state's rural healthcare infrastructure.

Part 1 documented Kentucky's rural health crisis: 35 rural hospitals at risk of closure (the most of any state nationally), maternity care deserts affecting one in six women of childbearing age, behavioral health shortages straining emergency departments and first responders, and Appalachian counties with life expectancy below 70 years. The state expanded Medicaid in 2014, providing crucial coverage to approximately 850,000 Kentuckians, but the One Big Beautiful Bill Act's Medicaid cuts threaten to extract **$12.3 billion from Kentucky's rural areas over the next decade**, more than any other state.

Kentucky's strategic response emphasizes **five interconnected innovation models** targeting the Commonwealth's most severe health disparities. The **Kentucky Department for Public Health (KDPH)** within the **Cabinet for Health and Family Services (CHFS)** leads implementation, guided by an interdisciplinary "A3 Team" coordinating planning, financial oversight, and performance management. The state's vision: every rural Kentuckian achieving their full human potential within communities that thrive.

This analysis examines Kentucky's five-initiative structure, the governance framework driving implementation, partner organizations positioned to receive funding, and the assumptions underlying the state's strategic bet.

## The Strategic Framework

### Governance Structure

The **Kentucky Department for Public Health** serves as lead implementing agency, with **Commissioner Dr. John Langefeld** providing executive oversight. KDPH operates within the **Cabinet for Health and Family Services**, led by **Secretary Dr. Steven Stack**. This placement integrates RHTP implementation with Kentucky's broader public health infrastructure and Medicaid administration.

Kentucky established an **A3 Team** (Aspire, Activate, Attain) as the operational coordinating body. The A3 framework reflects continuous improvement methodology adapted for health transformation:

**Aspire**: Defines strategic vision and outcome targets for each initiative
**Activate**: Coordinates implementation across state agencies and community partners
**Attain**: Monitors performance metrics and manages rapid-cycle learning

The A3 Team structure allows **local flexibility while maintaining statewide accountability**. Communities adapt models to their specific needs while contributing to aggregate Commonwealth goals. This approach acknowledges regional variation between Appalachian eastern Kentucky, agricultural western Kentucky, and suburban northern Kentucky.

CHFS agencies supporting implementation include:

| Agency | RHTP Role |
|--------|-----------|
| Kentucky Department for Public Health | Lead agency, initiative oversight |
| Department for Medicaid Services | Coverage coordination, payment integration |
| Department for Behavioral Health, Developmental and Intellectual Disabilities | Behavioral health initiative support |
| Office of Health Data and Analytics | Performance measurement, data connectivity |

Governor Beshear's office maintains strategic oversight through the **Office of Health Innovation**, ensuring RHTP priorities align with broader administration goals.

### Theory of Change

Kentucky's RHTP rests on several interconnected propositions:

**Technology extends access where workforce cannot scale.** Telehealth, remote monitoring, and mobile services enable specialists to reach rural populations without requiring provider relocation. This assumption reflects pragmatic acceptance that Kentucky cannot train or recruit sufficient providers to eliminate shortages within the five-year program window.

**Hub-and-spoke models create sustainable coordination.** Local community hubs anchor regional networks, connecting rural residents to specialty services through referral pathways, telehealth bridges, and mobile teams. Hubs leverage existing trusted relationships while expanding access to resources beyond local capacity.

**Prevention investment reduces downstream acute care burden.** Chronic disease management, particularly for obesity and diabetes, reduces emergency department utilization and prevents complications that overwhelm rural hospital capacity. This assumption aligns with MAHA initiative priorities emphasizing root cause intervention.

**Workforce pipelines require long-term cultivation.** Training programs, externships, and retention incentives build workforce capacity that persists beyond RHTP funding. Kentucky invests in "growing its own" through partnerships with academic institutions and community colleges.

**Community-based teams bridge clinical care and social support.** Maternal care teams, behavioral health responders, and dental hygiene networks integrate clinical services with community connections. Non-clinical staff extend the reach of scarce specialists.

These propositions reflect lessons from Kentucky's Medicaid expansion experience: coverage alone did not transform health outcomes in Appalachia. Access requires infrastructure, workforce, and community engagement beyond insurance enrollment.

## Program Allocation Table

**Note**: Kentucky published its full RHTP application publicly at RuralHealthPlan.ky.gov. Budget allocations reflect state documentation and may be refined during implementation planning.

| Initiative | Focus Area | Estimated FY2026 Allocation | Lead Organization | Key Deliverables |
|------------|------------|----------------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Rural Community Hubs for Chronic Care Innovation | Prevention/Chronic Disease | $35-45 million | KDPH, regional hub partners | Hub networks in target counties; diabetes/obesity management enrollment; nutrition and physical activity integration |
| PoWERing Maternal and Infant Health | Maternal Health/Access | $40-50 million | KDPH, UK/UofL Health, FQHCs | Maternal care teams deployed to maternity deserts; telehealth prenatal/postpartum capacity; reduced travel burden for high-risk pregnancies |
| Rapid Response to Recovery (EmPATH Model) | Behavioral Health/Crisis | $45-55 million | KDPH, CMHCs, UK HealthCare | Mobile crisis response teams; telepsychiatry expansion; EmPATH unit replication; ED diversion for behavioral health crises |
| Rooted in Health: Rural Dental Access | Oral Health/Workforce | $25-35 million | KDPH, dental hygiene programs, FQHCs | Expanded dental hygiene training; portable/tele-dental clinics; Appalachian oral health outreach |
| Crisis to Care: Integrated EMS Response | Emergency Services/Care Coordination | $30-40 million | KDPH, Kentucky Board of EMS, hospitals | Treat-in-place protocols; EMS data connectivity; paramedic training and workforce development |
| Program Administration and Evaluation | Operations | $15-20 million | KDPH A3 Team | Staffing; performance monitoring; technical assistance; reporting |

**Total: Approximately $212.9 million (FY2026)**

## Initiative 1: Rural Community Hubs for Chronic Care Innovation

**Estimated Budget**: $35-45 million annually over five years

### Design and Mechanics

The Rural Community Hubs initiative establishes **local "hub-and-spoke" collaboratives** focused on chronic disease prevention and management. Initial priority targets **obesity and diabetes**, conditions driving disproportionate morbidity and mortality in rural Kentucky. Hub design integrates nutrition programming, physical activity promotion, and digital self-management tools within community-based settings.

**Hub Structure**

Each hub serves as a coordination center for a defined geographic area, typically multiple counties. Hubs connect to smaller "spoke" sites including rural health clinics, FQHCs, primary care practices, and community organizations. The hub provides:

**Clinical coordination**: Care management for patients with chronic conditions
**Nutrition services**: Dietitian consultation, cooking classes, food access navigation
**Physical activity programming**: Fitness classes, walking groups, recreation coordination
**Digital health tools**: Remote monitoring devices, self-management applications, telehealth connectivity
**Community health worker deployment**: Navigation assistance, follow-up, social support connection

Spoke sites provide direct patient contact points, referring complex cases to hub resources while maintaining local relationships.

### Target Population and Geography

Kentucky's chronic disease burden concentrates in **Appalachian counties** where poverty, food insecurity, and limited healthcare access compound health risks. The state reports that **17% of Kentuckians live with multiple chronic conditions**, compared with 11% nationally. Eastern Kentucky counties experience diabetes rates exceeding 15%, significantly above state and national averages.

Initial hub deployment prioritizes:

**Eastern Kentucky**: Perry, Knott, Letcher, Pike, Floyd, and surrounding counties
**Southern Kentucky**: Pulaski, Wayne, McCreary, and Cumberland region
**Western Kentucky**: Select agricultural counties with chronic disease burden

Urban-adjacent rural counties in northern Kentucky may receive secondary priority given proximity to metropolitan resources.

### Subawardees and Partners

| Organization | Hub Role | Estimated Allocation |
|--------------|----------|---------------------|
| University of Kentucky Healthcare | Clinical coordination, specialist consultation | $8-12 million |
| University of Louisville Health | Regional hub support, telehealth infrastructure | $6-10 million |
| Kentucky Primary Care Association | FQHC network coordination, spoke site integration | $5-8 million |
| Community Action Agencies | Nutrition programming, social services connection | $3-5 million |
| Local Health Departments | Public health integration, community outreach | Distributed |
| Kentucky Homeplace | Community health worker deployment | $3-5 million |

**Kentucky Homeplace** warrants particular attention as a nationally recognized model for community health worker deployment. Since 1994, Kentucky Homeplace has employed community health workers serving Appalachian counties, linking residents to healthcare services, social support, and health education. The RHTP builds on this existing infrastructure rather than creating parallel systems.

### Performance Metrics

**Process Measures**:
Hubs established and operational in target counties
Patients enrolled in chronic care management programs
Community health worker contacts completed
Telehealth encounters for nutrition/fitness consultation

**Outcome Measures**:
Diabetes control (A1C levels) among enrolled population
Weight reduction and BMI improvement
Emergency department utilization for chronic disease complications
Self-reported health status improvement

### What Success Looks Like

By 2030, rural Kentuckians with diabetes and obesity have **local access to coordinated chronic care management** without traveling to metropolitan centers. Hub networks demonstrate **reduced ED utilization for preventable complications**, improved metabolic control among enrolled populations, and sustainable community health worker capacity. Nutrition and physical activity programming becomes integrated with clinical care rather than operating as separate community services.

## Initiative 2: PoWERing Maternal and Infant Health

**Estimated Budget**: $40-50 million annually over five years

### Design and Mechanics

**PoWERing Maternal and Infant Health** deploys telehealth-enabled maternal care teams to expand prenatal and postpartum services in maternity care deserts. The initiative name emphasizes **Prenatal Outreach, Wellness, Equity, and Regional access** components designed to address Kentucky's severe maternal health disparities.

**Maternal Care Team Structure**

Each team includes:

**Nurse-midwife or advanced practice provider**: Clinical lead for prenatal/postpartum care
**Registered nurse**: Direct patient care, triage, follow-up
**Community health worker or doula**: Social support, transportation coordination, cultural connection
**Telehealth specialist**: Technical support for remote consultations

Teams operate from community hub sites, providing in-person services at local facilities while connecting high-risk patients to specialists through telehealth. The model reduces travel burden for routine prenatal visits while ensuring appropriate referral for complications.

**Telehealth Integration**

Remote monitoring enables early detection of preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, and other pregnancy complications. Patients receive home blood pressure cuffs, glucose monitors, and digital scales with data transmitted to care teams. Telehealth consultations connect rural patients to maternal-fetal medicine specialists at UK HealthCare and UofL Health without requiring travel to Lexington or Louisville.

### Target Population and Geography

Kentucky documents that **nearly one in six women of childbearing age lives in a maternity care desert**, more than four times the national average. Maternity deserts concentrate in:

**Eastern Appalachian counties**: Multiple hospitals have discontinued obstetric services in recent years
**South-central Kentucky**: Limited OB-GYN availability despite significant populations
**Western Kentucky**: Rural counties distant from regional hospitals with delivery services

The initiative explicitly targets **high-risk pregnancies** disproportionately affecting low-income, minority, and Medicaid-enrolled women. Kentucky's maternal mortality rates exceed national averages, with particular disparities affecting Black women and rural residents.

### Subawardees and Partners

| Organization | Maternal Health Role | Estimated Allocation |
|--------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| University of Kentucky HealthCare | Maternal-fetal medicine consultation, telehealth backbone | $10-15 million |
| University of Louisville Health | Regional specialist support, training | $8-12 million |
| FQHCs (via Kentucky Primary Care Association) | Community-based prenatal care sites | $8-12 million |
| Kentucky Perinatal Quality Collaborative | Quality improvement, outcome measurement | $2-4 million |
| Regional hospitals with OB services | Hub facilities, delivery referral | Distributed |

The **Kentucky Perinatal Quality Collaborative** coordinates quality improvement across birthing facilities statewide. RHTP investment strengthens collaborative infrastructure while extending quality improvement methodologies to community-based prenatal care sites.

### Performance Metrics

**Process Measures**:
Maternal care teams deployed and operational
Women enrolled in team-based prenatal care
Telehealth prenatal visits completed
High-risk referrals to specialists executed

**Outcome Measures**:
Prenatal care initiation (first trimester entry)
Adequate prenatal care (sufficient visit completion)
Preterm birth rates among enrolled population
Severe maternal morbidity
Infant mortality rates in target regions

### What Success Looks Like

By 2030, no Kentucky woman travels more than 60 minutes for routine prenatal care. High-risk pregnancies receive **specialist oversight through telehealth** without requiring relocation or extended travel. Maternal mortality rates in Appalachian Kentucky begin converging with state averages. Community-based maternal care teams become permanent fixtures of rural health infrastructure, sustained through Medicaid reimbursement for maternity bundled payments.

## Initiative 3: Rapid Response to Recovery (EmPATH Model)

**Estimated Budget**: $45-55 million annually over five years

### Design and Mechanics

**Rapid Response to Recovery** adapts the EmPATH (Emergency Psychiatric Assessment, Treatment and Healing) model for rural Kentucky, deploying **mobile crisis response teams, telepsychiatry services, and stabilization capacity** to connect individuals experiencing behavioral health crises to community-based treatment and recovery supports.

**The EmPATH Model**

EmPATH units provide an alternative to traditional emergency departments for psychiatric emergencies. UK HealthCare opened Kentucky's first EmPATH unit in July 2024 at Eastern State Hospital in Lexington. National data demonstrates that **60-70% of individuals treated in EmPATH units stabilize and return home within 24 hours**, with significantly higher rates of follow-up care engagement compared to ED-based psychiatric treatment.

Kentucky's RHTP extends this model through:

**Mobile crisis response**: Teams deploy to individuals in crisis rather than waiting for ED presentation
**Telepsychiatry**: Psychiatrists provide consultation and assessment through video connection to remote locations
**Community stabilization**: Short-term stabilization capacity in community settings rather than hospital admission
**Warm handoffs**: Direct connection from crisis stabilization to outpatient treatment and recovery supports

**Integration with 988 and Crisis Continuum**

The initiative coordinates with Kentucky's 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline implementation, ensuring mobile response capacity for calls requiring in-person intervention. Crisis continuum design connects emergency response, stabilization, and ongoing treatment as integrated pathway rather than fragmented episodes.

### Target Population and Geography

Kentucky's behavioral health workforce shortage concentrates crisis response burden on **emergency departments and first responders lacking specialized training**. Rural areas experience:

**Extended psychiatric boarding**: ED patients awaiting psychiatric beds for days or weeks
**Law enforcement transport burden**: Police driving hours to deliver individuals to state hospitals
**Substance use crisis**: Opioid overdoses requiring immediate response and treatment connection
**Suicide risk**: Kentucky's rural suicide rates exceed urban rates significantly

Mobile response teams prioritize regions with:
Limited community mental health center coverage
High ED behavioral health boarding rates
Significant overdose and substance use burden
Law enforcement behavioral health call volume

### Subawardees and Partners

| Organization | Behavioral Health Role | Estimated Allocation |
|--------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| UK HealthCare / Eastern State Hospital | EmPATH replication, telepsychiatry | $12-18 million |
| Community Mental Health Centers (CMHCs) | Mobile teams, community stabilization | $15-20 million |
| Kentucky Department for Behavioral Health | System coordination, state hospital integration | $5-8 million |
| New Vista Behavioral Health | Central Kentucky response, training | $3-5 million |
| Seven Counties Services | Louisville region support | $3-5 million |

Kentucky operates **14 Community Mental Health Centers** serving the state's 120 counties. CMHCs provide the workforce infrastructure for mobile response team deployment, drawing from existing clinical staff while RHTP funds expansion capacity.

### Performance Metrics

**Process Measures**:
Mobile crisis teams deployed and operational
Crisis calls resulting in community response (vs. ED transport)
Telepsychiatry consultations completed
Individuals stabilized without hospitalization

**Outcome Measures**:
ED psychiatric boarding hours
State hospital admission rates from rural counties
Follow-up treatment engagement rates
Repeat crisis contacts within 30 days
Suicide deaths in target regions

### What Success Looks Like

By 2030, rural Kentuckians experiencing behavioral health crises receive **response from trained mental health professionals rather than law enforcement as default**. ED boarding for psychiatric patients in rural hospitals decreases dramatically. EmPATH or equivalent stabilization capacity exists in multiple regions beyond Lexington. Crisis intervention connects to treatment as continuous pathway, reducing cycling between crisis and stabilization without sustained recovery support.

## Initiative 4: Rooted in Health: Rural Dental Access

**Estimated Budget**: $25-35 million annually over five years

### Design and Mechanics

**Rooted in Health** addresses Kentucky's severe oral health disparities through expanded dental hygiene training, externship programs, and portable or tele-dental clinics. Appalachian Kentucky experiences among the **lowest dental visit rates and highest rates of complete tooth loss among seniors** nationally.

**Dental Hygiene Training Pipeline**

The initiative expands dental hygiene program capacity at Kentucky community colleges and universities, creating training slots targeted for rural students with service commitments. Externship programs place students in rural health clinics, FQHCs, and community settings during training, building familiarity with rural practice before graduation.

**Portable and Tele-Dental Clinics**

Mobile dental units travel to communities lacking fixed dental facilities, providing preventive services, basic restorations, and specialty referral. Tele-dentistry enables hygienists to provide preventive care in remote settings with dentist oversight via video consultation. This model extends dental hygiene scope of practice within regulatory boundaries while maximizing limited dentist availability.

**School-Based Dental Programs**

Partnerships with school districts establish dental sealant programs and preventive care access for children, interrupting the cycle of poor oral health beginning in childhood. School-based programs reach children regardless of family dental insurance status or transportation access.

### Target Population and Geography

Oral health disparities concentrate in **Appalachian counties** where poverty, cultural factors, and historic lack of fluoridated water compound dental disease burden. Eastern Kentucky communities experience:

Complete tooth loss rates among seniors exceeding 40%
Childhood dental caries rates far exceeding state averages
Dental professional shortage areas covering entire regions
Travel times to dental providers exceeding one hour

### Subawardees and Partners

| Organization | Dental Access Role | Estimated Allocation |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| University of Kentucky College of Dentistry | Training expansion, tele-dentistry | $6-10 million |
| University of Louisville School of Dentistry | Regional training support | $4-6 million |
| KCTCS dental hygiene programs | Community college pipeline expansion | $5-8 million |
| FQHCs with dental programs | Portable clinic operation, training sites | $6-10 million |
| Remote Area Medical | Mobile dental clinic partnerships | $2-4 million |

**Remote Area Medical (RAM)** conducts free medical and dental clinics in underserved areas, including regular events in Appalachian Kentucky drawing thousands of patients. RHTP investment could support RAM integration with ongoing care coordination rather than episodic charity care.

### Performance Metrics

**Process Measures**:
Dental hygiene training slots created
Rural externship placements completed
Portable/tele-dental clinic visits delivered
School sealant program coverage

**Outcome Measures**:
Dental visit rates in target counties
Childhood caries rates (DMFT scores)
ED visits for dental conditions
Tooth loss rates among adults

### What Success Looks Like

By 2030, dental hygiene graduates with rural training and service commitment provide preventive care in communities previously lacking any dental access. Portable clinics establish regular schedules in underserved regions, reducing emergency dental visits and preventing disease progression. School-based programs reach majority of children in target counties, establishing preventive care habits from childhood.

## Initiative 5: Crisis to Care: Integrated EMS Response and Coordination

**Estimated Budget**: $30-40 million annually over five years

### Design and Mechanics

**Crisis to Care** enhances pre-hospital capacity and trauma coordination through treat-in-place protocols, improved data connectivity, and workforce training for rural EMS providers. Kentucky's emergency medical services face a distribution crisis: **nearly half of all paramedics concentrate in the state's five largest counties**, leaving rural areas with limited pre-hospital care capacity.

**Treat-in-Place Protocols**

Current EMS protocols often require transport to emergency departments for conditions that could be safely managed in place or through telehealth consultation. Treat-in-place protocols enable:

**Minor injury treatment**: Wound care, splinting, and discharge without transport
**Medication administration**: For known chronic conditions under protocol or telehealth guidance
**Referral to appropriate care**: Direct scheduling to primary care or urgent care rather than ED
**Telehealth consultation**: Physician or NP consultation supporting field decision-making

These protocols reduce unnecessary ED transports, freeing ambulances for genuine emergencies and connecting patients to appropriate care levels.

**EMS Data Connectivity**

Many rural EMS agencies operate with paper-based records disconnected from hospital and primary care electronic systems. The initiative funds:

**Electronic patient care reporting (ePCR)**: Digital documentation enabling data sharing
**Health information exchange integration**: EMS records flowing to hospital and clinic systems
**Quality improvement analytics**: Data supporting protocol refinement and outcome tracking
**Real-time communication**: Connectivity between field units, dispatch, and receiving facilities

**Workforce Training and Development**

EMS workforce development includes:

**Paramedic training scholarships**: Supporting career advancement from EMT-Basic to paramedic
**Continuing education**: Advanced protocols, behavioral health crisis response, treat-in-place training
**Retention incentives**: Loan repayment and bonuses for rural service commitment
**Leadership development**: Preparing EMS leaders for management and training roles

### Target Population and Geography

EMS capacity gaps affect **rural counties statewide**, with particular severity in:

**Eastern Kentucky**: Volunteer EMS agencies struggling to maintain coverage
**Western Kentucky**: Large geographic territories with limited unit availability
**Border counties**: Extended transport times to trauma centers

The initiative prioritizes regions where EMS response times significantly exceed urban benchmarks and where volunteer agencies face sustainability challenges.

### Subawardees and Partners

| Organization | EMS Role | Estimated Allocation |
|--------------|----------|---------------------|
| Kentucky Board of EMS | Protocol development, certification oversight | $4-6 million |
| Kentucky Community & Technical College System | Paramedic training programs | $8-12 million |
| Regional EMS agencies | Implementation, workforce deployment | $10-15 million |
| Kentucky Hospital Association | Trauma coordination, data integration | $4-6 million |
| Kentucky Telehealth Network | Field consultation infrastructure | $2-4 million |

### Performance Metrics

**Process Measures**:
EMS agencies implementing treat-in-place protocols
ePCR adoption among rural agencies
Paramedics trained through RHTP-funded programs
Telehealth consultations from field

**Outcome Measures**:
Unnecessary ED transport rates
EMS response times in target areas
Patient outcomes for treated-in-place conditions
EMS workforce retention in rural agencies

### What Success Looks Like

By 2030, rural Kentucky EMS provides **first-contact care rather than mere transport**. Treat-in-place protocols divert appropriate cases from overwhelmed emergency departments while ensuring genuine emergencies receive rapid transport. Data connectivity enables quality improvement across agencies previously isolated from feedback loops. Paramedic training pipeline produces graduates committed to rural service.

## Social Care Integration

### SDOH/HRSN Initiatives

Kentucky's RHTP integrates social determinants of health throughout initiatives rather than isolating SDOH as separate programming. This approach reflects Kentucky's existing "Our Healthy Kentucky Home" initiative emphasizing whole-person health.

**Social Care Integration by Initiative**:

| Initiative | SDOH Components |
|------------|----------------|
| Chronic Care Hubs | Nutrition programming, food access navigation, fitness access, transportation assistance |
| Maternal Health | Doula support, social support connection, housing stability screening, transportation coordination |
| Behavioral Health | Housing navigation, employment support, recovery support services, peer connection |
| Dental Access | School-based programs addressing family barriers |
| EMS Integration | Social needs screening during encounters, referral to community resources |

**HRSN Screening Requirements**

The application indicates standardized social needs screening across RHTP-funded programs, identifying housing, food, transportation, and utility needs. Screening connects to Kentucky's 211 system and community resource directories for closed-loop referral.

### Community Health Worker Programs

Community health workers feature prominently in Kentucky's plan, building on the **Kentucky Homeplace** model operating since 1994. CHW deployment appears throughout initiatives:

**Chronic Care Hubs**: CHWs provide navigation, follow-up, and social support connection
**Maternal Health Teams**: CHWs or doulas serve as team members for every maternal care team
**Behavioral Health**: Peer support specialists (functioning similarly to CHWs) provide recovery support

**CHW Funding and Supervision**:
KDPH will coordinate CHW deployment standards
Clinical supervision through hub organizations and CMHCs
Training aligned with national CHW competencies
Medicaid reimbursement pathway development for sustainability

**Estimated CHW Investment**: $10-15 million across initiatives

### Community Information Exchange and Referral Platforms

Kentucky's application references **closed-loop referral systems** connecting healthcare and social services. The state's existing infrastructure includes:

**Kentucky 211**: Statewide information and referral service
**Unite Us / Findhelp**: Commercial platforms with Kentucky deployments
**kynect**: State benefits portal including Medicaid, SNAP, and other programs

**Technology Platform Strategy**:
The application does not mandate a single CIE platform, allowing regional flexibility. RHTP funds support integration requirements ensuring interoperability rather than prescribing specific vendor solutions.

**Procurement Status**: Not specified; likely regional procurement processes as implementation planning advances.

## Technology Vendor Landscape

### Current SDOH/CIE Platforms in Kentucky

| Platform | Coverage | Current Status |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| Kentucky 211 | Statewide | Operational; potential integration hub |
| Unite Us | Regional deployments | Active in multiple markets |
| Findhelp | Regional deployments | Active; expanding |
| kynect benefits portal | Statewide | State-operated; Medicaid integration |

### RHTP Technology Requirements

The application emphasizes **interoperability and data connectivity** across initiatives:

**EHR integration**: CIE platforms connecting to Epic, Cerner, and other systems used by Kentucky healthcare organizations
**ePCR integration**: EMS data flowing to hospital and primary care systems
**Telehealth infrastructure**: Video consultation capacity across all initiatives
**Remote monitoring**: Device connectivity for chronic disease and maternal health programs

### Technology Investment Opportunities

Vendors with opportunities in Kentucky's RHTP implementation:

**Remote patient monitoring**: Chronic disease and maternal health programs require device and data management platforms
**Telehealth platforms**: Mental health, maternal health, and EMS consultation require video infrastructure
**Care management platforms**: Chronic care hubs need population health and care coordination tools
**CIE platforms**: Closed-loop referral capacity with healthcare integration
**ePCR systems**: EMS data modernization across rural agencies

## Budget Flow and Timeline

### Federal Fund Flow

CMS distributes RHTP funding annually based on:

**Baseline allocation**: 50% distributed equally among approved states
**Workload allocation**: 50% based on rurality, application quality, and policy alignment

Kentucky's $212.9 million FY2026 award reflects strong performance on CMS scoring factors. Future year funding depends on continued appropriations and compliance with performance requirements.

### State Distribution Mechanism

KDPH will operate as fiscal agent, distributing funds through:

**Direct contracts**: With major partners (UK, UofL, KPCA)
**Subaward processes**: Competitive or formula-based distribution to regional and local partners
**Procurement**: Technology platforms and equipment

**Two-Year Obligation Requirement**: RHTP funds must be obligated within two years of receipt. Kentucky's implementation timeline must accelerate partner selection and contracting to meet federal requirements.

### Implementation Timeline

| Phase | Timeframe | Activities |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| Planning | Q1 2026 | A3 Team staffing, partner agreements, workplan finalization |
| Launch | Q2-Q3 2026 | Initial hub sites operational, team deployment begins |
| Expansion | Q4 2026-2027 | Geographic expansion, full initiative operation |
| Maturation | 2028-2029 | Quality improvement, outcome optimization |
| Sustainability | 2030 | Transition planning, post-RHTP funding pathways |

### Administrative Costs

Kentucky's application indicates administrative costs within standard percentages, maximizing funds reaching communities. The A3 Team structure emphasizes efficiency through existing KDPH capacity rather than creating new bureaucratic infrastructure.

## Stakeholder Architecture

### Lead Agency Accountability

KDPH bears primary responsibility to CMS for:

**Program management**: A3 Team coordination, partner oversight
**Fiscal accountability**: Fund distribution, audit compliance
**Performance reporting**: Quarterly metrics, annual progress reports
**Stakeholder engagement**: Ongoing community input processes

### Key Partner Organizations

**Academic Medical Centers**:
University of Kentucky HealthCare: Statewide referral, specialty consultation, EmPATH replication, maternal-fetal medicine
University of Louisville Health: Regional support, training partnerships

**Provider Associations**:
Kentucky Primary Care Association: FQHC coordination, community health center network
Kentucky Hospital Association: Hospital engagement, trauma coordination
Kentucky Medical Association: Physician engagement, quality improvement
Kentucky Nurses Association: Nursing workforce, care team staffing

**Community Organizations**:
Kentucky Homeplace: CHW deployment, Appalachian community engagement
Community Action Agencies: Social services, nutrition programming
Regional Health Information Organizations: Data exchange, interoperability

**State Agencies**:
Department for Medicaid Services: Coverage coordination, payment policy
Department for Behavioral Health: CMHC oversight, crisis continuum
Kentucky Board of EMS: Protocol development, certification

### Payer Relationships

Kentucky's Medicaid managed care organizations have limited direct RHTP role but critical importance for sustainability. MCOs operate as:

**Downstream payers**: Reimbursing services provided through RHTP infrastructure
**Quality partners**: Aligning incentives with RHTP outcome targets
**Sustainability vehicles**: Sustaining capacity after RHTP funding ends

## What the Plan Assumes

Kentucky's RHTP strategy rests on assumptions that may or may not prove accurate:

**Technology can extend workforce at scale.** Telehealth, remote monitoring, and mobile services assume technological solutions adequately substitute for in-person provider presence. Rural broadband limitations may constrain telehealth adoption. Patient and provider technology acceptance varies. Technology extends access but may not fully replace in-person relationships critical for behavioral health, maternal care, and chronic disease management.

**Hub-and-spoke models create durable regional coordination.** The plan assumes hub infrastructure persists beyond RHTP funding through Medicaid reimbursement and local sustainability. Historical experience suggests grant-funded coordination structures often erode when external funding ends unless embedded in ongoing payment streams.

**Workforce pipelines produce retention, not just training.** Dental hygiene, EMS, and CHW training investments assume graduates remain in rural Kentucky. National experience shows mixed results for retention even with service commitments. Kentucky may train professionals who leave for better-compensated urban positions.

**Medicaid cuts do not overwhelm transformation gains.** The fundamental tension in Kentucky's plan: RHTP invests $1.06 billion over five years while Medicaid cuts extract an estimated $12.3 billion from rural Kentucky over the same period. RHTP cannot mathematically offset this extraction. The plan assumes transformation creates efficiency and access improvements despite net funding reduction.

**Partner organizations maintain capacity and commitment.** Implementation depends on academic medical centers, FQHCs, CMHCs, and community organizations sustaining engagement through the full program period. Leadership changes, competing priorities, and financial pressures may erode partner commitment before transformation is complete.

**State and local coordination functions effectively.** The A3 Team structure assumes effective coordination across CHFS agencies and external partners. Government coordination challenges are well-documented. Political transitions, including potential gubernatorial change, may disrupt implementation priorities.

## Conclusion

Kentucky proposes to invest approximately **$1.06 billion over five years** in a five-initiative transformation strategy emphasizing chronic care hubs, maternal health teams, behavioral health crisis response, dental access expansion, and EMS integration. The **Kentucky Department for Public Health** leads implementation through an A3 Team structure designed for accountability, rapid learning, and local flexibility.

**The initiatives interconnect strategically.** Chronic care hubs address the disease burden driving emergency utilization that EMS must transport. Maternal health teams reach women who might otherwise present to emergency departments for pregnancy complications. Behavioral health mobile response diverts crises from EDs and reduces law enforcement burden. Each initiative reinforces others while targeting distinct health priorities.

**The governance structure emphasizes existing infrastructure.** Rather than creating new entities, Kentucky leverages KDPH capacity, university partnerships, CMHC networks, and community organizations already embedded in rural communities. This approach enables faster implementation but depends on partner capacity to absorb expanded scope.

**Social care integration is embedded rather than isolated.** SDOH components appear throughout initiatives rather than as standalone programming. This integration may protect social care from budget triage but also makes social care survival dependent on initiative-level funding decisions.

**The plan acknowledges but cannot solve the Medicaid math.** Governor Beshear explicitly framed RHTP as helping "lessen the impacts of recent federal cuts" rather than claiming RHTP offsets cuts. The honest framing reflects political reality while avoiding false promises. Rural Kentucky will remain worse off despite RHTP investment if Medicaid cuts proceed as projected.

Part 3 of this analysis assesses what works, what struggles, and what gets cut when implementation constraints force triage. The analysis examines whether Kentucky's strategic bet can succeed given the Commonwealth's status as the state with the most rural hospitals at risk of closure nationally, and whether transformation investments can possibly outpace Medicaid erosion threatening the very health system RHTP seeks to transform.
