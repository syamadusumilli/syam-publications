# RHTP 3.NJ: New Jersey
## Rural Health Transformation Program State Profile

*Series 3: State Implementation*
*Rural Health Transformation Program Article Series*
*January 2026*

New Jersey received **$147,250,806** in RHTP funding for FY2026, the **lowest allocation of any state** in the nation. This position reflects not administrative failure but demographic reality: the most densely populated state in America has limited geographic rurality by any federal measure. Yet the funding figure creates a paradox. New Jersey's approximately **140,000 rural residents** receive roughly **$1,069 per capita annually**, one of the highest per-person allocations nationally, trailing only Rhode Island's extreme outlier status.

What emerges from New Jersey's RHTP approach is a pragmatic adaptation: recognizing that traditional rural health infrastructure categories simply do not apply, the state pursues **mobile health deployment, technology-driven solutions, and targeted support for medically underserved populations** whether they reside in federally designated rural areas or simply lack healthcare access.

## State Context

**The Density Problem**

New Jersey covers just **8,723 square miles** with a population of approximately 9.3 million, yielding a population density exceeding **1,200 people per square mile**. No other state approaches this concentration. For comparison, Wyoming's density is approximately 6 people per square mile. The entire state of New Jersey would fit comfortably within the boundaries of San Bernardino County, California.

This compression fundamentally shapes what "rural" means in New Jersey. The **Census Bureau's nonmetro designation** captures only about 1.5% of the state population. Using the broader **state definition** (areas with population density below 500 people per square mile), approximately 10% of residents live in rural communities. Either calculation produces a rural population smaller than the total enrollment at a large state university.

The **seven counties meeting state rural criteria** span two distinct regions: the northwestern tier (**Sussex, Warren, and Hunterdon** counties) along the Pennsylvania and New York borders, and the southern agricultural zone (**Salem, Cumberland, Cape May, and Atlantic** counties) in the Delaware Bay and Pine Barrens regions.

**Northwestern Rural: The Hills**

Warren County ranks as New Jersey's most rural at **90.2% rural land area**, followed by Salem (91.7% by some measures), Sussex (86.9%), and Hunterdon (86.2%). These northwestern counties share characteristics with rural Pennsylvania: rolling agricultural landscapes, small towns anchoring regional commerce, and **commuter populations** accessing metropolitan employment via Interstate 78 and Interstate 80 corridors.

Health infrastructure in the northwest relies on regional hospitals in urban centers. Hunterdon Medical Center in Flemington, Newton Medical Center in Sussex County, and facilities in Warren County serve populations that, while living in rural settings, are **rarely more than 45 minutes from hospital services**. This accessibility context differs fundamentally from the isolation defining rural healthcare in most states.

**Southern Rural: The Pinelands and Shore**

The southern rural counties present different challenges. The **New Jersey Pinelands** (Pine Barrens) encompass over 1 million acres of protected forest in Atlantic, Burlington, Ocean, and Cape May counties, one of the largest remaining wilderness areas in the Mid-Atlantic region. The Kirkwood-Cohansey aquifer beneath the Pinelands supplies drinking water for the region, creating development restrictions that preserve rural character.

**Cumberland County** ranks among New Jersey's most economically distressed, with poverty rates significantly exceeding state averages. The agricultural sector, particularly blueberry and cranberry production, employs **migrant and seasonal farmworkers** who face specific healthcare access challenges. Salem County, the least populous county in New Jersey with approximately 66,000 residents, has experienced population decline while struggling to maintain basic services.

**Atlantic County** hosts the unique intersection of the **Atlantic City casino economy** with surrounding rural communities. AtlantiCare Regional Medical Center, the dominant health system in southern New Jersey, operates from both an Atlantic City campus (steps from the Boardwalk) and a mainland campus in Pomona. This geography places rural residents within reach of sophisticated medical care while surrounding communities lack local primary care access.

**No Traditional Rural Health Infrastructure**

New Jersey's rural health landscape contains **zero Critical Access Hospitals, zero Rural Emergency Hospitals, and zero Rural Health Clinics** certified under federal rural definitions. This absence is structural rather than indicating robust access. Federal rural facility designations require geographic isolation thresholds that New Jersey's compact geography cannot meet.

What New Jersey does have: **12 Federally Qualified Health Centers** with multiple sites across the state, including organizations specifically serving rural and agricultural worker populations. The FQHC network provides the primary safety net infrastructure.

| FQHC Organization | Rural Coverage Area |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| CompleteCare Health Network | Cumberland, Salem, Gloucester counties |
| Southern Jersey Family Medical Centers | Atlantic, Cape May, Cumberland, Salem |
| Zufall Health Center | Warren, Morris counties |
| AtlantiCare Health Services FQHC | Atlantic County |

The **Southern Jersey Family Medical Centers** explicitly trace their origin to serving migrant and seasonal agricultural workers, maintaining outreach programs that visit **over 150 farm labor camps** during the growing season. This agricultural worker health infrastructure represents a distinctive element of New Jersey's rural health system absent in many states with larger rural populations.

**Medicaid Context and Fiscal Pressure**

New Jersey **expanded Medicaid** under the Affordable Care Act, with NJ FamilyCare covering approximately 2 million residents. The state maintains relatively comprehensive benefits including the **Section 1115 waiver** for health-related social needs, positioning New Jersey among the 16 states with approved or pending authority for nutrition interventions like medically tailored meals and produce prescriptions.

The **One Big Beautiful Bill Act** creates severe fiscal pressure for New Jersey. The state Department of Human Services estimates **$3.3 billion in cuts** to hospitals and public health funding, plus at least **$360 million in cuts** to the state budget through reduced federal matching. Additionally, an estimated **375,000 New Jersey residents** could lose Medicaid coverage, with 454,000 facing increased costs through the state marketplace.

New Jersey's RHTP application explicitly acknowledged the **non-backfill restriction**, noting that RHTP funds cannot replace lost Medicaid revenue. This constraint shapes the state's strategic approach: transformation investment cannot address the structural fiscal crisis but can position rural healthcare delivery for a more challenging financial environment.

## RHTP Application and Award

**Joint Agency Leadership**

New Jersey designated **joint leadership** between the Department of Health (NJDOH) and Department of Human Services (NJDHS) for RHTP implementation. Acting Health Commissioner **Jeffrey A. Brown** and Human Services Commissioner **Sarah Adelman** jointly coordinate the application and implementation process.

| Agency | Role |
|--------|------|
| New Jersey Department of Health (NJDOH) | Lead agency, application coordination |
| New Jersey Department of Human Services (NJDHS) | Medicaid alignment, waiver integration |
| Office of Primary Care and Rural Health | Technical assistance, rural definition |
| State Rural Health Advisory Committee | Stakeholder engagement |

The **Office of Primary Care and Rural Health** within NJDOH provides ongoing technical support, including maintaining the state's RHTP vendor resource directory for organizations seeking to participate in transformation activities.

**Stakeholder Engagement Process**

New Jersey conducted stakeholder outreach through multiple channels including:

- Online survey with **October 7, 2025 deadline** for input
- Virtual listening session on **October 3, 2025**
- Targeted outreach to healthcare providers, community organizations, and health sector partners
- Rural Health Symposium network engagement through NJPCA

The application emphasized that stakeholder input would inform priorities, identify gaps, and surface potential collaborators, though the request for input explicitly noted it was not a funding application and did not guarantee participation in subaward distribution.

**Technical Score and Award Positioning**

New Jersey received approximately **$47 million above the $100 million equal distribution baseline**, indicating modest technical score performance. The state's fundamental challenge is structural: RHTP formula factors that weight geographic rurality, rural health facilities, and rural population proportions systematically disadvantage the nation's most urbanized state.

Factors working against New Jersey's technical score:

- **No Critical Access Hospitals or Rural Health Clinics** to boost facility counts
- **Minimal geographic rurality** under federal definitions
- **Small absolute rural population** despite high overall state population
- **Limited hospital closure history** in designated rural areas

CMS Administrator **Mehmet Oz** visited New Jersey in November 2025, touring AtlantiCare facilities in Atlantic City and discussing rural health transformation with system leaders. The visit included a stop at AtlantiCare's FQHC and conversations about regulatory flexibility, technology adoption, and workforce development.

## Program Allocation and Initiatives

**Strategic Framework**

New Jersey's RHTP application emphasized four strategic areas aligned with the state's unique rural health context:

| Strategic Focus | Approach |
|-----------------|----------|
| Mobile Health Units | Bringing services to dispersed populations lacking local facilities |
| Treat-in-Place Strategies | Avoiding unnecessary transport by delivering care at patient locations |
| Technology Integration | Telehealth, remote monitoring, consumer-facing chronic disease management |
| Workforce Support | Training, recruitment, and retention for rural and underserved area providers |

The **mobile health unit emphasis** represents New Jersey's acknowledgment that building traditional rural health infrastructure makes limited sense in a state where proximity to urban facilities means transportation rather than construction addresses access barriers.

**Target Populations**

New Jersey defined target eligibility through multiple rural classification frameworks:

- **Federal designation**: Counties and census tracts meeting Census Bureau rural criteria
- **State designation**: Seven counties with population density below 500 per square mile
- **Road Ruggedness Scale (RRS)**: 10 rural census tracts across Bergen, Hudson, Morris, and Passaic counties identified through USDA methodology

The RRS inclusion is notable: it captures **pockets of rural isolation within metropolitan counties** that traditional definitions miss. These areas may be geographically close to urban centers but face access barriers due to terrain, transportation infrastructure, or socioeconomic factors.

NJDOH anticipates distributing funds among eligible applicants proposing activities benefiting **uninsured and underinsured residents** within designated rural target areas.

**Subaward Structure**

New Jersey released a Request for Applications organizing subawards into distinct activity categories:

| Activity | Focus |
|----------|-------|
| Activity A | Prevention and chronic disease management |
| Activity B | Provider payments for specified health services |
| Activity C | Consumer-facing technology for chronic disease |
| Activity D | Additional approved uses |

Separate project and budget submission forms required for each activity category. The first annual project period runs **February 1, 2026 through October 30, 2026**, with a designated Project Director required to lead coordination and implementation.

The state created a **Vendor Resource Directory** listing approved vendors for various RHTP activities, providing potential subawardees with a catalog of partners for technology, services, and program implementation.

## Implementation Context

**AtlantiCare as Regional Anchor**

**AtlantiCare** serves as the dominant health system in southern New Jersey, operating over 110 sites serving more than 1 million residents. The system's structure illuminates New Jersey's rural health dynamic:

- **Atlantic City Campus**: Located blocks from the Boardwalk, serving urban population with specialized services including trauma center and cardiac surgery
- **Mainland Campus**: Opened 1975 in Pomona, near major transportation arteries, serving surrounding rural and suburban communities
- **FQHC Network**: Comprehensive primary care, behavioral health, pediatric, and dental services through federally qualified health center designation

AtlantiCare's partnership with **Oracle Health** for digital transformation positions the system among early adopters of clinical digital assistants and voice-enabled medical record technology. The system's affiliation with **Cleveland Clinic Cancer Institute** brings national cancer care protocols to the region.

The planned **medical school partnership** between AtlantiCare, Stockton University, and Drexel University could address workforce pipeline challenges, though the program remains in development stages.

**Agricultural Worker Health Infrastructure**

New Jersey's **migrant and seasonal agricultural worker** population creates specific healthcare delivery challenges addressed through specialized FQHC programs:

**Southern Jersey Family Medical Centers** operates the largest agricultural worker health program in the state, with Migrant Health Promoters visiting farm labor camps from April through October. Services include on-site health screenings, healthcare navigation, and linkages to clinical services.

**Zufall Health Center** provides similar services for agricultural workers in Morris and Warren counties, including diabetes risk assessments, cancer screening education, and primary care linkages.

The **New Jersey Cancer Education and Early Detection (NJCEED) Program** provides outreach to agricultural workers for breast, cervical, colorectal, and prostate cancer screening.

**Social Care Integration**

New Jersey's **1115 waiver authority** for health-related social needs positions the state for RHTP initiatives incorporating social determinants of health. The approved nutrition intervention coverage enables:

- Medically tailored meals for qualifying conditions
- Produce prescriptions and nutrition education
- Integration with existing Medicaid managed care delivery

Whether RHTP subawards will specifically fund social care integration or rely on existing Medicaid authority remains to be determined as implementation proceeds.

## Sustainability Considerations

**The 2030 Question**

New Jersey's sustainability calculation differs from states where RHTP represents a lifeline for failing rural hospitals. With no CAHs or REHs to sustain, the question becomes whether **mobile health, telehealth, and workforce investments** create durable capacity that persists beyond 2030.

Mobile health units, once purchased and deployed, represent **capital assets** that remain operational regardless of RHTP continuation. Telehealth infrastructure similarly creates one-time investment with ongoing operational capacity. The critical sustainability question concerns **workforce**: will recruitment incentives and training programs produce providers who remain in rural practice, or will workforce support require perpetual funding?

**What Survives Partial Funding**

If RHTP funding faces reduction before 2030:

**Likely Preserved**
- Mobile health units (capital investment already made)
- Telehealth equipment and connectivity (infrastructure established)
- FQHC service expansions (sustained through Section 330 federal funding)

**Vulnerable**
- Workforce recruitment incentives
- Technical assistance and training programs
- Social determinants coordination activities

**At Risk**
- New program launches not yet operational
- Technology platform maintenance
- Ongoing operational support for mobile services

**Medicaid Cut Interaction**

The **$3.3 billion in projected cuts** to New Jersey's healthcare funding creates an environment where RHTP investments, however well-designed, cannot address the fundamental fiscal contraction. Rural FQHCs serving high Medicaid populations face particular risk: transformation funding may improve capabilities while underlying revenue erodes.

New Jersey's approach implicitly bets that **efficiency gains and service innovations** funded by RHTP can partially offset Medicaid revenue losses. This theory requires transformation activities to actually reduce costs or increase revenue through improved outcomes, not merely expand services without financial sustainability.

## Analysis and Assessment

**Strengths**

New Jersey's RHTP approach demonstrates **realistic adaptation** to structural constraints. Rather than pretending to have rural health infrastructure it lacks, the state focuses on mobile delivery and technology solutions appropriate to its geographic context.

The **joint NJDOH-NJDHS leadership** enables coordination between health transformation and Medicaid program administration. The existing **1115 waiver authority** provides frameworks for social determinants integration that other states must build from scratch.

The **FQHC network** represents established rural healthcare delivery infrastructure with operational experience serving dispersed and underserved populations. Building on this foundation rather than creating parallel systems increases implementation efficiency.

**Limitations**

New Jersey's **$147 million allocation** represents the national minimum, constraining ambitions regardless of strategic clarity. The state cannot pursue infrastructure investments available to states receiving $200+ million annually.

The **absence of traditional rural health facilities** means New Jersey's experience offers limited lessons for states where CAH viability and rural hospital closure prevention dominate transformation agendas. What works for mobile health delivery in a compact state with proximate urban resources does not translate to managing hospital systems across vast geographies.

**Formula Inequity**

New Jersey's positioning illuminates **RHTP formula limitations**. The nation's most densely populated state receiving the minimum allocation follows directly from weighting factors that prioritize geographic rurality over concentrated need. Whether this represents appropriate policy depends on how one defines "rural health transformation."

A resident of Cumberland County, New Jersey, facing **poverty, limited transportation, and inadequate local healthcare access** may have needs as acute as a resident of rural Mississippi. The federal formula does not recognize this equivalence. New Jersey's approach attempts to serve these populations within allocation constraints that treat geographic isolation as the primary marker of rural health need.

**The Equity Question**

New Jersey's urban health disparities in cities like Newark, Camden, Trenton, and Paterson exceed rural health challenges by most measures. RHTP funding designated for rural areas cannot address these concentrated urban needs, even when urban populations face healthcare access barriers exceeding those in designated rural communities.

Within rural areas, the **migrant agricultural worker population** faces distinctive vulnerabilities. Whether RHTP subawards adequately reach this population depends on implementation choices not yet finalized.

## Conclusion

New Jersey's RHTP implementation represents **pragmatic minimalism**: the state received the lowest allocation nationally, possesses no traditional rural health infrastructure, and pursues modest but practical strategies appropriate to its unique context.

The **mobile health and technology focus** makes sense for a state where transportation to existing facilities, rather than facility construction, addresses most access barriers. The **FQHC network** provides established implementation capacity. The **agricultural worker health infrastructure** addresses a rural population with specific needs often overlooked in transformation planning.

What New Jersey cannot do is offer a model for states facing genuine rural health system collapse. The state's challenges, while real, operate at different scale and intensity than the crises demanding attention in Mississippi, Kentucky, or West Virginia. New Jersey's RHTP experience will demonstrate what transformation looks like in a wealthy, densely populated state with modest rural areas. Whether those lessons transfer to contexts where rural health transformation means preventing the disappearance of healthcare entirely remains an open question.

The **$1,069 per rural resident** calculation provides perspective: New Jersey's small rural population receives substantial per-capita investment despite the minimal total allocation. Whether this concentrated investment produces measurable transformation depends on execution choices in the months ahead.
