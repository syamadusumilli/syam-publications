# RHTP 3.MA: Massachusetts
## Rural Health in an Urban State

Massachusetts received **$162 million in FY2026 RHTP funding**, ranking 46th among 50 states despite requesting $1 billion over five years. The gap between request and award reflects a fundamental tension in RHTP's funding formula: **Census Bureau definitions classify only 1.5% of Massachusetts residents as rural** (105,972 people), while the state's own methodology identifies 160 of 351 municipalities as rural, representing **700,000 residents across 57% of the Commonwealth's land mass**.

This definitional mismatch shapes everything about Massachusetts' RHTP implementation. The state brings **sophisticated healthcare infrastructure and strong Medicaid innovation capacity** to rural transformation work, but operates under severe funding constraints relative to its ambitions. Seven initiatives spanning workforce, telehealth, EMS integration, facility modernization, and care model innovation must compete for resources that amount to roughly **$231 per state-defined rural resident** annually, or **$1,529 per Census-defined rural resident**, depending on which population count applies.

The question Massachusetts must answer: Can innovation-focused transformation succeed where infrastructure rescue is unnecessary but access redesign remains essential?

## The Rural Landscape

Massachusetts defines rurality using a two-tier system developed by the State Office of Rural Health in 2002 and updated with each census. **Rural Level 1** designates "somewhat isolated" communities; **Rural Level 2** identifies "most isolated" areas. The state clusters rural communities into geographic regions: Berkshires (Northern and Southern), Franklin County regions (East and West Franklin, North Quabbin), Pioneer Valley (Quaboag Valley, North Central), Central Massachusetts, and the Cape and Islands (Outer Cape, Dukes, Nantucket).

**Healthcare Infrastructure Inventory**

| Facility Type | Count | Key Locations |
|---------------|-------|---------------|
| Critical Access Hospitals | 4 | Fairview Hospital (Great Barrington), North Adams Regional, Athol Hospital, Nantucket Cottage Hospital |
| PPS Rural Hospitals | 2 | Heywood Hospital (Gardner), Cooley Dickinson (Northampton area) |
| Rural Health Clinics | 7 | Scattered across western MA and Cape |
| Rural FQHC Sites | 14 | Of 143 statewide FQHC sites |
| Rural Skilled Nursing Facilities | 30 | Of 342 statewide |
| Rural Community Behavioral Health Centers | 3 | Of 29 statewide |
| Rural Opioid Treatment Centers | 5 | Of 66 statewide |
| Rural Pharmacies | 25 | Serving 160 rural communities |

**Fairview Hospital in Great Barrington** earned recognition as a Top 20 Critical Access Hospital nationally per Chartis. **North Adams Regional Hospital** reopened as a CAH in spring 2024 after Berkshire Health Systems converted the facility following its 2014 closure as a PPS hospital, a rare example of rural hospital restoration rather than permanent loss.

The state lost five rural hospitals between 2014 and 2025, declining from 11 to 6 facilities. Three completely closed; others converted to stand-alone emergency departments or merged into larger systems. **Franklin County has only five pharmacies** serving 26 municipalities across 725 square miles, the most rural county in Massachusetts.

**Workforce Shortages**

Primary care provider ratios reveal the access gap: **79 PCPs per 100,000 population in Rural Level 2 areas** versus 102 per 100,000 in non-rural communities. Nine of the state's 15 non-facility-based primary care Health Professional Shortage Areas are rural. The worst shortages appear in East and West Franklin (63 per 100,000), Southeast (56), Nantucket (41), and Dukes County (47), all well below the national ratio of 78.

Specialty care wait times extend to **one year in some rural regions** for gastroenterology and neurology appointments. The distance and time required for specialty access drives emergency department utilization for conditions manageable in outpatient settings.

## The Funding Reality

**Application Versus Award**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Requested (5-year) | $1,000,000,000 |
| FY2026 Award | $162,000,000 |
| Award as % of Request | 16.2% |
| National Rank (FY2026) | 46th of 50 |
| Per Rural Resident (Census) | $1,529 |
| Per Rural Resident (State Definition) | $231 |

Massachusetts' $162 million FY2026 award breaks down as **$100 million baseline funding** (distributed equally to all states) plus **$62 million workload funding** (allocated by CMS based on rural population size, facility conditions, and application scoring). The workload component reflects Massachusetts' small Census-defined rural population, producing one of the lowest workload allocations nationally.

**Comparison Context**

New Hampshire received $204 million with 483,000 rural residents. Vermont received $195 million with 388,000 rural residents. Maine received $190 million with 598,000 rural residents. Massachusetts' 700,000 state-defined rural residents generated $162 million. The formula rewards states where Census definitions capture actual rural populations; it penalizes states like Massachusetts where state and federal definitions diverge significantly.

## Program Allocation Table

Massachusetts' application allocated $1 billion across seven initiatives. With only $162 million awarded in FY2026 (16.2% of request), actual allocations will require significant prioritization. The table below shows **requested five-year budgets** from the state application, providing the framework for implementation even as annual funding remains uncertain.

| Initiative | Focus Area | 5-Year Request | Year 1 Request | Lead Organization | Key Deliverables |
|------------|------------|----------------|----------------|-------------------|------------------|
| I. Population Health Advancement | Chronic Disease Management, Value-Based Care | $291.7M | $53.0M | EOHHS | CDM Networks, Rural MA Connect platform, RISE data platform, Remote Patient Monitoring, Home Visiting Programs, Hospital at Home expansion |
| II. Innovation in Rural Care Models | Access Expansion | $114.5M | $24.3M | EOHHS/DPH | Mobile Health Units, Integrated Specialty Networks, Telehealth (pharmacy, dental, behavioral health), Rural Digital Health Sandbox, Maternal Health Continuum, OTP site expansion |
| III. THRIVE Workforce | Recruitment, Training, Retention | $123.1M | $23.8M | EOHHS/Healthcare Workforce Center | Rural Talent Campaign, Training Networks, NP Residencies, Housing Pathways, Field Placement Incentives, Recruitment/Retention Plans |
| IV. Healthy Rural Communities | Prevention, SDOH | $86.1M | $15.4M | DPH | Community-Based CD Prevention, CBO Network expansion, Local Public Health SSA coordination, Population-Specific Programs |
| V. EMS Service Integration | Mobile Integrated Health | $63.3M | $14.3M | Office of Emergency Medical Services | Community Paramedicine support, Pilot Reimbursement Program, Prehospital Protocol Mobile App |
| VI. Technology Interoperability | HIE, Cybersecurity | $83.2M | $16.1M | Mass HIway/MeHI | HIE Hub for rural providers, ACORN/CMED integration, LPH Electronic Record System, Cybersecurity implementation |
| VII. Facility Modernization | Capital Updates | $238.2M | $53.2M | EOHHS | Rural hospital renovations, Primary care site updates, Nursing facility modernization, BH/SUD specialized units |

**SDOH/HRSN/CHW Programs Flagged:**
- Initiative I: Community health workers integrated into Chronic Disease Management Networks
- Initiative IV: CBO network expansion includes SDOH coordination, population-specific interventions
- Initiative VI: Rural MA Connect platform enables clinical-social service-CBO referral coordination

## Social Care Integration

### SDOH/HRSN Initiatives

Massachusetts' application embeds social determinants work across multiple initiatives rather than isolating it as a standalone program. **Initiative IV (Healthy Rural Communities)** carries the primary SDOH mandate with $86.1 million requested over five years, but social care threads through workforce, technology, and population health activities.

The application explicitly requires **coordination of social services, community organizations, local public health, and clinical services** through integrated networks, technology platforms, and care navigation. Community-Based Chronic Disease Prevention Programs under Initiative IV will "leverage community-based partners to expand capacity for screening, education, and interventions addressing chronic disease and associated risk factors."

**HRSN Navigation**: The state proposes expanding Community Based Organization Networks to "organize local activities through trusted organizations and individuals to provide assessment, inform customized approaches, and establish local programming." These networks draw on Massachusetts' experience with COVID-19 community response, which operationalized over 1,000 rural community partners.

### Community Health Worker Programs

Massachusetts has **established CHW infrastructure predating RHTP** that the application intends to leverage and expand:

| Program Element | Status | RHTP Role |
|-----------------|--------|-----------|
| Board of Certification of CHWs | Active since 2014 | Credential pipeline for RHTP workforce |
| DPH Office of CHWs | Operational | Technical assistance, capacity building |
| MassHealth CHW Training Grants | Active through DSRIP | Model for RHTP training network expansion |
| Center for Health Impact Training | MassHealth ACO/CP eligible | Core competency training provider |
| Massachusetts League of CHC Initiatives | Active | CHW integration technical assistance |

The application notes that CDM Networks under Initiative I will "integrate community-based allied health positions (community health workers, community paramedics, care coordinators, public health nurses, community navigators) to support chronic-disease outreach, education, and self-management programs." This represents embedded deployment rather than standalone CHW programming.

**Massachusetts does not directly reimburse CHWs through MassHealth**, but CHWs participate in Medicaid service delivery through community health centers, group practices, and ACO/Community Partner arrangements. The capitated primary care program launched in 2023 incentivizes team-based care including CHW support.

### Community Information Exchange / Referral Platform

**Rural MA Connect** represents Massachusetts' proposed CIE platform under Initiative I, described as "a bi-directional technology platform that will connect clinical providers, social service organizations, and community-based-organizations throughout rural MA to unite clinical care, social support, and community resources."

Planned functionality includes:
- Real-time directories of community resources
- Closed-loop referrals
- EHR integration
- Care management systems
- Clinical workflows
- Billing supports

The application explicitly models Rural MA Connect on **Missouri's Transformation of Rural Community Health (ToRCH) program**, suggesting awareness of CIE implementation challenges in other states.

**Technology Vendor Landscape**: Massachusetts has not announced CIE platform vendor selection. The statewide market includes Unite Us and Findhelp deployments through various health systems and ACOs, but no unified rural platform exists. Mass HIway (the state HIE) and Massachusetts eHealth Institute (MeHI) will likely play coordinating roles in platform development and procurement.

### Social Care Integration Assessment Table

| Component | Proposed Funding | Integration Model | Survival Likelihood Under Partial Funding |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| CBO Network Expansion | Within $86.1M Initiative IV | Grants to regional networks | Moderate: Existing infrastructure reduces startup costs |
| CHW Integration | Embedded in Initiative I/IV | Distributed across CDM Networks | High: Leverages established certification and training systems |
| Rural MA Connect Platform | Within $291.7M Initiative I | State-coordinated procurement | Low-Moderate: Technology platforms require sustained investment; partial funding may produce pilot rather than statewide deployment |
| Local Public Health SSA Coordination | Within $86.1M Initiative IV | Intergovernmental agreements | High: SSAs already operational; RHTP adds rural health focus |
| Population-Specific Programs | Within $86.1M Initiative IV | Grants to community organizations | Moderate: Evidence-based models available but scale depends on funding |

## Potential Subawardees

Massachusetts has not published subaward determinations. Based on application content, stakeholder engagement (140+ organizations participated), and existing infrastructure, likely implementation partners include:

**Healthcare Delivery**
- Berkshire Health Systems (Fairview Hospital, North Adams Regional, Berkshire Medical Center)
- Community Health Center of Franklin County (Greenfield, Orange, Turners Falls sites)
- Heywood Healthcare
- Cooley Dickinson Health Care
- Cape Cod Healthcare
- Nantucket Cottage Hospital
- Rural Health Clinics across western MA

**Regional Planning and Public Health**
- Franklin Regional Council of Governments (Community Health division)
- Berkshire Regional Planning Commission (Public Health Alliance backbone)
- Pioneer Valley Planning Commission
- Local Public Health Shared Service Arrangements

**Workforce Development**
- Massachusetts League of Community Health Centers
- Center for Health Impact (CHW training)
- Area Health Education Centers
- Massachusetts Association of Community Health Workers
- Commonwealth Corporation

**Technology and Innovation**
- Massachusetts eHealth Institute (MeHI)
- Mass HIway (state HIE)
- MassCyberCenter
- Betsy Lehman Center for Patient Safety (Automated Adverse Event Monitoring)

**Community-Based Organizations**
- Aging Services Access Points / Area Agencies on Aging
- Independent Living Centers
- Berkshire United Way
- ViM Berkshires (free clinic)
- Community Action agencies across rural regions

## The Medicaid Context

Massachusetts faces **severe Medicaid exposure** despite its healthcare sophistication:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Projected Annual Medicaid Cuts (One Big Beautiful Bill Act) | $3.5 billion |
| Projected Coverage Losses | ~300,000 residents |
| Current Uninsurance Rate | 2.56% |
| Projected Post-Cut Uninsurance Rate | ~5% (doubling) |
| Rural Public Insurance Rate (Level 2) | 47% vs. 38% non-rural |
| RHTP Annual Award | $162 million |
| RHTP as % of Medicaid Cuts | <5% |

The 47% public insurance rate in Rural Level 2 communities means **nearly half of Massachusetts' most isolated residents depend on coverage facing federal cuts**. RHTP cannot legally backfill Medicaid reductions, creating a structural mismatch between transformation funding and coverage erosion.

Community Health Center of Franklin County, serving 9,000 patients across three sites, reports **40%+ Medicaid dependence** for patient revenue. Similar patterns appear across rural FQHCs and primary care practices. The combination of Medicaid cuts and modest RHTP investment creates fiscal pressure that care model innovation cannot resolve.

## Implementation Assessment

### Strengths

**Existing Infrastructure**: Massachusetts brings established systems that reduce implementation startup costs:
- Operational CHW certification and training networks
- Active Medicaid ACO program with required SDOH screening
- State HIE (Mass HIway) with rural integration pathway
- Public Health Shared Service Arrangements covering rural regions
- Health Policy Commission ACO certification requiring community partnerships

**Stakeholder Alignment**: The application engaged 140+ stakeholder groups including rural hospitals, FQHCs, trade associations, municipalities, and community organizations. This breadth suggests implementation buy-in, though translating engagement into execution requires sustained coordination.

**Innovation Capacity**: MassHealth's Section 1115 waiver history demonstrates ability to design and implement complex Medicaid innovations. Flexible Services program (nutrition and housing supports), Community Partners model (behavioral health and LTSS care coordination), and ACO infrastructure provide templates for RHTP integration.

### Vulnerabilities

**Mobile Health Unit Assumptions**: The application proposes mobile health units despite documented challenges. Berkshire Health Systems CEO Darlene Rodowicz noted their prior mobile clinic "closed because it wasn't cost effective. When you get into some of the communities you might only see four or five people for the day." The state's telehealth emphasis may prove more realistic given this experience.

**Connectivity Gaps**: Franklin Regional Council of Governments Director of Community Health Phoebe Walker identified residents who "can't get to one of the county's five pharmacies or can't open their online medical accounts because they don't have cell service to confirm their identity." Telehealth strategies assume broadband and cellular coverage that remains unavailable in many hilltowns and islands.

**EMS Workforce Constraints**: Initiative V proposes community paramedicine expansion, but Northern Berkshire EMS general manager noted "understandable wariness, mainly related to workload, staffing shortages, and concerns about taking on new responsibilities without guaranteed support." The same workforce crisis affecting clinical facilities limits EMS capacity for expanded roles.

**Scope Versus Resources**: Seven initiatives spanning $1 billion in requests across $162 million in Year 1 funding requires dramatic prioritization. The application does not identify which initiatives face deferral or elimination under partial funding scenarios.

### What to Watch

**Broadband Deployment**: Massachusetts Last Mile broadband initiative has extended connectivity to most rural communities, but gaps persist in hilltowns and islands. Telehealth and remote monitoring strategies depend on closing these gaps.

**THRIVE Workforce Outcomes**: NP residency enrollment, training pipeline graduation rates, and five-year service commitment retention will indicate whether workforce investments produce lasting rural capacity.

**Community Health Center Financial Stability**: Franklin County FQHC and similar rural primary care sites face dual pressure from Medicaid cuts and limited RHTP direct support. Their viability serves as a leading indicator for rural access preservation.

**Mobile Health Unit Utilization**: If implemented, mobile unit cost-per-encounter and avoided ED visit rates will test whether state planners learned from prior Berkshire experience.

**North Adams Regional Hospital Trajectory**: The recently converted CAH represents a test case for rural hospital sustainability models that other states may seek to replicate.

## Sustainability Considerations

Massachusetts differs from states pursuing hospital rescue. The sustainability question is not whether facilities survive to 2030, but whether **care model innovations achieve sufficient scale to justify continued investment** after RHTP ends.

**Housing Pathways** for clinical staff represent potentially the most durable investment. Rural tourism areas face housing cost inflation that prevents year-round healthcare worker retention regardless of salary. If THRIVE initiative produces functional housing support models, those mechanisms could persist beyond federal funding.

**CHW Integration** builds on established state infrastructure with existing certification, training, and ACO deployment pathways. This represents lower implementation risk and higher sustainability probability than new platform development.

**Technology Platforms** present the greatest sustainability challenge. Rural MA Connect requires development investment, vendor selection, provider onboarding, and ongoing maintenance. Partial funding scenarios may produce pilots rather than statewide deployment, limiting network effects and long-term viability.

The state's Key Performance Objective targets include securing **$5 million annually in new, non-federal, sustainable funding** for rural health infrastructure by 2030. Whether Massachusetts can develop alternative revenue streams while managing Medicaid transition determines post-RHTP system stability.

## Conclusion

Massachusetts occupies a unique position in the RHTP landscape: **strong state capacity, small Census-defined rural population, limited federal allocation, and severe Medicaid exposure**. The state received among the lowest awards nationally while facing among the largest absolute Medicaid cuts.

The seven-initiative framework demonstrates ambition appropriate to a billion-dollar request but challenging to execute with $162 million annually. Success likely requires strategic concentration on initiatives with existing infrastructure (workforce training, CHW integration, HIE expansion) rather than attempting parallel deployment across all proposed activities.

Secretary Mahaniah's vision of "radical and fundamental change in the health care delivery system in rural areas" faces a fundamental math problem: transformation-scale ambitions with pilot-scale resources. Massachusetts' experience will answer whether **innovation-focused transformation strategies can succeed where infrastructure rescue is unnecessary but access redesign remains essential**.

The state brings healthcare sophistication, Medicaid innovation capacity, and stakeholder coordination capabilities that other rural communities lack. Whether that sophistication translates across distance and digital divide determines RHTP Massachusetts' legacy.
