# RHTP 3.TN.3: Tennessee, The Analysis

## When Locally-Led Transformation Meets Structural Constraints

*Series 3: State Implementation*

## Introduction

Part 2 documented Tennessee's seventeen-initiative strategy organized around five strategic goals: rural healthcare transformation, maternal and child health, prevention and wellness, technology infrastructure, and workforce development. The plan channels approximately $207 million through Healthcare Resiliency Program grants, County Health Council awards, technology procurement, and workforce investments. Tennessee positioned itself as a potential national model for **locally-led rural health transformation**.

This analysis evaluates what actually works, what struggles against implementation headwinds, and what gets cut when plans meet reality. The framework applies pragmatic realism: acknowledging what RHTP can achieve in Tennessee while refusing to pretend $86 per capita transforms healthcare for 2.4 million people in a state that has refused Medicaid expansion and faces the highest rural hospital closure rate in the nation.

**Central question**: Can locally-led transformation through County Health Councils and competitive grants produce meaningful health improvement for rural Tennesseans, or do structural constraints (coverage gaps, Medicaid cuts, the Ballad Health monopoly, workforce shortages) doom Tennessee to administered activity without transformed outcomes?

The evidence suggests certain initiatives will succeed on their own terms, others will struggle against barriers Tennessee cannot control, and social care integration will survive as infrastructure investment rather than comprehensive service delivery. The coverage gap remains the constraint that RHTP cannot address, limiting transformation to populations with insurance while leaving 250,000 to 300,000 Tennesseans beyond reach.

## What Works

### Tennessee Community Compass Expansion

**Assessment: Strong Survival Probability**

Tennessee's closed-loop referral platform represents the initiative most likely to achieve lasting impact. **Tennessee Community Compass**, powered by Findhelp, already operates statewide with established vendor relationships, MCO integration, and provider participation. RHTP investment scales existing infrastructure rather than building from scratch.

**Why it works**:

The technology platform is **already operational and tested**. Since 2015, Findhelp has served Tennessee customers including TennCare's three Managed Care Organizations. The platform has demonstrated functionality, provider familiarity, and CBO engagement. RHTP funding extends reach rather than proving concept.

**Multi-agency integration creates stickiness.** With RHTP supporting integration across four additional state agencies, Tennessee Community Compass becomes embedded in government operations beyond healthcare. Platforms integrated into multiple agency workflows become standard practice that persists beyond individual funding cycles.

**TennCare MCOs are already invested.** Amerigroup, BlueCare, and UnitedHealthcare use Findhelp-powered platforms for their TennCare populations. MCO participation ensures referral volume, CBO engagement, and ongoing platform investment independent of RHTP funding.

**Sustainability pathway**: Once integrated into MCO operations, state agency workflows, and provider EHRs, Tennessee Community Compass becomes infrastructure rather than program. Platform maintenance costs are modest compared to initial deployment. The referral system persists beyond 2030 even without continued federal funding because it serves operational needs across multiple stakeholders.

**Limitation**: Closed-loop referrals require CBOs with capacity to receive and fulfill referrals. Rural Tennessee's CBO landscape is thin. Screening identifies needs; fulfillment requires resources that may not exist in all communities. Tennessee Community Compass can route referrals to transportation programs, but transportation programs must exist to receive them.

### Technology Infrastructure With Existing Provider Capacity

**Assessment: Moderate to Strong Survival Probability**

Tennessee's health technology grants succeed where they solve discrete problems for providers with existing capacity. EHR interoperability upgrades, cybersecurity enhancements, and telehealth equipment produce durable infrastructure improvements.

**Why it works**:

Technology investments address **genuine constraints with technical solutions**. Rural hospitals operating outdated EHR systems cannot participate in coordinated care networks. Cybersecurity vulnerabilities create existential risks. Telehealth equipment enables virtual consultations that save patient travel. These are implementation challenges, not proof-of-concept experiments.

**Technical infrastructure, once built, persists.** EHR upgrades function until systems become obsolete. Interoperability achieved remains. Telehealth equipment serves patients for years after purchase. Unlike programs requiring ongoing staffing, technology investments create assets.

**The 80% interoperability target is achievable** among providers receiving grants. Self-selected grantees have organizational capacity to implement technology. Competitive processes filter for readiness.

**Risk Factor**: Technology investment cannot overcome organizational dysfunction. Hospitals without staff to use upgraded systems gain little. Interoperability with no partners to connect provides limited value. Technology is necessary but insufficient for transformation.

### Emergency Care Infrastructure in High-Functioning Counties

**Assessment: Moderate Survival Probability (Variable by Region)**

The 89-ambulance procurement and EMS training investments work where EMS systems have baseline capacity. Equipment and training produce durable capabilities. Ambulances serve communities for a decade. NRP-certified EMS personnel retain skills beyond the funding window.

**Why it works**:

**Equipment procurement is straightforward.** Ambulance purchase and deployment involves standard procurement rather than complex organizational change. Counties receive vehicles. Vehicles serve patients. The process is linear and measurable.

**Training produces permanent capability.** EMS personnel certified in Neonatal Resuscitation Program retain certification through continuing education. Initial investment creates capabilities that compound through refresher training.

**Community Paramedicine addresses genuine gap.** Counties with robust EMS systems can deploy community paramedics for chronic disease management, post-discharge follow-up, and preventive care. The model extends existing organizational capacity.

**Risk Factor**: The initiative's success varies dramatically across Tennessee's 95 counties. Some counties have capable EMS systems that will use equipment effectively. Others lack personnel to staff new ambulances or organizational infrastructure for Community Paramedicine programs. Statewide metrics may obscure county-level variation where equipment sits unused or paramedics lack supervision.

### Local Health Department Direct Services for Uninsured

**Assessment: Moderate Survival Probability**

Tennessee's network of 89 rural Local Health Departments provides direct service infrastructure for uninsured populations who cannot access care elsewhere. LHD service expansion reaches populations the coverage gap excludes from private healthcare.

**Why it works**:

**LHDs exist and function.** Unlike initiatives requiring new organizational development, LHD service expansion builds on existing infrastructure. Health departments have facilities, staff, and community presence. RHTP funding expands capacity within functioning systems.

**Uninsured populations have nowhere else to go.** Tennessee's coverage gap means 250,000+ residents cannot access care through commercial markets or Medicaid. LHDs provide services regardless of insurance status. Expanded LHD capacity serves populations RHTP cannot reach through hospital or clinic transformation.

**eConsult platform extends specialist access.** The eConsult model allows primary care providers in LHDs to consult specialists electronically. Specialists respond asynchronously. Patients receive specialty expertise without traveling or facing specialist access barriers.

**Risk Factor**: LHD capacity varies dramatically across Tennessee's counties. Well-resourced LHDs in counties with adequate public health infrastructure can expand services effectively. Under-resourced LHDs in distressed counties may lack personnel, facilities, or organizational capacity to absorb RHTP funding productively. 21 navigator positions across 89 counties means most counties receive no additional navigation staff.

## What Struggles

### County Health Council Implementation Capacity

**Assessment: Variable by County, Overall Weak to Moderate**

The **County Health Council CARE Grants** represent Tennessee's strategic centerpiece: locally-determined health improvement projects implemented through 95 local councils. The concept is sound. Locally-led initiatives address community-specific priorities. But implementation capacity varies so dramatically across counties that statewide success metrics will obscure fundamental variation.

**The challenge is capacity heterogeneity.** County Health Councils in well-resourced counties (suburban Nashville, Knoxville, Chattanooga areas) have staff, organizational infrastructure, and implementation experience. Councils in distressed rural counties may consist of volunteer members with minimal administrative support.

**CARE Grants require proposal development, implementation management, and reporting.** Counties lacking grant administration capacity cannot effectively use competitive funding. The most disadvantaged communities may lack councils capable of developing competitive proposals, directing resources toward better-resourced areas.

**Historical context matters.** County Health Councils were established in 2021 and have varying maturity. Some have conducted comprehensive community health assessments and developed implementation capacity. Others remain nascent organizations without track records.

**Why CARE Grants Struggle**:

- Capacity varies dramatically across 95 counties
- Competitive processes favor counties with grant-writing experience
- Most distressed counties often have weakest organizational infrastructure
- Volunteer-based councils may lack implementation capacity
- Five-year timeline may be insufficient for capacity building in weakest counties

**What Could Help**: Tiered support providing intensive technical assistance to low-capacity counties. Pre-development grants helping councils build proposal capacity. Non-competitive base funding ensuring all counties receive some investment regardless of proposal competitiveness. Tennessee's plan provides "tailored resources and trainings" but may underestimate the gap between highest and lowest capacity councils.

### Workforce Pipeline Timing

**Assessment: Weak to Moderate (Timing Misalignment)**

Tennessee proposes training **hundreds of additional healthcare professionals** through expanded residencies, scholarship programs, and early exposure initiatives. The pipeline produces providers after RHTP ends.

**The arithmetic**:

**Physician training takes eleven to fourteen years** from undergraduate enrollment through residency completion. Students entering pipeline in 2026 begin practice in 2037 at earliest. Rural psychiatry residencies established in 2026 produce psychiatrists in 2030-2034.

**Nursing and allied health programs take three to six years.** Students entering in 2026 complete training by 2029-2032. Some pipeline output falls within RHTP window, but the bulk emerges after 2030.

**Community Health Workers are the exception.** CHW certification takes three to twelve months. Tennessee's CHW acceleration can produce practicing workers within Year 1. The 20-organization accreditation target is achievable within program window.

**The sustainability question**: Who employs pipeline graduates after RHTP ends? Rural hospitals losing Medicaid revenue cannot absorb new providers. Academic programs funded to operate training sites may lack capacity to continue without federal support. The pipeline produces providers; employment remains uncertain.

**Risk Factor**: Tennessee's workforce challenges extend beyond provider supply. Compensation levels, practice conditions, and quality of life lag competitor states. New graduates may complete training in Tennessee and relocate to Atlanta, Charlotte, or other markets offering higher salaries. Pipeline investment does not guarantee rural Tennessee practice.

### Technology Deployment in Unconnected Areas

**Assessment: Weak (Infrastructure Gap)**

Tennessee's technology-heavy strategy assumes broadband connectivity that remains unavailable in significant portions of rural Tennessee. Approximately **20-30% of rural Tennessee households lack reliable broadband** meeting minimum federal standards.

**The broadband gap**:

Appalachian Tennessee, the Cumberland Plateau, and portions of West Tennessee Delta have connectivity rates substantially below state averages. These are precisely the communities with longest distances to care, fewest providers, and greatest transformation need.

**BEAD Program timeline misalignment**: Federal broadband funding flows over three to five years. Infrastructure construction follows award cycles. Rural Tennessee broadband deployment extends into 2028-2030 at earliest. RHTP technology initiatives deploy to existing connectivity, not future infrastructure.

**Telehealth, remote monitoring, and digital health tools require connectivity**. Households without broadband cannot participate in virtual care regardless of provider deployment. Technology investments that assume universal connectivity exclude populations lacking infrastructure.

**Workarounds have limits**: Satellite internet (Starlink) provides connectivity at costs many rural residents cannot afford ($120+ monthly). Cellular data caps constrain video telehealth use. Technology solutions designed for broadband environments function poorly over limited connectivity.

**Implementation reality**: Tennessee's technology initiatives reach perhaps 70-80% of rural population. The remaining 20-30% in unconnected areas wait for infrastructure buildout while RHTP timelines advance without them.

### Maternal Health Transformation Versus Regional Constraints

**Assessment: Moderate (Regional Variation)**

Tennessee's maternal health initiatives address genuine crisis. The state ranks **43rd nationally in women's and children's health**. Rural maternity care deserts have expanded. Maternal mortality rates remain unacceptably high.

**The challenge is structural**.

**Maternity care deserts exist because obstetric services are financially unsustainable at low volumes.** Rural hospitals that closed obstetric units did so because delivering 50-100 babies annually could not support the staffing, equipment, and liability costs required. RHTP cannot change this arithmetic.

**Healthcare Resiliency Program grants can upgrade facilities but cannot guarantee sustainable obstetric capacity.** A rural hospital receiving equipment grants still faces the workforce, volume, and reimbursement challenges that caused obstetric service closure in the first place.

**Value-based payment models (Patient-Centered Obstetric Medical Home) require volume.** With 10 OB practices targeted for the maternal VBP program, coverage will be limited. Most rural pregnant women will not receive care through VBP-participating providers.

**What Works Within Maternal Health**:

- **TIPQC participation** improves quality in existing birthing hospitals
- **Telehealth maternal consultation** extends specialist support to rural providers
- **CHANT care coordination** connects pregnant women to resources
- **Mobile pregnancy app** provides information access regardless of location

**What Struggles**:

- **Reopening closed obstetric units** requires workforce and financial sustainability that grants cannot create
- **100% maternity desert coverage** through HRP grants is achievable on paper but may mean minimal intervention rather than comprehensive care capacity

## What Gets Cut

### The Triage Decisions Implementation Will Force

Tennessee received approximately $207 million against a plan designed for larger investment. Implementation will require prioritization. The following initiatives face elevated vulnerability to cuts or scope reduction:

**Health Information Exchange Development**

The statewide HIE initiative depends on **legislative action** requiring provider participation. If legislation fails or delays, HIE development proceeds slowly through voluntary participation. The 90% interoperability target becomes 60% or lower. Without mandatory participation, HIE remains aspirational rather than operational.

**Likelihood of scope reduction**: **High**. HIE development is complex, politically challenging, and dependent on factors outside TDH control.

**Innovation Centers/CoE Partnerships**

Connecting innovation offices to rural providers requires sustained engagement between academic institutions and under-resourced rural facilities. With competing demands on limited funding, CoE partnerships may receive reduced investment or narrower geographic scope.

**Likelihood of scope reduction**: **Moderate to High**. Initiative lacks clear deliverables and competes with more concrete service delivery investments.

**Value-Based Payment Capacity Building**

VBP capacity building for rural hospitals requires technical assistance, quality improvement infrastructure, and reporting systems. With 10 OB practices targeted for maternal VBP, coverage remains limited. Expansion beyond initial targets depends on continued investment and TennCare willingness to sustain incentive programs.

**Likelihood of scope reduction**: **Moderate**. TennCare has independent interest in VBP expansion, providing partial sustainability pathway.

**Healthy Built Environment Grants**

PSE grants for nutrition security infrastructure and health-promoting environments compete with direct service delivery for limited funding. Trail construction, community gardens, and fitness facilities produce long-term benefits but face prioritization pressure against acute care needs.

**Likelihood of scope reduction**: **Moderate**. County Health Council CARE Grants may absorb some HBE functions, but dedicated HBE investment likely decreases.

## Social Care Survival Assessment

### The Partial Funding Question

Tennessee received approximately **$207 million** of an application designed for the maximum possible award. The state-specific partial funding ratio is unclear from available documentation, but Tennessee's per-capita position (lower third nationally) suggests the state received less than requested.

**Evidence suggests social care components are relatively preserved**:

- Tennessee Community Compass expansion appears fully funded with dedicated project staff
- CHW program acceleration targets remain at 20 organizations
- Transportation initiative (RNET) is included with specific deliverables
- Clinical Care Navigation Teams at LHDs proceed with 21 staff positions

### SDOH/HRSN Survival

**Assessment: Survives as Infrastructure, Partial Service Delivery**

SDOH screening requirements **survive** through Tennessee Community Compass integration. The platform embeds screening in MCO case management and provider EHRs. HRSN assessment will occur at scale.

Navigation infrastructure **survives with limitations**. The 21 LHD navigator positions provide capacity in subset of counties. CHANT care coordination for pregnant women continues. But statewide navigation capacity remains thin relative to identified needs.

**Funding adequacy**: The proposed SDOH scope is achievable with allocated funding because Tennessee leverages existing TennCare investments in Tennessee Community Compass. RHTP supplements rather than creates infrastructure.

### CHW Program Survival

**Assessment: Survives with Modified Targets**

CHW deployment targets (20 accredited organizations) **appear preserved** in funded plan. The accreditation pathway through TNCHWA provides structure for sustainable CHW employment.

**Training pipeline is funded**. Partnership with Tennessee Community Health Worker Association ensures standards development and certification infrastructure.

**Supervision and employer infrastructure**: The accreditation requirement ensures organizations employing CHWs have appropriate clinical supervision. This quality control mechanism improves CHW integration sustainability.

**Risk Factor**: The 20-organization target may be ambitious. Achieving accreditation requires organizational investment that not all providers will make. Actual CHW deployment may fall short of targets if organizations cannot meet accreditation standards.

### CIE Platform Survival

**Assessment: Strong Survival**

Tennessee Community Compass **survives and expands** because it operates independently of RHTP. TennCare has already invested in the Findhelp platform. MCOs use it for their populations. RHTP funding supplements existing investment rather than creating new infrastructure.

**Technology procurement is complete**. No procurement timeline risk exists because Findhelp is already the selected vendor with operational platform.

**Platform scope expansion proceeds** with four additional state agency integrations. The expanded scope enhances sustainability by embedding the platform across multiple government operations.

### Sustainability Beyond 2030

**Tennessee Community Compass**: **High sustainability**. MCO investment continues regardless of RHTP. State agency integration creates operational dependency. Platform becomes standard infrastructure.

**CHW Programs**: **Moderate sustainability**. TennCare exploring sustainable reimbursement pathways for CHW services. If Medicaid CHW reimbursement materializes, programs continue. If not, employer capacity to sustain CHW positions without external funding is uncertain.

**Navigation Teams**: **Low to Moderate sustainability**. LHD navigator positions depend on state funding decisions. Without RHTP or replacement federal funding, positions likely eliminated.

**Transportation Programs**: **Low sustainability**. RNET depends entirely on grant funding. No sustainable revenue model for rural medical transportation exists without ongoing subsidy.

**Risk of Stranded Infrastructure**: Limited. Tennessee's social care investments focus on scalable platforms (TNCC) and workforce development (CHW accreditation) rather than facilities or equipment that could become stranded.

## The 2030 Question

### What Survives When Federal Funding Ends

**Technology Infrastructure**: EHR upgrades, interoperability, telehealth equipment, and cybersecurity enhancements persist as capital investments. Platforms require maintenance but not proportional ongoing investment.

**Tennessee Community Compass**: Platform operations continue through TennCare and MCO investment. Expanded state agency integration creates constituencies maintaining platform support.

**Workforce Pipeline Output**: Providers trained during RHTP enter practice after 2030, producing ongoing returns on training investment. However, employment and retention in rural Tennessee remain uncertain.

**County Health Council Organizational Capacity**: Councils that develop implementation capacity during RHTP retain that capacity. Organizational development persists even without dedicated funding.

### What Requires Ongoing Federal Support

**Navigator Positions**: Direct service staff at LHDs require ongoing salary support. Without RHTP replacement, positions are eliminated.

**CHW Programs (potentially)**: If TennCare CHW reimbursement does not materialize, programs depend on grant funding that may not continue.

**Community Paramedicine**: Operating costs for Community Paramedicine programs require ongoing funding. Equipment lasts; programs require staffing.

**Competitive Grant Programs**: HRP, CARE Grants, and similar competitive mechanisms require funding cycles. Without federal or state replacement funding, competitive granting ceases.

### State Commitment Beyond 2030

Tennessee's RHTP application emphasizes **sustainability planning from inception**. The locally-led model creates ownership that may persist beyond federal funding. County Health Councils with successful programs may advocate for state funding continuation.

However, Tennessee has historically limited state investment in rural health beyond Medicaid. The state's continued refusal of Medicaid expansion suggests fiscal conservatism that may not support RHTP replacement funding from general revenues.

**Sustainability assessment**: Tennessee's strategy creates some self-sustaining infrastructure (technology platforms, trained workforce, organizational capacity) while leaving direct service programs dependent on continued external funding.

## The Medicaid Math

### How Medicaid Cuts Interact with RHTP Investment

Tennessee receives approximately **$207 million annually** in RHTP funding while facing projected Medicaid cuts beginning in 2029. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act's Medicaid provisions will reduce Tennessee Medicaid spending, creating downstream impacts on rural hospitals and providers.

**The timeline creates asymmetric pressure**:

- **2026-2028**: RHTP investment flows without Medicaid cuts. Transformation initiatives can progress.
- **2029-2030**: Medicaid cuts begin while RHTP continues. Transformation and erosion occur simultaneously.
- **2031+**: RHTP ends, Medicaid cuts continue. Transformation gains face erosion without federal support.

### Net Position of Rural Providers

Rural hospitals in Tennessee operate on thin margins. The Tennessee Hospital Association reports that **nearly half of Tennessee's hospitals operate at a loss**. RHTP prohibits using funds to backfill Medicaid revenue. Equipment grants and technology investments improve efficiency but cannot offset fundamental revenue losses.

**Net position analysis**:

- **RHTP provides**: Infrastructure upgrades, technology deployment, workforce training, grant programs
- **Medicaid cuts remove**: Direct reimbursement revenue, coverage for patients, financial stability

The net position depends on timing. RHTP investments made in 2026-2028 may strengthen facilities facing cuts in 2029+. But facilities that close before transformation investments mature receive no benefit.

### Whether Transformation Outpaces Erosion

**Tennessee faces mathematical reality**: RHTP cannot offset Medicaid cuts at scale. The $207 million annual investment cannot compensate for coverage losses affecting hundreds of thousands of Tennesseans and revenue reductions affecting every hospital in the state.

**Scenario analysis**:

**Optimistic**: RHTP investments mature before Medicaid cuts bite hardest. Technology efficiencies reduce costs. Workforce pipelines produce providers. Regional coordination creates economies of scale. Transformation gains partially offset erosion.

**Pessimistic**: Hospital closures accelerate faster than transformation investments mature. Coverage losses prevent patients from accessing transformed services. Workforce continues migrating to urban and out-of-state practice. Erosion overwhelms transformation.

**Most likely**: Transformation proceeds successfully in subset of communities with adequate infrastructure, organizational capacity, and population stability. Other communities experience continued decline despite RHTP investment. Aggregate metrics show improvement while distribution remains highly unequal.

## Stated Priorities Versus Actual Priorities

### What the Application Says Matters

Tennessee's application emphasizes:

- **Locally-led transformation** through County Health Councils
- **Technology modernization** enabling virtual care and care coordination
- **Workforce development** addressing persistent shortages
- **Maternal and child health** as explicit priority
- **Prevention and wellness** aligned with MAHA priorities

### What Funding Allocations Reveal

Funding distribution tells a different story:

- **Rural Healthcare Transformation (Goal 1)** receives the largest allocation (33-36%), emphasizing infrastructure over wellness
- **Prevention and wellness (Goal 3)** receives substantial allocation (16-20%) but less than infrastructure
- **Workforce development** receives meaningful investment but cannot overcome decade-long pipeline timing
- **Maternal health** receives dedicated funding but cannot solve structural sustainability challenges

### Where Rhetoric Diverges from Resources

**Local leadership rhetoric versus centralized grant mechanisms**: Tennessee emphasizes locally-led transformation, but HRP competitive grants centralize funding decisions at TDH. Counties compete for state-controlled resources rather than receiving direct allocations.

**Wellness emphasis versus coverage constraints**: MAHA-aligned wellness programming receives funding, but 250,000+ uninsured Tennesseans cannot translate lifestyle education into clinical care. Prevention rhetoric cannot overcome coverage gaps.

**Technology transformation versus broadband reality**: Technology investments assume connectivity that remains unavailable in 20-30% of rural Tennessee. Technology rhetoric exceeds infrastructure reality.

### The Real Theory of Change

Tennessee bets that **locally-led, technology-enabled transformation can produce meaningful improvement despite Medicaid non-expansion**. The theory assumes:

1. County Health Councils have sufficient capacity to implement local priorities
2. Technology extends provider reach without requiring workforce expansion
3. Tennessee Community Compass connects clinical care to social services effectively
4. Competitive processes identify capable implementers
5. Workforce pipelines eventually produce providers (even if after 2030)

The theory's vulnerabilities center on capacity variation (County Health Councils), infrastructure gaps (broadband), and the fundamental coverage constraint that RHTP cannot address.

## Lessons for Other States

### What Tennessee's Approach Teaches

**Leverage existing infrastructure**: Tennessee's strategy succeeds where it builds on Tennessee Community Compass, County Health Councils, Healthcare Resiliency Program, and LHD networks. States with existing infrastructure can scale efficiently. States building from scratch face slower implementation.

**CIE platform selection matters**: Tennessee's decision to use Findhelp (established vendor with Tennessee history) rather than procuring new platform reduced implementation risk. States should evaluate existing platforms before procurement.

**Local capacity varies dramatically**: County Health Council variation reveals that locally-led models require capacity building in disadvantaged areas. States assuming uniform local capacity will see resources flow to already-advantaged communities.

### Transferable Elements

- **Competitive grant mechanisms (HRP model)** identifying capable implementers
- **CIE platform expansion** as sustainable social care infrastructure
- **CHW accreditation pathways** creating quality-controlled workforce expansion
- **eConsult platforms** extending specialist access without patient travel
- **Technology infrastructure grants** producing durable assets

### Context-Specific Elements

- **County Health Council infrastructure** specific to Tennessee governance
- **Tennessee Community Compass brand** and TennCare integration
- **Three grand division regional structure** (East, Middle, West Tennessee)
- **Ballad Health monopoly** unique to Northeast Tennessee

### What to Avoid

**Assuming local capacity exists uniformly**: Tennessee's 95 County Health Councils have dramatically varying capacity. Other states should assess local organizational capacity before designing locally-led programs.

**Technology-first strategies without broadband reality check**: Tennessee's technology investments will not reach unconnected populations. States should map broadband availability against technology deployment targets.

**Workforce pipeline investments without retention strategies**: Training providers does not ensure rural practice. States should pair pipeline investment with retention mechanisms addressing compensation, practice conditions, and quality of life.

**Proceeding without Medicaid expansion**: Tennessee's transformation faces fundamental constraints from the coverage gap. States that can expand Medicaid should do so before expecting RHTP to transform rural health.

## Conclusion

Tennessee presents a comprehensive strategy leveraging existing infrastructure through locally-led transformation. The plan succeeds where it builds on Tennessee Community Compass, scales Healthcare Resiliency Program grants, and deploys technology to willing and capable providers. These elements produce durable improvements that persist beyond 2030.

The plan struggles where it assumes uniform County Health Council capacity, deploys technology to unconnected areas, relies on workforce pipelines that produce providers after funding ends, and proceeds without addressing the fundamental coverage gap. These constraints limit transformation to populations already advantaged by organizational capacity, infrastructure, and insurance coverage.

**Overall assessment**: Tennessee will achieve **partial success**. Technology platforms will function. Tennessee Community Compass will scale. Some County Health Councils will implement effective programs. Maternal health metrics will improve in participating facilities. Workforce pipelines will eventually produce providers.

**But transformation gains will not offset erosion**. Medicaid cuts will remove revenue that RHTP cannot replace. Hospital closures will continue in communities lacking organizational capacity for transformation. The coverage gap will exclude hundreds of thousands of Tennesseans from transformed services. Regional variation will persist and potentially widen.

**Prospects for rural Tennesseans**: Residents in counties with strong County Health Councils, adequate broadband, and nearby functioning hospitals will see genuine improvement. Residents in distressed counties lacking organizational capacity, connectivity, and healthcare infrastructure will see continued decline despite RHTP investment. The gap between best-served and worst-served communities may widen rather than narrow.

**What must change for success**: Tennessee's transformation requires conditions outside RHTP's scope. Medicaid expansion would provide coverage for 250,000+ residents currently excluded from transformed healthcare. Broadband buildout would enable technology deployment in unconnected areas. Ballad Health accountability would improve quality in East Tennessee. These changes require political decisions Tennessee has thus far refused to make.

**Final judgment**: Tennessee's strategy is rational given constraints. The locally-led approach, technology focus, and existing infrastructure leverage represent reasonable optimization within impossible parameters. But reasonable optimization cannot overcome mathematical reality. $86 per capita cannot transform healthcare for 2.4 million people in a state that refuses Medicaid expansion and faces the highest hospital closure rate in the nation.

Tennessee's 2.4 million rural residents deserve better. RHTP provides what federal policy makes available. What federal policy provides is insufficient for the scale of need.
