# RHTP 3.GA.1: Georgia, The Problem

*Part 1 of 3: Establishing the baseline crisis, funding reality, and context shaping implementation*

## Introduction

On December 29, 2025, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced that Georgia would receive **$218.8 million** in the first year of the five year Rural Health Transformation Program. Governor Brian Kemp's administration branded the initiative **GREAT Health** (Georgia Rural Enhancement and Transformation of Health), positioning the award as one of the largest among the fifty states.

The headline figure obscures a more complex reality. Georgia contains **2.9 million rural residents**, the fifth largest rural population in the nation. The $218.8 million translates to approximately **$75 per rural Georgian** in the first year. Over the program's five year duration, assuming consistent funding, the state might receive roughly $1.1 billion total, or **$75.52 per rural resident annually**. Meanwhile, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act's Medicaid cuts are projected to reduce federal health care funding in Georgia by **$2.29 billion** over the coming decade, threatening to overwhelm any gains from transformation investment.

Georgia occupies a **unique position** among RHTP recipient states. It is one of only ten states that has not expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Instead, Governor Kemp implemented **Georgia Pathways to Coverage**, a partial expansion program requiring 80 hours of monthly work, education, or volunteer activity for eligibility. After 18 months of operation, Pathways has enrolled approximately **11,000 Georgians** out of an estimated 345,000 eligible individuals. The program that was supposed to provide an alternative to Medicaid expansion has instead demonstrated the limits of conditional coverage approaches.

The state's rural hospitals face compounding crises. **Nine hospitals in rural Georgia have closed since 2010**. Another **20 rural hospitals** are at risk of closure according to the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform, with 18 of those classified as Critical Access Hospitals operating in financial distress. The Black Belt counties stretching across southwest Georgia contain some of the highest persistent poverty rates in the nation, with child poverty exceeding 30% in multiple counties and life expectancy gaps of **six to eight years** compared to metropolitan Atlanta.

Georgia's RHTP challenge is not merely operational. It is fundamentally structural. The state must attempt transformation in a policy environment hostile to the mechanisms that make transformation possible. Can $75 per rural resident catalyze meaningful change when coverage remains inaccessible for hundreds of thousands, workforce shortages leave entire counties without physicians, and federal Medicaid cuts threaten the financial viability of the hospitals RHTP is designed to transform?

## The Baseline Crisis

### Infrastructure Inventory

Georgia's rural health infrastructure reflects decades of erosion punctuated by episodic collapse. The state contains **71 rural hospitals** according to the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform, serving a rural population spread across 120 of the state's 159 counties designated as rural by the Census Bureau.

**Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs)** form the backbone of Georgia's rural safety net. The state has **30 CAHs**, facilities limited to 25 beds that receive cost based Medicare reimbursement. This reimbursement methodology provides some financial protection, but CAH designation does not guarantee viability. **Eighteen of Georgia's CAHs** are currently at risk of closure according to Chartis analysis, operating with negative margins and depleting reserves.

**Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs)** provide primary care in underserved areas. Georgia hosts approximately **35 FQHCs** with multiple sites across rural counties. These centers serve as the primary care backbone in many communities where private practice has disappeared, but FQHCs cannot replace hospital services when emergencies occur or complex care is needed.

**Rural Health Clinics (RHCs)** number approximately **180 across the state**, receiving enhanced Medicare reimbursement for services in designated shortage areas. RHCs often operate as satellite facilities for larger health systems or as independent practices struggling for financial sustainability.

Hospital closures have already reshaped the care landscape. **Southwest Georgia Regional Medical Center** in Cuthbert closed in 2020, leaving Randolph County without a hospital. **Lower Oconee Community Hospital** in Glenwood, **Chestatee Regional Hospital** in Dahlonega, **Hutcheson Medical Center** in Fort Oglethorpe, and multiple other facilities have shuttered since 2010. Each closure creates a healthcare desert, forcing residents to travel further for emergency care and stripping communities of their largest employers.

The facilities at immediate closure risk include **Flint River Community Hospital** in Montezuma, **Irwin County Hospital** in Ocilla, **Fannin Regional Hospital** in Blue Ridge, and **Washington County Regional Medical Center** in Sandersville. Four hospitals specifically identified by University of North Carolina researchers as at risk under Medicaid cuts. Three of those four are in districts represented by members of Congress who voted for the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

### Workforce Crisis

Georgia faces a healthcare workforce crisis of extraordinary scope. The state is projected to need **8,000 additional physicians by 2030** just to maintain its current physician to patient ratio, which already trails the national average by 23%. The primary care shortage alone requires **2,100 additional physicians**.

**142 of Georgia's 159 counties** are designated as Health Professional Shortage Areas for primary care. This designation means the population to provider ratio exceeds 3,500 to 1. In some rural counties, the ratio approaches 5,000 to 1 or higher. **Nine Georgia counties have no physician at all**: Echols, Taliaferro, Treutlen, Webster, Glascock, Quitman, Schley, and Warren Counties exist as complete primary care deserts.

Specialty care shortages create cascading access problems. **82 Georgia counties have no OB/GYN**, forcing pregnant women to drive hours for prenatal care and delivery services. **90 counties have no psychiatrist**, leaving mental health needs unaddressed or requiring travel to distant providers. **65 counties have no pediatrician**. Rural Georgians with cancer, cardiac conditions, or neurological disorders must travel to regional centers in Augusta, Savannah, or Atlanta.

The workforce pipeline shows limited capacity to address these shortages. The Medical College of Georgia and Mercer School of Medicine produce physicians, but most graduates settle in metropolitan areas rather than rural practice. Governor Kemp has proposed a new medical school at the University of Georgia and a dental school campus in Savannah. These investments will take years to yield practicing clinicians, and historical patterns suggest most will still choose urban careers.

Nurse practitioners and physician assistants cannot fill the gap under Georgia law. The state does not grant nurse practitioners **full practice authority**, requiring physician supervision that is difficult to arrange when supervising physicians are unavailable. Of the 28 states that have granted full practice authority to expand primary care capacity, Georgia is not among them.

### Health Outcomes

Georgia's health outcomes reveal the consequences of infrastructure and workforce deficits. The state ranks among the bottom ten states for **overall health outcomes** according to multiple national assessments.

**Life expectancy** in rural Georgia trails metropolitan areas by significant margins. In some Black Belt counties, life expectancy is **six to eight years shorter** than in Fulton County (Atlanta). This gap represents not merely healthcare access but accumulated disadvantage: poverty, food insecurity, environmental exposure, and chronic disease prevalence combining to shorten lives.

**Diabetes prevalence** in rural Georgia exceeds 14% in many counties, compared to national averages around 11%. **Obesity rates** exceed 35% in numerous rural counties. **Heart disease mortality** in rural Georgia ranks among the highest in the nation, with cardiovascular death rates in south Georgia double those of metropolitan Atlanta.

**Maternal mortality** exposes the consequences of OB/GYN deserts. Georgia's maternal mortality rate ranks among the worst nationally, with Black women facing mortality rates **three to four times higher** than white women. Rural hospital closures have eliminated labor and delivery services in multiple counties, forcing high risk pregnancies to travel further for care. In September 2025, another rural Georgia hospital announced plans to close its labor and delivery unit, citing Medicaid cuts as a contributing factor.

**Infant mortality** in rural Georgia exceeds 10 deaths per 1,000 live births in some counties, more than double the national average. The highest rates cluster in the Black Belt, where persistent poverty intersects with healthcare access barriers.

**Mental health** outcomes reflect provider shortages and stigma. Suicide rates in rural Georgia exceed urban rates, yet mental health services remain inaccessible for most rural residents. The opioid epidemic reached rural Georgia later than Appalachian states but has established endemic presence, with overdose deaths rising and treatment capacity severely limited.

### Distance and Access

Geography compounds workforce shortages. **75% of Georgia's land area** is classified as rural, with population concentrated in the Atlanta metropolitan area and secondary cities. The drive from the southwest corner of the state to the nearest tertiary care center in Albany or Columbus can exceed an hour. For residents in isolated counties, reaching the Emory or Grady health systems in Atlanta requires drives of **two to three hours**.

Emergency response times reflect these distances. In counties without hospitals, ambulance crews face extended transport times that can prove fatal for heart attacks, strokes, and trauma. The "golden hour" for trauma care becomes theoretical rather than achievable when the nearest emergency department is 45 minutes away.

Three out of four Georgia counties qualify as **Health Transportation Shortage Areas**, communities with significant barriers to reaching healthcare services. These barriers include lack of public transportation, household poverty limiting vehicle access, and geographic isolation. More than a quarter of Georgia's population lives in these shortage areas, with an additional 16% in borderline shortage areas.

Telehealth offers partial solutions but cannot replace emergency services or procedures. Georgia's Department of Public Health has deployed telehealth capacity across all 159 counties, but broadband access remains limited in rural areas. Even where connectivity exists, virtual care cannot deliver babies, set fractures, or stabilize trauma patients.

## The Funding Reality

### RHTP Award

Georgia's **$218.8 million** first year RHTP award ranks among the larger allocations nationally in absolute terms. The state's application emphasized transformation of healthcare delivery systems, workforce development, and technology infrastructure.

The five year projection, assuming consistent annual awards, suggests Georgia could receive approximately **$1.09 billion** over the program's duration. This projection carries uncertainty given the program's annual rescoring mechanism and clawback provisions for states that fail to meet implementation commitments.

### Per Capita Analysis

The critical metric is not aggregate funding but **funding per rural resident**. Georgia's 2.9 million rural population dilutes the $218.8 million annual award to approximately **$75.45 per rural Georgian**.

This per capita funding places Georgia in the **bottom quartile** among RHTP recipient states. Compare Georgia's position:

| State | Rural Population | Estimated Annual Award | Per Rural Resident |
|-------|-----------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Wyoming | ~400,000 | ~$160M | ~$400 |
| South Dakota | 390,000 | ~$200M | ~$513 |
| Montana | ~550,000 | ~$165M | ~$300 |
| **Georgia** | **2,900,000** | **$218.8M** | **~$75** |
| Texas | 4,700,000 | $281M | ~$60 |
| North Carolina | 3,500,000 | ~$220M | ~$63 |

The RHTP funding formula creates a **scale penalty** for states with large rural populations. Georgia receives roughly one fifth the per capita funding of sparsely populated states like Wyoming or South Dakota. This structural disadvantage means Georgia must accomplish transformation with significantly fewer resources per person served.

### Facility Level Perspective

What does $218.8 million buy across Georgia's rural health infrastructure? The state has 71 rural hospitals, 30 Critical Access Hospitals, approximately 180 Rural Health Clinics, and 35 FQHCs with rural sites.

If divided equally among rural hospitals alone, the annual allocation would provide approximately **$3.1 million per facility**. This calculation is illustrative rather than actual, as RHTP rules prohibit direct hospital operational support. The funding must flow through state designed programs addressing workforce, technology, care coordination, and other transformation priorities.

For context, a single rural hospital's annual operating budget typically ranges from **$15 million to $50 million**. The average Critical Access Hospital requires approximately **$20 million annually** to maintain operations. RHTP funding, even if it could flow directly to facilities (which it cannot), would cover a fraction of operational needs.

The math clarifies RHTP's role: **catalyst, not rescue**. The funding can support pilot programs, seed innovations, and create connections. It cannot replace lost Medicaid revenue, hire the 8,000 physicians Georgia needs, or keep hospitals open that face structural insolvency.

### National Ranking

Among the fifty states, Georgia's per capita RHTP position falls in the bottom ten. States with smaller rural populations receive substantially more per resident, while states with comparable or smaller rural populations receive similar or greater total allocations.

The formula rewards rurality as a proportion of state population, not absolute rural population. Georgia's large metropolitan Atlanta area dilutes the state's rurality percentage, reducing formula benefits. The state's significant rural population becomes a liability rather than an asset in funding calculations.

## The Fiscal Context

### Medicaid and Non Expansion

Georgia's refusal to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act shapes every dimension of rural health. The state is one of **ten remaining non expansion states**, leaving an estimated **175,000 Georgians** in the coverage gap, too poor to qualify for ACA marketplace subsidies but ineligible for Medicaid under Georgia's restrictive rules.

Georgia's traditional Medicaid eligibility for non disabled, non pregnant adults requires caring for a minor child with household income below approximately **26% of the federal poverty level**. For a family of three, this means income cannot exceed roughly $551 monthly. Adults without dependent children have virtually no pathway to coverage regardless of income.

**Georgia Pathways to Coverage** represents the state's alternative to full expansion. Launched in July 2023 after years of legal challenges and implementation delays, Pathways offers Medicaid coverage to adults with income up to 100% of the federal poverty level who document 80 hours monthly of work, education, or volunteer activities.

The results have been dismal. The state estimated **345,000 Georgians** would be eligible and **100,000** would enroll in the first year. After 18 months, **only 11,000 people** have enrolled. More than 40% of Georgia counties have fewer than 10 Pathways enrollees despite having one of the highest uninsured rates in the nation.

The program's failure stems from design, not implementation glitches. Monthly work reporting requirements proved administratively burdensome for both the state and enrollees. The state quietly rolled back monthly verification to only initial enrollment and annual renewal, acknowledging the original design was unworkable. Even with modifications, enrollment remains a fraction of projections.

Federal taxpayers have spent more than **$86 million** on Pathways, three quarters of which has gone to consultants and administration rather than healthcare services. The per enrollee cost dramatically exceeds what full Medicaid expansion would require, while covering a tiny fraction of the eligible population.

Full Medicaid expansion would extend coverage to adults with income up to 138% of poverty (approximately $20,783 annually for an individual) without work requirements. An estimated **400,000 to 500,000 additional Georgians** would gain coverage. The federal government would cover 90% of costs for newly eligible enrollees, compared to the state's approximately 67% federal match for traditional Medicaid.

The coverage gap creates cascading financial effects. Uninsured patients receive care in emergency departments, generating uncompensated care that strains hospital finances. Hospitals serving high proportions of uninsured patients, predominantly in rural areas, face the greatest financial pressure. The hospitals most likely to close are those in communities with the highest uninsured rates, where Medicaid expansion would provide the most relief.

### Medicaid Cuts Under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law July 4, 2025, cuts approximately **$1.02 trillion from Medicaid** over ten years. For Georgia specifically, these cuts are projected to reduce federal health care funding by **$2.29 billion** through 2034.

The legislation implements cuts through multiple mechanisms phased over several years:

**January 2026**: The enhanced Federal Medical Assistance Percentage incentivizing Medicaid expansion sunsets. States that expanded Medicaid lose the 90% federal match for expansion population, dropping to their standard match rate.

**October 2026**: Medicaid eligibility narrows for certain non citizens. States must conduct eligibility redeterminations at least every six months, adding administrative burdens expected to disenroll people who remain eligible but cannot navigate paperwork requirements.

**January 2027**: Work requirements take effect nationally, requiring 80 hours monthly of employment, training, or volunteer activity for most Medicaid recipients. Georgia's Pathways experience demonstrates how work requirements reduce enrollment among eligible populations.

**October 2028**: States must implement cost sharing for certain Medicaid services.

The Congressional Budget Office estimates that **11.8 million Americans** will lose Medicaid coverage directly under these provisions, with an additional 3.1 million losing coverage under marketplace plans. In Georgia, an estimated **310,000 people** could lose health insurance by 2034 from Medicaid changes alone. If enhanced ACA premium tax credits expire as currently scheduled, the total Georgia coverage loss could reach **610,000 to 750,000 people**.

For rural hospitals, the math is devastating. Medicaid represents approximately **20% of hospital revenue** nationally, but for rural hospitals the figure often reaches **40% to 50%**. The Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform projects that Medicaid cuts place **20 Georgia rural hospitals** at risk of closure and **28 additional hospitals** at risk of service reductions.

### The RHTP/Medicaid Math

Georgia's fiscal position can be summarized simply: **$218.8 million annually in RHTP transformation funding** versus **$2.29 billion in projected Medicaid cuts** over the decade.

Even assuming RHTP funding remains stable over five years at approximately $1.09 billion total, the transformation investment represents less than **half of one decade's projected Medicaid cuts**. RHTP funding ends in 2030. Medicaid cuts continue indefinitely.

The RHTP cannot backfill Medicaid cuts by program design. The funding cannot be used for direct hospital operational support or to cover services for uninsured patients. It must flow through state designed transformation initiatives addressing workforce, technology, and care delivery innovation. These initiatives matter, but they operate in a fiscal environment where the foundations of rural hospital viability are simultaneously eroding.

Rural hospitals need coverage for their patients as much as they need transformation funding for innovation. Georgia is attempting transformation while denying coverage to hundreds of thousands of residents and preparing to absorb massive reductions in the coverage programs that do exist. RHTP becomes bandages applied to wounds that are simultaneously being torn open.

### Other Federal Program Interactions

RHTP operates alongside other federal programs affecting rural health, creating a complex funding landscape:

**Medicare Rural Provisions**: Critical Access Hospitals receive cost based Medicare reimbursement, providing financial stability that prospective payment hospitals lack. However, the 2% Medicare sequestration cut costs Georgia rural hospitals an estimated **$8 to $10 million annually**.

**HRSA Programs**: The National Health Service Corps provides loan repayment for providers serving in shortage areas. Georgia participates in various HRSA workforce programs, but available slots cannot address the scale of shortage.

**USDA Rural Health Programs**: The Department of Agriculture administers rural health facility loans and grants, complementing but not duplicating RHTP purposes.

**Georgia's Rural Hospital Tax Credit**: The state created a tax credit allowing individuals and corporations to support rural hospitals, generating approximately **$100 million annually** in private investment. This program provides critical support but relies on voluntary participation and cannot guarantee stable funding.

### State Budget Pressures

Georgia's state budget faces constraints that limit the state's ability to supplement federal funding or expand coverage. The state maintains a **constitutional balanced budget requirement**, preventing deficit spending to address health care needs.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act imposes new costs on Georgia beyond Medicaid cuts. The legislation shifts significant SNAP (food stamp) costs to states for the first time. Maintaining Georgia's current SNAP program would cost the state an estimated **$812 million annually** in new state spending.

Medicaid spending already consumes a significant portion of Georgia's budget. The Department of Community Health manages an annual budget exceeding **$22 billion**, primarily for Medicaid and PeachCare for Kids (Georgia's CHIP program). Any additional state investment in rural health competes with education, transportation, and other priorities.

The state has been actively maneuvering to maximize federal Medicaid funding before cuts take effect. Georgia's Department of Community Health is pursuing State Directed Payment Programs that would draw down an additional **$2.1 billion per year** in federal matching funds by increasing Medicaid payments to hospitals achieving specific goals. This strategy represents defensive positioning rather than transformation.

## The External View

### National Narratives

Georgia occupies a distinctive position in national healthcare debates. The state combines Southern heritage with emerging Sun Belt dynamism, producing tensions between traditional political culture and demographic change.

External observers often view Georgia through the lens of its metropolitan growth, missing the persistent crisis in rural areas. Atlanta's emergence as a healthcare hub, with Emory, Grady, and major health systems attracting talent and investment, creates the impression of a functional healthcare state. The 2.9 million rural Georgians living hours from Atlanta's medical resources experience a different reality.

The Georgia Pathways program has attracted national attention as the only active Medicaid work requirement program in the country. Critics point to Pathways' dismal enrollment as evidence that work requirements cannot expand coverage effectively. Supporters defend the program as preserving work incentives and limiting government dependency. Both perspectives tend to overlook the 175,000 Georgians in the coverage gap for whom Pathways was never designed to help.

Georgia's Black Belt counties feature in national discussions of health disparities and structural racism in healthcare. The persistent poverty of southwest Georgia, rooted in plantation economics and maintained through decades of disinvestment, represents a test case for whether federal investment can overcome historical extraction. External observers recognize the need; few appreciate the depth of challenge.

### Stereotypes Versus Reality

National stereotypes about Georgia tend toward political caricature, missing the complexity of rural communities. External views often assume rural Georgians uniformly oppose government programs, including healthcare expansion. Survey data suggests more nuanced attitudes: rural Georgians want healthcare access and will support programs that deliver it, regardless of ideological labels.

The assumption that rural Georgia is uniformly white overlooks the Black Belt's demographics. Multiple southwest Georgia counties have majority Black populations, descendants of enslaved people who worked the cotton plantations that gave the region its name. These communities face both healthcare deserts and the accumulated trauma of medical mistreatment, from the Tuskegee Syphilis Study's shadow over Alabama extending into Georgia's collective memory.

Economic stereotypes imagine rural Georgia as exclusively agricultural. While agriculture remains important, rural Georgia's economy encompasses timber, manufacturing, tourism, and increasingly, healthcare as the region's largest employer. Hospital closures eliminate not just healthcare access but economic anchors that sustain entire communities.

### What Outsiders Miss

External observers often miss the degree to which rural Georgians have adapted to scarcity. Communities have developed informal care networks, transported neighbors to distant appointments, and maintained resilience despite systematic disinvestment. This resilience is a resource but should not be romanticized as sufficient.

The role of **faith communities** in rural Georgia healthcare goes underappreciated. Churches provide transportation, meals, emotional support, and gathering spaces for health education. Any transformation strategy that ignores the church's central place in rural Georgia community life will struggle to gain traction.

The **agricultural economy's health demands** create specific needs that generic rural health programs miss. Farm workers face occupational hazards, seasonal employment patterns, and often immigration status barriers to accessing care. The poultry processing plants concentrated in rural Georgia create industrial health risks alongside the farm economy.

**Transportation infrastructure** beyond simple distance creates access barriers outsiders underestimate. Roads in rural Georgia may be unpaved, poorly maintained, or flood prone. Public transportation is virtually nonexistent outside metropolitan areas. Even when services exist at a distance, reaching them requires vehicle ownership, insurance, and fuel costs that exceed some families' capacity.

## Politics and Policy

### Political Landscape

Georgia's political environment shapes RHTP implementation possibilities. Governor Brian Kemp, a Republican, has championed Georgia Pathways while resisting full Medicaid expansion. His administration secured RHTP funding and branded it as GREAT Health, positioning the initiative as an alternative to what conservatives characterize as government healthcare expansion.

The state legislature maintains Republican supermajorities in both chambers. Medicaid expansion legislation has been introduced repeatedly but has not received committee hearings. The legislature has been willing to support incremental rural health investments, including the rural hospital tax credit program, but comprehensive coverage expansion remains politically impossible in the current environment.

Georgia's political complexity includes recent competitive statewide elections and ongoing demographic change. The state's two U.S. senators are Democrats who have consistently advocated for Medicaid expansion and opposed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act's healthcare cuts. This divided representation reflects a state in transition, but state level policy remains firmly controlled by expansion opponents.

### Recent Policy Initiatives

Despite rejecting Medicaid expansion, Georgia has pursued various rural health initiatives:

**Georgia Pathways to Coverage** launched in July 2023 as the state's alternative to expansion. The program's struggles have been documented extensively, but the Kemp administration secured a five year extension from CMS, indicating continued commitment to the conditional coverage approach.

**Rural Hospital Tax Credit Program** allows individuals to contribute up to $5,000 and corporations up to $10,000 annually to struggling rural hospitals, receiving equivalent state tax credits. The program has generated approximately $100 million annually but relies on voluntary participation.

**Graduate Medical Education Expansion** initiatives aim to increase residency slots in Georgia, recognizing that physicians tend to practice where they complete residency. The proposed UGA medical school and Savannah dental school campus represent significant investments in workforce pipeline.

**Telehealth Expansion** accelerated during the COVID 19 pandemic, with Georgia's Department of Public Health deploying virtual care capacity across all 159 counties. Permanent telehealth payment parity and regulatory flexibility remain policy priorities.

### Federal Scoring Factors

Georgia's RHTP application was evaluated under CMS scoring criteria that included:

**Rural Population Metrics**: Georgia's large rural population (2.9 million) qualified the state for substantial baseline funding under the formula's 50% equal distribution component.

**Rural Health System Assessment**: The state's high hospital closure rate, workforce shortages, and health outcome disparities documented crisis conditions justifying intervention.

**State Policy Actions**: The NOFO referenced state policy actions that "enhance access and quality of care in rural communities." Georgia Pathways, despite its limitations, demonstrated state action on coverage. The rural hospital tax credit showed public private partnership capacity.

**Application Initiatives**: Georgia's proposed transformation initiatives aligned with statutory priorities including workforce development, technology deployment, and care delivery innovation.

**MAHA Alignment**: The Office of Rural Health Transformation, under CMS Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz, emphasized "Make America Healthy Again" priorities including chronic disease prevention and nutrition. Georgia's application reportedly included elements addressing lifestyle factors in chronic disease.

### Leadership and Coordination

The **Georgia Department of Community Health (DCH)** serves as lead agency for RHTP implementation. DCH manages Medicaid, PeachCare for Kids, the State Health Benefit Plan, Healthcare Facility Regulation, and the **State Office of Rural Health**.

Commissioner Russel Carlson leads DCH and has positioned the agency as responsive to federal policy changes while maximizing available resources. The department conducted public input sessions across the state during the RHTP application process, receiving 169 written submissions from stakeholders.

Dr. Dean Burke serves as Commissioner and has emphasized that GREAT Health will support "rural residents to live longer, healthier lives with access to more effective and higher quality health care." The implementation structure will require coordination across multiple DCH divisions and external partners.

The **Georgia Hospital Association** plays a critical advocacy role, having joined hospital associations from 13 other states in urging Senate leadership to preserve Medicaid during the One Big Beautiful Bill Act debates. The association will likely serve as a key intermediary in RHTP implementation, connecting state resources to member facilities.

### Political Impossibilities

Certain options remain politically unavailable regardless of their potential effectiveness:

**Full Medicaid expansion** under the ACA remains blocked. Despite evidence that expansion would improve rural hospital viability, cover hundreds of thousands of uninsured Georgians, and generate net fiscal benefits for the state, the political coalition necessary to pass expansion does not exist.

**Full nurse practitioner practice authority** has repeatedly failed in the legislature. Medical associations resist scope of practice changes, and the legislature has not overridden this opposition despite workforce crisis severity.

**Direct state subsidies to rural hospitals** face constitutional and political constraints. The balanced budget requirement limits deficit financing, and political priorities favor tax reduction over healthcare spending expansion.

**Certificate of need reform** remains contentious. Georgia's CON laws restrict healthcare facility construction and expansion, potentially limiting competition but also preventing further rural hospital market deterioration.

## What the State Must Do

### Non Negotiable Requirements

RHTP imposes specific requirements Georgia must meet to maintain funding:

**Two Year Spending Obligation**: Georgia must obligate first year funds within two years, meaning by end of 2027. This timeline forces rapid implementation, limiting extended planning periods.

**Three or More Approved Uses**: Georgia must deploy funds across at least three of the statutory approved uses, which include prevention interventions, provider payments, consumer technology solutions, telehealth, workforce recruitment with rural service commitments, IT capacity enhancement, opioid/SUD/mental health services, and others.

**Annual Reporting and Re scoring**: CMS will re score states annually, with authority to adjust funding or implement clawbacks for implementation failures. Georgia must demonstrate progress on committed initiatives.

**MAHA Alignment**: The program emphasizes chronic disease prevention, nutrition, and lifestyle factors. Georgia's implementation must show attention to these priorities.

### Strategic Choices

Within requirements, Georgia retains discretion over:

**Regional Prioritization**: Whether to concentrate resources in the most distressed areas (southwest Georgia Black Belt) or distribute more broadly across all rural counties.

**Workforce Strategy**: Balance between recruiting outside providers (loan repayment, signing bonuses) versus growing local talent (pipeline programs, training support).

**Technology Investment**: Degree of emphasis on telehealth infrastructure, health information exchange, electronic health record adoption, and consumer facing technology.

**Care Model Innovation**: Whether to prioritize hub and spoke networks extending from regional centers, independent community health worker programs, or integrated health system partnerships.

**Social Care Integration**: Extent of investment in social determinants of health (SDOH) screening, community health workers, food security programs, and transportation assistance.

### Timeline Pressures

The implementation timeline creates significant pressure:

**FY2026**: First year funding arrives. Georgia must finalize governance structures, confirm implementation partners, and launch initial programs.

**2027**: Two year obligation deadline approaches. Programs must be operational and spending documented.

**2028 2029**: Full implementation period. Programs mature, outcomes become measurable, and sustainability planning intensifies.

**2030**: Final RHTP year. The "cliff" arrives: what happens when transformation funding ends?

Simultaneously, Medicaid cuts phase in across this timeline, with work requirements beginning January 2027 and cost sharing requirements beginning October 2028. Georgia must implement transformation while the coverage environment deteriorates.

### The 2030 Cliff

RHTP funding ends in 2030. Whatever Georgia builds must either become self sustaining through alternative revenue streams or cease operations. This sunset creates the fundamental strategic question: **what survives?**

Programs that generate ongoing revenue through value based payment, Medicaid reimbursement for new service categories, or commercial payer contracting have sustainability paths. Programs that depend on grant funding without establishing permanent financing face elimination.

The 2030 cliff arrives just as Georgia's healthcare workforce shortage is projected to peak and Medicaid cuts reach full implementation. The timing is brutal: transformation support disappears exactly when cumulative stress on the system reaches maximum intensity.

Georgia's political environment shows no indication of state funding to replace federal transformation support after 2030. RHTP must therefore build structures capable of surviving without ongoing grant funding or accept that investments will prove temporary.

## Conclusion

Georgia faces a fundamental paradox. The state received substantial RHTP funding in absolute terms but receives among the lowest per capita funding due to its large rural population. It must attempt transformation while simultaneously absorbing massive Medicaid cuts, maintaining a partial expansion program that covers a fraction of eligible Georgians, and operating in a political environment that forecloses the coverage expansion rural hospitals need to survive.

The **$218.8 million** annually sounds significant until calculated against **2.9 million rural residents** and **71 rural hospitals**. The funding becomes **$75 per person**, a fraction of what frontier states receive and insufficient to address structural deficits in infrastructure, workforce, and coverage.

Georgia's non expansion status creates a coverage gap that transformation funding cannot close. The state's Pathways program has enrolled approximately **3% of eligible Georgians** after 18 months of operation, demonstrating that conditional coverage approaches cannot achieve meaningful coverage expansion. Meanwhile, **175,000 Georgians** remain in the coverage gap, and Medicaid cuts threaten to push **310,000 or more** off existing coverage.

The rural hospital crisis continues accelerating. **Twenty facilities** face closure risk, and **28 more** face service reductions under projected Medicaid cuts. Each closure reshapes Georgia's healthcare geography, creating longer drives, higher mortality risk, and community economic devastation.

Georgia's Black Belt counties present the transformation challenge in starkest form. These persistent poverty communities have experienced extraction rather than investment for generations. Health disparities reflect accumulated disadvantage that no five year grant program can reverse. Yet if transformation cannot work in the Black Belt, where mortality rates and poverty rates and closure risks concentrate, has it worked at all?

Part 2 examines what Georgia proposes to do with its $218.8 million annual allocation. The GREAT Health program structure, the initiatives the state will pursue, and how funding flows to specific programs and organizations. The plan represents Georgia's theory of change, its bet on which investments can catalyze transformation despite structural constraints.

Part 3 will assess what works, what fails, and what survives when plans meet reality. Whether social care components survive partial funding, how the 2030 cliff shapes implementation choices, and whether $75 per rural Georgian can accomplish anything meaningful against the headwinds Georgia faces.

The stakes are clear: **2.9 million rural Georgians** need healthcare access. They need hospitals that remain open, providers who will practice in their communities, coverage that lets them afford care, and transportation to reach services. They need transformation that addresses the conditions making them sick while ensuring care exists when illness strikes.

Georgia received RHTP funding. Whether that funding becomes transformation or merely temporary mitigation depends on choices the state makes, constraints politics imposes, and whether federal policy continues undermining the foundations transformation requires.
