# RHTP 3.DE: Delaware

*The smallest state's medical school bet: building physician supply from scratch to address healthcare deserts hiding in plain sight.*

## Introduction

Delaware's **$157.4 million FY2026 RHTP award** funds an ambitious gamble on workforce transformation. The state proposes creating Delaware's first four-year medical school, a flagship initiative consuming over $100 million through 2031. This bet reflects Delaware's peculiar position as one of **only three states lacking any medical school**, forcing physician recruitment to compete against neighboring states with established training pipelines.

The state's rural challenge defies the typical profile. Kent and Sussex counties contain **approximately 400,000 residents** representing nearly 40% of Delaware's population, yet these residents live within a geographically compact area where "rural" means scattered agricultural communities and beach towns rather than frontier isolation. Despite this proximity to metropolitan Philadelphia (90 minutes from Dover) and Wilmington (45 minutes from Dover), **rural Delawareans face acute access barriers** including HPSA designations covering entire counties and primary care wait times stretching months.

Delaware's application compiles **15 initiatives** spanning workforce development, mobile care delivery, integrated service hubs, and technology innovation. The approach reflects Governor Matt Meyer's administration prioritizing systemic capacity building over facility construction, wagering that growing Delaware's own healthcare workforce will prove more sustainable than perpetual recruitment competitions with surrounding states.

## Rural Health Landscape

Delaware spans approximately **2,489 square miles** as the second-smallest state geographically. The state's three counties create a simple geographic framework: New Castle County in the north contains Wilmington and most urban development, while **Kent and Sussex counties to the south comprise Delaware's rural territory**. Combined, these two counties cover roughly 1,700 square miles.

**Population Distribution**

| County | Population | State Share | Classification |
|--------|------------|-------------|----------------|
| New Castle | 559,164 | 57.85% | Urban/Suburban |
| Kent | 178,550 | 18.46% | Rural/Mixed |
| Sussex | 229,286 | 23.71% | Rural |
| **State Total** | **~967,000** | **100%** | |

Sussex County leads Delaware population growth at **15.87% increase since the 2010 Census**, driven by retirement migration to coastal communities and affordable housing attracting families priced out of northern Delaware and Maryland's Eastern Shore. Kent County follows at 9.57% growth. This population surge intensifies healthcare demand precisely where supply remains most constrained.

**Healthcare Infrastructure**

Delaware lacks the rural hospital infrastructure found in other states. The state has **no Critical Access Hospitals**, a designation requiring 25 beds or fewer and location more than 35 miles from other hospitals. Delaware's geography and population density prevent facilities from qualifying, leaving rural residents dependent on larger regional systems.

| Facility | Location | Service Area | Key Characteristics |
|----------|----------|--------------|---------------------|
| Bayhealth Hospital, Kent Campus | Dover | Kent County | Primary Kent County facility, Level III trauma |
| Bayhealth Hospital, Sussex Campus | Milford | Northern Sussex | 316 total beds across system |
| Beebe Healthcare | Multiple Sussex locations | Sussex County | Largest Sussex employer, expanding network |
| Nanticoke Memorial Hospital | Seaford | Western Sussex | Community hospital serving underserved area |

Beebe Healthcare has strategically expanded across Sussex County, positioning **mobile health units and satellite facilities** throughout the 950-square-mile county. These mobile units deliver behavioral health, primary care, screenings, and social care services to communities lacking fixed healthcare access points.

**Workforce Crisis**

Delaware's workforce shortage manifests dramatically despite geographic proximity to major medical centers. **The entire Kent County holds HPSA designation** for primary medical and dental care. All rural facilities in Sussex County carry similar shortage designations.

Delaware ranks **worst nationally for primary care access**, with only 16% of primary care needs met as of 2023 data. The state requires approximately **75 additional practitioners** to address current HPSA shortages. Patients in western Sussex County report driving 50 or more miles for specialist appointments and waiting six months or longer for primary care availability.

The absence of any in-state medical school creates a structural pipeline deficit. Delaware's physician workforce depends entirely on recruiting graduates from other states' medical schools or international medical graduates. Neighboring states (Pennsylvania, Maryland, New Jersey) operate multiple medical schools, creating local practice opportunities that compete against Delaware recruitment efforts.

**Health Outcomes**

Sussex County demonstrates significant health disparities despite its reputation as a retirement destination. Bayhealth's 2025 Community Health Needs Assessment identified priority concerns including behavioral health access, chronic disease prevalence, and social determinants affecting health outcomes throughout the service area.

Transportation barriers compound access challenges. **DART First State public transit provides limited service** in Kent and Sussex counties compared to New Castle County coverage. Rural residents without personal vehicles face substantial barriers reaching healthcare appointments, contributing to delayed care and emergency department utilization for conditions manageable in primary care settings.

## RHTP Award and Context

**Award Details**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| FY2026 Allocation | $157,394,964 |
| Five-Year Projection | ~$500 million minimum |
| Amount Requested | $1 billion over five years |
| Per Rural Resident | ~$393 |
| National Award Ranking | Fourth-lowest (ahead of NJ, CT, RI) |
| Medicaid Status | Expansion state |

Delaware requested **$1 billion over five years** but received approximately $157.4 million for FY2026, suggesting actual allocations will fall substantially short of the application's full scope. The **$393 per rural resident** calculation positions Delaware favorably relative to large rural states like Texas (~$60 per rural resident) but reflects the baseline allocation's dominance in small-population states.

**Medicaid Context**

Delaware expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, providing coverage infrastructure supporting RHTP investments. Approximately **237,000 Delawareans** receive Medicaid coverage as of May 2025, with Kent and Sussex counties showing higher Medicaid coverage rates than New Castle County proportional to population.

Federal Medicaid cuts under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act create countervailing pressure. The $911 billion national reduction over ten years will affect Delaware's Medicaid program, potentially undermining coverage stability that rural providers depend upon. Delaware's position as an expansion state means more residents face coverage risk from eligibility restrictions or work requirements than non-expansion states where fewer people enrolled initially.

**Formula Position**

Delaware's small population creates favorable per-capita funding relative to large states, but the state's absolute allocation ranks among the nation's lowest. The formula's $100 million baseline provides substantial resources per rural resident when distributed across 400,000 people rather than Texas's 5 million or California's 3 million rural residents.

## State Approach

**Governance and Lead Agency**

The **Delaware Health and Social Services (DHSS)** serves as lead agency for RHTP implementation under Secretary Christen Linke Young. DHSS submitted the state application on November 5, 2025, coordinating across multiple divisions and external partners to compile the 15-initiative proposal.

Governor Matt Meyer announced the application November 12, 2025, positioning RHTP as fulfilling his State of the State commitment to address rural healthcare disparities. The administration frames RHTP as a "generational plan" for rural Delaware transformation.

**Strategic Framework**

Delaware's approach centers on **four interconnected pillars**:

**Workforce Pipeline Development**: Creating Delaware's first medical school establishes in-state physician training to break dependence on out-of-state recruitment. Financial incentive programs for students committing to rural practice complement the medical school initiative.

**Access Point Multiplication**: Mobile health units, health pods, school-based health centers, and library telehealth sites expand care delivery beyond fixed hospital facilities. This distributed model addresses transportation barriers by bringing care to communities.

**Integrated Service Delivery**: Hope Centers combining healthcare, housing, and employment services under one roof extend the successful New Castle County model to Kent and Sussex counties. This approach recognizes that health outcomes depend on addressing social determinants alongside clinical care.

**Technology Enablement**: Telehealth infrastructure, remote monitoring platforms, and health IT systems modernize care delivery for populations unable to easily access fixed facilities.

**Key Partnerships**

The state's flagship medical school initiative involves **Thomas Jefferson University's Sidney Kimmel Medical College**, which signed a Memorandum of Understanding October 29, 2025. The partnership proceeds in phases: Phase 1 enhances the existing SKMC branch campus at ChristianaCare, while Phase 2 establishes a full four-year medical school in Delaware, potentially in Sussex County. Despite the MOU, DHSS plans competitive procurement with contract award targeted for September 2026 and classes beginning June 2028.

**Beebe Healthcare** positions as the primary Sussex County implementation partner, with President and CEO Dr. David Tam publicly supporting the application and committing Beebe resources to multiple initiatives. **Bayhealth Medical Center** serves similar roles in Kent County.

## Program and Funding Distribution

**Note**: Specific allocations beyond the medical school initiative remain unpublished as of January 2026. The $100.4 million medical school figure represents funding through 2031, not annual allocation.

## Social Care Integration

| Component | Included | Estimated Funding | Implementing Organization | Likely Funded? |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|--------------------------|----------------|
| SDOH/HRSN | Yes | Embedded | Hope Centers, mobile units | At Risk |
| CHW Programs | Yes | Embedded in workforce | Training programs | At Risk |
| CIE Platform | Not explicit | Unknown | None identified | Unknown |
| Food is Medicine | Yes | TBD | TBD | At Risk |

**SDOH/HRSN Integration**

Delaware's application embeds social care throughout clinical initiatives rather than creating standalone SDOH programs. The **Hope Center model** explicitly integrates healthcare with housing and employment services, recognizing that stable housing and income influence health outcomes more than clinical interventions alone. Mobile health units similarly combine behavioral health, primary care, and social care delivery.

The **Food is Medicine Infrastructure Initiative** addresses nutrition as a health determinant, funding prescription groceries and nutrition education programs. This component represents the most explicit SDOH intervention in Delaware's application, connecting food security to health outcomes.

**Community Health Worker Programs**

CHW deployment appears embedded within workforce training initiatives rather than established as a distinct program. The **Training Programs for Clinical Support Roles** includes CHWs alongside nurses, dental professionals, and allied health workers. No specific CHW FTE targets or deployment geography appear in available application materials.

**Community Information Exchange**

Delaware's application **does not explicitly include CIE platform procurement**. The technology emphasis focuses on telehealth expansion and health IT infrastructure (prior authorization, insurance verification) rather than closed-loop social service referral systems. The Delaware Health Information Network (DHIN) may provide baseline interoperability infrastructure, but explicit CIE deployment funding remains unclear.

This represents a potential gap relative to states prioritizing comprehensive SDOH platforms connecting healthcare with social services. Delaware may rely on existing 211 systems or provider-specific referral networks rather than statewide CIE infrastructure.

## Key Subawardees

Final subaward announcements await FY2026 fund disbursement, but anticipated recipients based on application content and partnership announcements include:

- **Delaware Public Libraries**: Library telehealth initiative implementation across nine rural locations.
- **School Districts**: School-based health center expansion partnerships.

**Technology Vendors**
- **To be determined**: Catalyst Fund recipients for telehealth and remote monitoring innovation. Competitive application process announced.

## Assessment

**Strengths**

**Strategic Clarity**. Delaware's bet on workforce pipeline development addresses the structural cause of access shortages rather than symptoms. Creating in-state medical education capacity could transform physician supply over a decade.

**Compact Geography**. Unlike western frontier states where distance defeats intervention, Delaware's rural population concentrates in a 1,700-square-mile area. Mobile health units and satellite facilities can realistically cover the territory.

**Medicaid Foundation**. Expansion status provides coverage infrastructure supporting care delivery investments. Rural providers have Medicaid revenue streams funding operations alongside RHTP transformation dollars.

**Committed Healthcare Partners**. Beebe Healthcare and Bayhealth have publicly committed to RHTP implementation with existing infrastructure and community presence. These are not paper partnerships.

**Integrated Service Model**. Hope Centers combining healthcare, housing, and employment services reflect evidence that social determinants drive health outcomes. This approach shows sophistication beyond clinical-only thinking.

**Vulnerabilities**

**Medical School Timeline Risk**. The flagship initiative requires Phase 1 enhancement by 2026, competitive procurement completing September 2026, and classes beginning June 2028. Any delay cascades through the entire strategy. Graduates practicing in rural Delaware arrive in 2032 at earliest, beyond RHTP's 2030 sunset.

**Funding Gap**. Delaware requested $1 billion but received $157 million annually. The 15-initiative application cannot execute at full scope. Priority decisions will eliminate or scale back multiple programs, with social care components most vulnerable.

**No CIE Infrastructure**. Unlike states building comprehensive closed-loop referral systems, Delaware's application lacks explicit CIE platform funding. Social care integration depends on existing fragmented systems rather than purpose-built infrastructure.

**Federal Medicaid Exposure**. Expansion states face proportionally larger impacts from federal Medicaid cuts. Delaware's rural providers risk losing Medicaid revenue that RHTP cannot replace.

**Small Scale Limits Learning**. Delaware's 400,000 rural residents and three-county geography limit the scale of transformation efforts. Lessons learned may not transfer to larger states with different constraints.

**Sustainability Prospects**

Delaware's medical school represents the **highest sustainability potential** of any initiative. Once established, a medical school operates independently of RHTP funding through tuition, clinical revenue, and state support. Graduates entering Delaware practice create permanent workforce expansion.

Other initiatives face standard sustainability challenges. Mobile health units require ongoing operational funding. Hope Centers need sustained state commitment. School-based health centers depend on school district budgets. Without continued federal support or state general fund commitment, infrastructure investments risk becoming stranded.

**Critical Success Factors**

1. **Medical school timeline execution**: Procurement completing September 2026, construction proceeding on schedule
2. **Partner capacity**: Beebe and Bayhealth successfully absorbing expanded service delivery responsibilities
3. **Medicaid stability**: Federal Medicaid cuts not eliminating coverage gains supporting rural provider revenue
4. **Priority decisions**: Allocation choices preserving highest-impact initiatives when $1 billion request meets $500 million reality
5. **Workforce retention**: Financial incentive programs actually retaining graduates in rural Delaware practice

## Conclusion

Delaware's RHTP strategy represents a **long-term workforce bet** rather than immediate access expansion. The medical school initiative, consuming over $100 million, produces no practicing physicians until 2032 at earliest. Rural Delawareans waiting months for primary care appointments receive no near-term relief from this flagship investment.

The supporting initiatives (mobile units, Hope Centers, school-based health centers, library telehealth) provide more immediate access improvements but face uncertain funding given the gap between Delaware's $1 billion request and likely $500 million allocation. **Which programs survive priority decisions will determine whether Delaware's rural residents experience transformation or administrative activity**.

The state's compact geography and committed healthcare partners create favorable implementation conditions relative to frontier states where distance defeats intervention. If Delaware executes the medical school initiative successfully while maintaining near-term access programs, the strategy could produce sustainable improvement. If the medical school stalls or funding gaps eliminate supporting programs, Delaware will have spent substantial resources building capacity that benefits future generations while current rural residents continue waiting for care.

**What to Watch**

- Q3 2026 medical school procurement completion and selected partner announcement
- FY2026 subaward announcements revealing priority decisions across 15 initiatives
- Hope Center site selection and construction timeline for Kent and Sussex facilities
- Mobile health unit deployment expansion and utilization data
- Medicaid enrollment trends indicating coverage stability or erosion
