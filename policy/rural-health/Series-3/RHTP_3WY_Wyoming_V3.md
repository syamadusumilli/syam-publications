# RHTP 3.WY: Wyoming

*The most favorable funding position in the nation meets the most extreme geographic isolation: frontier transformation with unprecedented per capita resources.*

## Introduction

Wyoming's **$205 million FY2026 RHTP award** delivers approximately **$554 per rural resident**, the highest or second highest per capita allocation nationally depending on calculation methodology. For the least populous state in the union, this funding level represents an extraordinary federal investment relative to population, creating what may be the most favorable transformation opportunity available under RHTP's funding architecture.

The paradox of Wyoming's position lies in the stark contrast between **resource abundance and implementation complexity**. The state spans 97,813 square miles with just 587,000 residents, creating population densities that render conventional healthcare delivery models economically impossible. Seventeen of Wyoming's 23 counties qualify as **frontier territory** with fewer than six people per square mile. Some counties average less than one person per square mile, an isolation so extreme that no healthcare infrastructure, regardless of funding level, can eliminate the fundamental challenge of distance.

Wyoming's approach centers on **consolidation and right-sizing** rather than expansion. The state's application explicitly acknowledges that its rural hospital and EMS systems cannot be sustained in their current configuration and proposes fundamental restructuring around what the state terms "sustainable payer sources." This represents unusual candor in an application environment where most states promise transformation through addition rather than subtraction.

## Rural Health Landscape

**Geographic Reality**

Wyoming ranks as the **tenth largest state by area** while claiming the smallest population of any state, creating the most extreme mismatch between territory and population in the nation. The state stretches across multiple ecoregions from the Great Plains in the east to the Rocky Mountains in the west, with terrain that includes high desert, mountain passes, and river valleys that freeze for months each winter.

Only **two counties**, Laramie (Cheyenne) and Natrona (Casper), contain populations exceeding 60,000 and qualify as urban. These two counties anchor opposite ends of the state's population corridor along Interstate 80 and Interstate 25. The remaining 21 counties range from small rural to extreme frontier, with **17 classified as frontier** using the standard threshold of fewer than six people per square mile. These frontier counties contain approximately **45% of the state's population** despite comprising the vast majority of its land area.

**Healthcare Infrastructure**

| Facility Type | Count | Notes |
|---------------|-------|-------|
| Critical Access Hospitals | ~15 | Scattered across frontier territory |
| Rural Health Clinics | 45+ | Concentrated in accessible areas |
| FQHCs | 8 sites | Limited geographic coverage |
| Wind River IHS Hospital | 1 | Central Wyoming reservation |
| General acute hospitals | ~26 total | Including CAHs |

Wyoming's hospital network reflects the impossibility of sustaining standard infrastructure in frontier conditions. **Critical Access Hospitals serve communities** where no conventional hospital model could survive, yet even with cost-based Medicare reimbursement, many face chronic financial stress. The state's application notes that Medicare cost coverage for CAHs has held roughly stable, but coverage from private insurers has eroded significantly.

**Medicare Advantage penetration** increased from 3% in 2020 to 17% in 2024, creating new financial pressure on rural facilities. MA plans frequently employ prior authorization requirements and claims denials that reduce effective reimbursement rates below what traditional Medicare provides. This trend threatens facilities that depend on Medicare revenue stability.

**EMS Crisis**

Wyoming's emergency medical services represent the most acute infrastructure challenge. The state estimates that between **71 and 113 ambulances** must be on call at any given moment to provide adequate coverage, at an annual fixed cost of approximately **$66.5 million**. Actual EMS revenue from billing covers only **$36.7 million**, creating a structural gap filled by volunteer labor, local tax subsidies, and hospital cross-subsidization.

Only the **three largest EMS services** achieve utilization rates above the 30% benchmark typically needed for financial sustainability. Many smaller services respond to fewer than 100 calls annually while maintaining the same readiness requirements as high-volume operations. This fundamental economics problem cannot be solved through increased funding alone but requires the regionalization and consolidation Wyoming proposes.

**Ground EMS response times** vary dramatically by location. Some areas enjoy response times under 9 minutes comparable to urban standards. Others face **30+ minute response times** that transform survivable emergencies into fatal events. The state's application documents these disparities with unusual geographic precision, acknowledging that no realistic funding level can provide urban-equivalent EMS access to frontier communities.

**Workforce Shortages**

The entire state of Wyoming is designated as a **Health Professional Shortage Area for mental health**, with only 41% of mental health needs currently met and 28 additional psychiatrists needed to reach adequacy. Primary care and dental HPSAs cover significant portions of the state, with **186,000 residents** living in primary care shortage areas.

Physician distribution reflects population concentration:

| Specialty | Statewide Count | Laramie County | Natrona County | All Other Counties |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Family Practice | 274 | 69 | 51 | 154 |
| OB-GYN | 48 | ~15 | ~12 | ~21 |
| Pediatrics | 61 | ~18 | ~14 | ~29 |

**Five counties have five or fewer family practice physicians**, and several have none at all. For specialty care, residents routinely travel to Cheyenne, Casper, or out of state entirely. The absence of any **Level III trauma center** in Wyoming means serious injuries require transport to facilities in Colorado, Utah, or Montana.

**Nursing workforce** pressures intensified dramatically during and after the pandemic. Average hourly wages for nurses increased sharply since 2020, while employment levels remained flat or declined for positions like **Certified Nursing Assistants**. Many facilities still rely on expensive travel nurse contracts to maintain minimum staffing levels, eroding financial margins further.

**Wind River Indian Reservation**

The **Wind River Indian Reservation** in central Wyoming is home to two federally recognized tribes, the Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho. With approximately **26,000 residents**, the reservation represents a significant population concentration in otherwise sparsely populated Fremont County.

Health outcomes on the reservation reflect patterns seen in tribal communities nationally, with elevated rates of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and behavioral health conditions. The **Wind River Service Unit** of the Indian Health Service operates healthcare facilities on the reservation, but chronic underfunding affects IHS operations everywhere and Wind River is no exception.

RHTP funds flow through the state rather than directly to tribal health systems, creating implementation complexity. Wyoming's application references consultation with tribal stakeholders, but the degree to which RHTP investment reaches reservation communities will depend on state decisions about subaward structures and geographic prioritization.

**Medicaid Context**

Wyoming is one of only **ten states that have not expanded Medicaid**, leaving an estimated **11,000 residents in the coverage gap**. These individuals earn too much to qualify for Wyoming's restrictive Medicaid eligibility (parents must earn below 43% of the federal poverty level) but too little to receive ACA marketplace subsidies, which begin at 100% FPL.

Approximately **62,000 Wyomingites** are enrolled in Medicaid/CHIP, representing only modest growth from pre-ACA levels. The state's Medicaid program primarily serves children, pregnant women, the elderly needing long-term care, and people with disabilities. The **14.8% uninsured rate** among non-elderly adults significantly exceeds the national average of approximately 10%.

Non-expansion status creates compounding challenges for RHTP implementation. Rural providers serving uninsured patients cannot bill Medicaid for those services, reducing revenue available to support transformation initiatives. The lack of coverage expansion also means RHTP investments cannot build on a Medicaid foundation the way expansion states can.

## RHTP Award and Context

**Funding Position**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| FY2026 Allocation | $205,411,653 |
| Baseline Component | $100,000,000 |
| Workload Component | ~$105,000,000 |
| Five-Year Projected Total | ~$800 million to $1 billion |
| Per Rural Resident | ~$554 |
| National Ranking (Absolute) | Mid-tier |
| National Ranking (Per Capita) | Top 2 |

Wyoming requested approximately **$200 million for Year 1** and received $205 million, indicating strong CMS assessment of the application. The award slightly exceeded the request, unusual among states and suggesting the formula calculation favored Wyoming's frontier characteristics.

The **$100 million baseline** delivered equally to all approved states provides approximately **$270 per rural resident** before any workload factors apply. This baseline advantage explains why small-population frontier states consistently lead per capita rankings regardless of specific application quality.

**Formula Mechanics**

Wyoming's per capita advantage of approximately **$554 per rural resident** dwarfs allocations in large rural states. Texas receives roughly $60 per rural resident. North Carolina receives approximately $63. Even states with strong applications and genuine rural health crises cannot overcome the formula's structural bias toward small populations.

This creates an unusual burden of opportunity. Wyoming has the resources to attempt genuine transformation rather than simply maintaining inadequate systems. Whether the state capitalizes on this position depends entirely on implementation choices over the next five years.

**Medicaid Gap Analysis**

As a non-expansion state, Wyoming faces modest Medicaid exposure to H.R. 1 cuts compared to expansion states experiencing the full weight of federal reductions. However, the state's existing Medicaid program still supports significant healthcare infrastructure, particularly long-term care and services for people with disabilities.

KFF projects relatively limited federal Medicaid spending reductions in Wyoming compared to states with large expansion populations. Combined with the substantial RHTP allocation, Wyoming may achieve a **net positive position** in the federal health policy changes enacted through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. This contrasts sharply with states like California or New York where RHTP awards represent a small fraction of projected Medicaid losses.

## State Approach

**Governance Structure**

The **Wyoming Department of Health** serves as lead agency, with Director **Stefan Johansson** overseeing implementation. The department conducted extensive stakeholder engagement during application development, hosting eight in-person meetings and three virtual sessions across the state from Newcastle to Lander, Buffalo to Saratoga. An online survey gathered **1,300 responses** from residents regarding healthcare priorities.

This engagement process surfaced consistent themes that shaped the application:

- **Improve financial viability** of small rural hospitals for basic services
- **Expand affordable health insurance options**
- **Recruit and retain primary care physicians**
- **Train and recruit nurses and direct care workforce**
- **Strengthen OB-GYN services** and labor/delivery capacity

**Four Core Initiatives**

Wyoming's application structures activity across four initiatives rather than the more fragmented approach many states adopted.

**Initiative 1: Basic Medical Care Access**

The centerpiece of Wyoming's approach involves **consolidation and right-sizing** of the hospital and EMS system. This includes:

**Critical Access Hospital, Basic (CAHB) Designation**: A new classification for smaller facilities that provide essential services without full CAH scope. Facilities accepting CAHB status would receive:
- **101% cost-based Medicaid reimbursement** (requiring state policy change beyond RHTP)
- One-time swing-bed conversion grants improving financial sustainability
- Technical assistance for operational transformation

**EMS Regionalization**: The application proposes consolidating smaller ambulance services into regional systems that share overhead costs while maintaining local response capacity. Larger ambulance services would partially subsidize the fixed costs of readiness in smaller locations, recognizing that **utilization-based funding cannot sustain frontier EMS** regardless of payment rates.

**Maternal Health**: Strengthening labor and delivery services in facilities that can sustainably offer them rather than spreading obstetric capability across marginal programs.

**Initiative 2: Rural Workforce Supply**

Workforce development focuses on pipeline creation and retention incentives:

- **Expanded nursing education** capacity and career pathways
- **Paramedic training programs** integrated with EMS regionalization
- **Physician residency slots** with rural training components
- **Five-year service commitments** for graduates receiving RHTP support
- **Scope of practice expansion** for advanced practice providers

The application acknowledges that workforce solutions require both immediate recruitment incentives and long-term pipeline investments that may not yield results until after RHTP funding concludes.

**Initiative 3: Health Promotion**

Chronic disease prevention focuses on the **dietary and lifestyle factors** driving Wyoming's elevated diabetes and cardiovascular disease rates:

- Healthy eating initiatives aligned with MAHA priorities
- Exercise and lifestyle programs adapted to frontier geography
- Behavioral health integration with primary care

The application notes that Wyoming has collaborated on a SNAP waiver requesting permission to restrict candy and soft drinks from SNAP purchases, with legislation passing through the Joint Labor, Health and Social Services Committee for the 2026 Budget Session. This alignment with Trump administration priorities on food policy likely strengthened the application's scoring.

**Initiative 4: Health Technology Transformation**

Technology deployment addresses both provider capability and patient access:

- **Statewide tele-specialty platform** beginning with psychiatry and crisis stabilization
- **Remote patient monitoring** expansion for chronic disease management
- **Consumer-facing digital tools** for health management
- Technology adoption incentives for rural providers

The tele-psychiatry emphasis directly targets the statewide mental health HPSA designation, potentially providing specialist access that no amount of recruitment could achieve given Wyoming's isolation.

**BearCare: The Unusual Proposal**

Wyoming's application includes **BearCare**, a proposed state-operated public health benefit plan covering catastrophic emergencies. Named for the scenario of being attacked by a bear in Wyoming's wilderness, BearCare would provide limited coverage for major medical emergencies at lower monthly cost than comprehensive ACA-compliant plans.

The concept emerged from stakeholder feedback indicating that **health insurance affordability** was a primary barrier to coverage. BearCare would not cover routine care, preventive services, or chronic disease management. Instead, it provides financial protection against catastrophic events for individuals who might otherwise go uninsured.

Critics note that BearCare resembles **fixed indemnity plans** that exist outside ACA regulatory requirements and do not provide comprehensive coverage. Supporters argue it offers something rather than nothing for people priced out of the marketplace, particularly after ACA premium tax credit expiration increased costs dramatically for many Wyoming residents.

CMS approved the application including BearCare, which the Wyoming Department of Health interprets as federal acceptance of the concept. Implementation will require state legislative action and represents a **small component** of the overall RHTP budget.

**Wyoming Health Transformation Perpetuity**

Recognizing RHTP's temporary five-year structure, Wyoming proposes establishing a **perpetuity fund** as an actively managed investment account designed to generate long-term returns sustaining transformation initiatives after 2030. This represents unusual attention to sustainability in an application environment where most states defer post-2030 questions.

The perpetuity proposal requires legislative establishment and appropriation, with Joint Appropriations Committee consideration already underway.

## Program Allocation Framework

| Initiative | Focus | Estimated Allocation | Key Components |
|------------|-------|---------------------|----------------|
| Basic Medical Care | Access | ~$80M | CAHB conversion, EMS regionalization, maternal health |
| Workforce Supply | Pipeline | ~$50M | Nursing education, paramedic training, residencies, retention |
| Health Promotion | Prevention | ~$25M | Chronic disease, diet/exercise, behavioral health integration |
| Technology | Access | ~$35M | Tele-specialty, remote monitoring, digital tools |
| Administration/Perpetuity | Sustainability | ~$15M | Program management, perpetuity fund seed |

*Allocations estimated based on application narrative; final budget submitted to CMS in January 2026.*

## Key Subawardees

As of January 2026, specific subaward announcements remain pending. Based on application content and Wyoming's healthcare landscape, anticipated key recipients include:

**Hospital Systems**
- **Banner Health Wyoming Medical Center**: Casper-based regional system likely to participate in regionalization and technology initiatives
- **Cheyenne Regional Medical Center**: Southeastern Wyoming anchor potentially receiving workforce and specialty access funding

**Critical Access Hospitals**
- Multiple CAHs across frontier territory expected to receive CAHB conversion support and technology adoption funding

**Associations and Networks**
- **Wyoming Hospital Association**: Coordination and technical assistance role
- **Wyoming Medical Society**: Physician recruitment and retention
- **Wyoming Primary Care Association**: FQHC network development

**Educational Institutions**
- **University of Wyoming**: Nursing and allied health education expansion
- **Casper College** and community colleges: Certificate and associate degree programs

**Tribal Entities**
- **Wind River Service Unit (IHS)**: Potential collaboration on telehealth and workforce
- **Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho Tribes**: Consultation and potential direct funding

## Social Care Integration

Wyoming's application **does not emphasize social determinants of health or community information exchange** platforms to the degree many states did. The technology focus centers on clinical telehealth and remote monitoring rather than social service referral networks.

**SDOH/HRSN Status**

| Component | Application Status | Funding Allocation | Survival Assessment |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| SDOH Screening | Not explicitly required | Embedded | Uncertain |
| HRSN Navigation | Limited | Not distinct | Low priority |
| CHW Programs | Not prominent | Not distinct | Not emphasized |
| CIE Platform | Not proposed | None | Not pursued |

This represents a notable gap compared to states that built SDOH infrastructure into their applications. Wyoming's approach assumes health outcomes improve primarily through **clinical access and chronic disease prevention** rather than social care integration.

The absence of CIE infrastructure means Wyoming will not be developing the closed-loop referral systems connecting healthcare providers to housing, food, transportation, and other social services. For a state where social service infrastructure is already thin, this may represent a missed opportunity, or a pragmatic recognition that building sophisticated referral networks in frontier territory is unrealistic.

**Community Health Workers**

CHW deployment does not appear as a distinct initiative in Wyoming's application. Workforce emphasis focuses on **clinical roles** including nurses, paramedics, and physicians rather than community-based health workers. This contrasts with states that view CHWs as essential for reaching underserved populations with prevention and care coordination services.

## Assessment

**Strengths**

**Extraordinary Per Capita Resources**. Wyoming's **$554 per rural resident** creates opportunity unavailable to states receiving $60-$100 per capita. If implementation executes effectively, the state can pursue comprehensive transformation rather than marginal improvement.

**Realistic Consolidation Strategy**. The application's explicit acknowledgment that the current hospital and EMS system cannot be sustained demonstrates unusual candor. Proposing **right-sizing rather than universal preservation** positions Wyoming to build sustainable infrastructure rather than temporarily subsidizing failing models.

**Favorable Medicaid Gap Position**. As a non-expansion state with limited federal Medicaid exposure, Wyoming may achieve net positive position from H.R. 1's combined RHTP investment and Medicaid changes. This provides implementation stability unavailable to states facing massive coverage erosion.

**Political Alignment**. Wyoming's emphasis on healthy eating, exercise, and lifestyle factors aligns with MAHA priorities. The SNAP restriction waiver and BearCare proposal demonstrate willingness to pursue approaches the current administration favors.

**Perpetuity Fund Innovation**. Explicit attention to post-2030 sustainability through an investment fund structure suggests longer-term thinking than most applications demonstrate.

**Vulnerabilities**

**Non-Expansion Coverage Gap**. The **11,000 residents** caught in the coverage gap have no pathway to insurance under Wyoming's current policy framework. BearCare may provide catastrophic protection but does not address comprehensive coverage needs. RHTP investments in care delivery struggle to achieve full impact when significant populations lack coverage.

**Wind River Implementation Uncertainty**. The reservation's 26,000 residents include populations with severe health disparities. Whether RHTP funding reaches tribal communities proportionate to need depends on subaward decisions yet to be made. The application references tribal consultation but does not specify reservation-directed funding.

**SDOH Infrastructure Absence**. The lack of community information exchange, CHW deployment, or explicit social care integration may limit RHTP's ability to address non-clinical factors driving poor health outcomes. Wyoming's social service infrastructure is thin, and RHTP will not build connections between healthcare and social support.

**Consolidation Execution Risk**. Proposing hospital and EMS consolidation is easier than achieving it. Communities facing facility conversion or closure will resist regardless of financial logic. Political pressure may undermine consolidation plans before they generate efficiency gains.

**ACA Subsidy Expiration Fallout**. Premium increases following enhanced tax credit expiration will increase uninsured rates in Wyoming, potentially reversing coverage gains and adding financial pressure to providers already facing thin margins.

**Sustainability Prospects**

Wyoming's perpetuity fund proposal offers the most explicit sustainability mechanism of any state application reviewed. If the legislature establishes the fund with adequate seed capital and investment returns meet projections, some RHTP initiatives could continue beyond 2030 without federal replacement funding.

However, perpetuity funds cannot sustain the full scope of proposed transformation. Post-2030 continuation requires:

- **State general fund commitment** from a legislature historically resistant to new spending
- **Successful value-based payment transition** generating provider revenue independent of grants
- **Federal program renewal** or replacement
- **Perpetuity fund performance** meeting optimistic return assumptions

The consolidation strategy improves sustainability prospects by reducing ongoing costs rather than adding infrastructure requiring permanent subsidy. A right-sized system serving fewer locations more efficiently may prove sustainable where the current configuration cannot.

**Critical Success Factors**

1. **Consolidation execution**: Whether hospital and EMS restructuring achieves efficiency gains before political opposition blocks implementation
2. **Wind River proportionality**: Whether reservation communities receive investment reflecting their health disparities
3. **Workforce pipeline timing**: Whether education investments yield graduates before current workforce retires
4. **Legislative cooperation**: Whether the 2026 Budget Session appropriates funds and establishes the perpetuity structure
5. **BearCare viability**: Whether the catastrophic coverage model proves functional or creates adverse selection problems

## Conclusion

Wyoming enters RHTP implementation with **structural advantages unavailable to any other state**: the highest or second-highest per capita funding, favorable Medicaid gap position, and explicit permission from CMS to pursue unconventional approaches like BearCare. The application demonstrates **unusual realism** about the impossibility of sustaining current infrastructure and proposes consolidation rather than preservation.

The **central question is not whether Wyoming has adequate resources**, but whether the state can convert those resources into sustainable transformation of frontier healthcare delivery. This requires executing consolidation that reduces costs, building workforce pipelines that produce results after years of investment, and establishing perpetuity structures that outlive the five-year grant period.

Wyoming's isolation defines its challenge. **No funding level can make frontier territory function like a metropolitan area**. RHTP success in Wyoming means building the best possible system given the constraints of geography rather than overcoming those constraints entirely. This may be the most achievable goal of any state's application, accepting limitation rather than promising transformation beyond what resources permit.

**What to Watch**

- **February-March 2026**: Legislative action on fund appropriation and perpetuity establishment
- **March-April 2026**: RFP release for major initiatives; subaward structure revealing geographic and population priorities
- **May-June 2026**: Initial awards made; implementation begins
- **2026 interim session**: Scope of practice and licensure compact legislation enabling workforce flexibility
- **Q3-Q4 2026**: CAHB and EMS regionalization progress; first evidence of consolidation execution

Wyoming's RHTP trajectory will reveal whether extraordinary per capita resources translate into frontier communities receiving transformation benefits, or whether formula advantage proves insufficient to overcome the fundamental challenge of providing healthcare across territory where almost nobody lives.
