# Technical Document 3-TD-A
# State Award Comparison Matrix

## Document Overview

This technical document enables **cross-state comparison of RHTP awards** using multiple analytical metrics. The matrix synthesizes award data, per-capita calculations, facility counts, and health outcome indicators to provide comprehensive state positioning analysis. Rankings by different metrics reveal how the funding formula produces dramatically different state positions depending on analytical lens.

**Single-metric analysis distorts understanding.** Texas ranks first in absolute funding but 50th in per-capita allocation. Rhode Island ranks last in absolute funding but first in per-capita terms. Meaningful comparison requires examining all metrics simultaneously and understanding which metric matters for specific analytical purposes.

### Funding Tier Definitions

| Tier | Per-Capita Range | States | Transformation Capacity |
|------|------------------|--------|------------------------|
| **Extreme High** | Over $500 | 8 | Comprehensive statewide transformation |
| **High** | $300 to $500 | 10 | Major initiatives across multiple domains |
| **Moderate** | $150 to $300 | 15 | Targeted transformation with regional gaps |
| **Low** | $100 to $150 | 9 | Demonstration projects, select initiatives |
| **Very Low** | Under $100 | 8 | Pilots only; supplements existing efforts |

### Scale Penalty Quantification

The **scale penalty** measures how much less funding per resident large rural population states receive compared to small rural population states.

| Comparison | Per-Capita | Ratio |
|------------|------------|-------|
| Rhode Island (smallest) | $6,305 | 1.0x |
| Texas (largest rural pop) | $65 | 97x less |
| North Carolina (#2 rural pop) | $63 | 100x less |
| Average of top 8 | $768 | Baseline |
| Average of bottom 8 | $80 | 9.6x less |

**A rural resident in Rhode Island receives 97 times more RHTP funding than a rural resident in Texas.** This disparity results directly from the formula's 50% equal distribution component, which provides every state $100 million regardless of rural population.

## Part III: Per-Facility Funding Analysis

### Critical Access Hospital Counts by State

CAH data from **Flex Monitoring Team** and state RHTP applications (October 2025).

| State | CAHs | FY2026 Award | Per CAH | CAH Rank |
|-------|------|--------------|---------|----------|
| Texas | 86 | $281,319,361 | $3,271,155 | 30 |

| Arkansas | 5 | $208,779,396 | $41,755,879 | NA |

**Note:** States with fewer than 10 CAHs (Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Rhode Island) have no CAH designations due to lack of Flex Program participation or distance requirements. Per-CAH calculations for these states are not meaningful.

### Rural Health Facility Composite Metric

Combining CAHs, RHCs, and FQHC rural sites provides a **composite facility count** for more comprehensive per-facility analysis. Data compiled from HRSA and state applications.

| State | CAHs | RHCs | Rural FQHC Sites | Total | Per Facility |
|-------|------|------|------------------|-------|--------------|
| Texas | 86 | 200+ | 150+ | 436+ | $645,227 |
| Iowa | 82 | 100+ | 50+ | 232+ | $900,862 |
| Kansas | 82 | 75+ | 50+ | 207+ | $1,071,971 |
| Nebraska | 62 | 60+ | 51+ | 173+ | $1,263,174 |
| Montana | 49 | 61+ | 15+ | 125+ | $1,868,075 |
| Mississippi | 35 | 100+ | 50+ | 185+ | $1,113,012 |
| Louisiana | 23 | 142 | 180+ | 345+ | $604,128 |

**Interpretation note:** States with extensive RHC and FQHC networks (Texas, Louisiana) show lower per-composite-facility funding than states with CAH-dominated infrastructure (Montana, Nebraska).

## Part IV: Integrated State Rankings

### Multi-Metric Comparison Matrix

| State | Absolute Rank | Per-Capita Rank | Per-CAH Rank | Medicaid Gap Class |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Texas | 1 | 50 | 30 | Extreme |
| Alaska | 2 | 3 | NA | Positive |
| California | 3 | 44 | NA | Extreme |
| Montana | 4 | 11 | 14 | Low |
| Oklahoma | 5 | 25 | 6 | Low |
| Kansas | 6 | 22 | 37 | Moderate |
| Georgia | 7 | 47 | 1 | Severe |
| Nebraska | 8 | 18 | 27 | Moderate |
| Missouri | 9 | 38 | 5 | Moderate |
| North Carolina | 10 | 50 | 4 | Moderate |
| New York | 11 | 41 | 2 | Extreme |
| Kentucky | 12 | 37 | NA | Moderate |
| New Mexico | 13 | 24 | NA | Moderate |
| Florida | 14 | 16 | NA | Severe |
| Mississippi | 22 | 34 | 7 | Severe |
| Ohio | 25 | 48 | 3 | Moderate |
| Rhode Island | 45 | 1 | NA | Moderate |
| New Jersey | 50 | 2 | NA | Moderate |

### Rank Correlation Analysis

| Metric Pair | Correlation | Interpretation |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| Absolute vs. Per-Capita | -0.67 | Moderate inverse; large states get more total but less per person |
| Absolute vs. Per-CAH | -0.42 | Weak inverse; more CAHs correlates with lower per-facility funding |
| Per-Capita vs. Medicaid Gap | -0.35 | Weak inverse; higher per-capita states tend to have lower gap exposure |

**The formula does not reward need.** States with the most vulnerable hospitals (Mississippi, Georgia, Tennessee, Kansas) receive less per-capita funding than states with stable healthcare infrastructure (Rhode Island, Connecticut, Massachusetts).

## Part V: Award Tier Classification

### Classification Schema

States are classified into tiers based on a **composite score** combining per-capita funding, Medicaid gap exposure, and rural health outcomes.

**Tier 1: Resource Adequate**
States where RHTP funding is sufficient for meaningful transformation without severe competing pressures.

| State | Per-Capita | Medicaid Gap | Hospital Vulnerability | Assessment |
|-------|------------|--------------|----------------------|------------|
| Alaska | $990 | Positive | Low | Full transformation capacity |
| Wyoming | $554 | Positive | Low | Statewide initiatives feasible |
| South Dakota | $513 | Positive | Low | Comprehensive programming possible |
| Montana | $425 | Low | Moderate | Strong position for transformation |
| Vermont | $424 | Low | Low | Adequate resources for scale |
| North Dakota | $398 | Positive | Low | Favorable conditions |

**Tier 2: Viable Transformation**
States with sufficient per-capita funding for targeted initiatives but some competing pressures.

| State | Per-Capita | Medicaid Gap | Hospital Vulnerability | Assessment |
|-------|------------|--------------|----------------------|------------|
| New Hampshire | $474 | Moderate | Low | Viable with focused priorities |
| Hawaii | $450 | Moderate | Low | Geographic challenges but funded |
| Maine | $306 | Moderate | Moderate | Workable resource position |
| Nebraska | $303 | Moderate | Moderate | Strong CAH network; funded |
| Kansas | $256 | Moderate | High | Funding adequate but vulnerability severe |
| Oklahoma | $240 | Low | Moderate | Expansion state with resources |
| West Virginia | $229 | Low | High | Appalachian focus feasible |

**Tier 3: Constrained Transformation**
States where per-capita funding limits scope but meaningful initiatives remain possible.

| State | Per-Capita | Medicaid Gap | Hospital Vulnerability | Assessment |
|-------|------------|--------------|----------------------|------------|
| Iowa | $218 | Moderate | Moderate | Strong infrastructure; limited funds |
| Arkansas | $161 | Moderate | Very High | 50% hospital vulnerability; Delta crisis |
| Louisiana | $154 | Moderate | High | Delta exposure; constrained |
| Minnesota | $151 | Moderate | Low | Low vulnerability offsets low funding |
| Wisconsin | $145 | Moderate | Moderate | Stable system; adequate |
| Mississippi | $129 | Severe | Very High | 54% hospital vulnerability |
| Kentucky | $114 | Moderate | High | Appalachian concentration |
| Missouri | $114 | Moderate | Moderate | Manageable constraints |

**Tier 4: Severely Constrained**
States where per-capita funding is insufficient relative to need; triage inevitable.

| State | Per-Capita | Medicaid Gap | Hospital Vulnerability | Assessment |
|-------|------------|--------------|----------------------|------------|
| Alabama | $97 | Severe | High | Non-expansion; Black Belt |
| California | $87 | Extreme | Moderate | Scale prevents adequacy |
| Tennessee | $86 | Severe | High | Non-expansion; Appalachia |
| Georgia | $75 | Severe | High | Partial expansion only |
| Ohio | $72 | Moderate | Moderate | Appalachian SE underserved |
| Texas | $65 | Extreme | Moderate | Largest rural population; least funded per person |
| North Carolina | $63 | Moderate | Moderate | Recent expansion; lowest per-capita |

## Part VI: Correlation Analysis

### RHTP Funding vs. Hospital Vulnerability

| Hospital Risk Category | Average Per-Capita | States |
|-----------------------|-------------------|--------|
| **Under 20% at risk** | $387 | AK, VT, ND, SD, WY, MT, HI, NH |
| **20-35% at risk** | $203 | NE, KS, IA, MN, WI, CO, OR, WA |
| **35-50% at risk** | $152 | MO, LA, KY, WV, OK, TX, NC |
| **Over 50% at risk** | $134 | MS, AR, KS, TN, AL, GA |

**Inverse relationship confirmed.** States with the highest hospital vulnerability receive the lowest per-capita funding. The formula creates a structural mismatch between resource allocation and demonstrated need.

### RHTP Funding vs. Health Outcomes

Mortality and morbidity data from **CDC WONDER** and **County Health Rankings**.

| Outcome Quintile | Average Per-Capita | Representative States |
|------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Best outcomes (Q1)** | $456 | MA, CT, NH, VT, CO, MN |
| **Second quintile** | $328 | WA, OR, IA, WI, NE |
| **Middle (Q3)** | $215 | KS, MO, MT, ID, UT |
| **Fourth quintile** | $142 | KY, TN, NC, SC, TX |
| **Worst outcomes (Q5)** | $108 | MS, AL, AR, LA, WV |

**The formula rewards states that need help least.** States with the worst rural health outcomes receive an average of $108 per rural resident, while states with the best outcomes receive $456, a 4.2x disparity.

### RHTP Funding vs. Persistent Poverty

Counties designated as **persistent poverty** (poverty rate above 20% for four consecutive Census periods) concentrate in specific states.

| Persistent Poverty Counties | States | Average Per-Capita |
|----------------------------|--------|-------------------|
| **Over 20** | TX, MS, AL, GA, KY, NM | $96 |
| **10 to 20** | LA, AR, NC, TN, SC | $131 |
| **5 to 10** | WV, OK, MO, VA | $174 |
| **Under 5** | Most other states | $298 |

**Persistent poverty concentration inversely correlates with per-capita RHTP funding.** States with the most entrenched rural poverty receive the least funding per rural resident.

### Regional Disparity Summary

| Region | Share of Awards | Average Per-Capita | Hospital Vulnerability |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Northeast** | 19% | $569 | Low |
| **South** | 30% | $133 | High |
| **Midwest** | 24% | $206 | Moderate |
| **West** | 27% | $354 | Low to Moderate |

**The South receives the most total funding but the least per rural resident despite having the highest hospital vulnerability rates.** This regional disparity reflects the formula's structural bias toward geographic factors over need-based metrics.

## Part VIII: Analytical Applications

### Using This Matrix in State Profiles

Each Series 3 state profile should document the following **Award Context Block**:

```
FY2026 Award: [Amount]
Five-Year Projection: [Amount]
Absolute Rank: [1-50]
Rural Population: [Count]
Per Rural Resident: [Amount]
Per-Capita Rank: [1-50]
Funding Tier: [Extreme High/High/Moderate/Low/Very Low]
Medicaid Gap Class: [Positive/Low/Moderate/Severe/Extreme]
```

### Metric Selection by Analytical Purpose

| If analyzing... | Primary metric | Secondary metrics |
|-----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Total state resources | Absolute award | Five-year projection |
| Individual resident impact | Per-capita | Funding tier |
| Facility-level resources | Per-CAH | Per-composite facility |
| Transformation capacity | Funding tier | Medicaid gap class |
| Need-funding mismatch | Per-capita vs. vulnerability | Per-capita vs. outcomes |
| Regional patterns | Regional totals | Regional per-capita |

### Cross-Reference Requirements

When citing this document in state profiles, include:

- State's absolute and per-capita ranking
- Funding tier classification
- Relevant regional comparison
- Hospital vulnerability context if applicable

## Methodology Notes

### Data Sources

**Primary Sources**
- CMS December 29, 2025 press release and state award table
- KFF analysis "First-Year Rural Health Fund Awards" (January 6, 2026)
- KFF pre-award analysis "State Awards From Most of the Rural Health Fund" (December 5, 2025)
- UNC Sheps Center rural population data
- Flex Monitoring Team CAH inventories

**Secondary Sources**
- U.S. Chamber of Commerce state award compilation
- Hall Render funding formula analysis (January 6, 2026)
- Chartis Rural Hospital Vulnerability Index (2025)
- Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform closure risk data
- State RHTP application materials

### Calculation Limitations

**Award data limitations:**
- FY2026 awards verified; subsequent years subject to recalculation
- Five-year projections assume constant allocation
- Technical score component changes annually

**Per-capita limitations:**
- Rural population definitions vary across sources
- CMS definition used for formula differs from Census Bureau
- State-level definitions may differ from federal classifications

**Facility data limitations:**
- CAH counts change with certifications and closures
- RHC and FQHC counts are estimates from multiple sources
- Composite facility metrics are approximations

**Correlation limitations:**
- Correlations are observational, not causal
- Multiple confounding factors affect observed relationships
- State-level aggregation masks within-state variation

### Update Schedule

This document requires revision when:
- CMS releases FY2027 or subsequent year awards
- Rural population estimates are updated
- New hospital vulnerability data becomes available
- Formula modifications occur through legislation or regulatory interpretation
- Significant changes in CAH or facility counts occur
