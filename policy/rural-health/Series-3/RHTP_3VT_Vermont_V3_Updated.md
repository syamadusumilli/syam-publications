# RHTP 3.VT: Vermont

*America's most rural state by percentage confronts the affordability paradox: nearly universal coverage and robust infrastructure coexist with the nation's highest premiums and nine of fourteen hospitals operating at a loss.*

## Introduction

Vermont's **$195 million FY2026 RHTP award** landed like an unexpected windfall. State officials anticipated approximately $100 million and received nearly double that amount, reflecting strong CMS scoring of an application that demonstrated both genuine need and implementation capacity. The award translates to approximately **$464 per rural resident**, placing Vermont among the top five states nationally for per capita funding.

The paradox animating Vermont's RHTP approach is distinctive. Unlike states battling Medicaid coverage gaps or catastrophic hospital closure waves, Vermont maintains **97% insurance coverage**, a robust network of FQHCs spanning all 14 counties, and no recent rural hospital closures. Yet **nine of its 14 hospitals operate at a loss**, healthcare costs have risen nearly 29% since 2023, and the state holds the dubious distinction of having the **highest insurance premiums in the nation**. The problem is not absence of coverage but unsustainability of the system providing it.

Vermont's RHTP strategy centers on **regionalization, shared services infrastructure, and primary care transformation** to address what a 2022 state law (Act 167) diagnosed as systemic dysfunction: high costs, workforce shortages, financial distress, and care delivery fragmented across too many independent providers competing in a market too small to sustain them all.

## Rural Health Landscape

Vermont spans **9,216 square miles** in northern New England, ranking as the nation's most rural state by percentage of population. The 2020 Census found that **65% of Vermonters live in rural areas**, with no towns exceeding 50,000 residents. Population density averages 70 people per square mile, roughly half the national average.

**Geographic Reality**

Of Vermont's **14 counties, only Chittenden County qualifies as non-rural** under federal definitions. This single county, home to Burlington and approximately one-quarter of the state's population, anchors healthcare infrastructure that the remaining 13 rural counties depend upon. The **Northeast Kingdom counties of Caledonia, Essex, and Orleans** represent Vermont's most isolated and underserved region, with higher unemployment, lower educational attainment, and longer drive times to care.

The state's current population is approximately **647,000**, with an aging demographic profile that compounds healthcare delivery challenges. Vermont is the **fourth oldest state by median age** (43.9 years versus the national median of 39.2), and one in four residents is over 60. The youth population has declined continuously since 2001, creating both workforce pipeline concerns and a dependency ratio that strains available resources.

**Healthcare Infrastructure**

| Facility Type | Count | Distribution |
|---------------|-------|--------------|
| General Hospitals | 14 | All nonprofit; 8 are CAHs |
| Critical Access Hospitals | 8 | Rural counties statewide |
| FQHCs | 11 | Operating ~60 primary care sites and ~17 dental sites across all 14 counties |
| Rural Health Clinics | 10 | 9 attached to CAHs |
| CCBHCs (current) | 2 | 5 additional planned for July 2026 certification |
| Veterans Affairs Hospital | 1 | White River Junction |

The **University of Vermont Medical Center (UVMMC)** dominates the state's healthcare market with approximately 50% market share. This concentration creates both efficiency advantages and access concerns: UVMMC operates as one of two Level 1 Trauma centers serving Vermont, much of western New Hampshire, and parts of northeastern New York. The second academic medical center is Dartmouth Health across the state border in New Hampshire.

All Vermont hospitals are **nonprofit entities**. The state has no rural emergency hospitals and has avoided the closure crisis affecting other rural states. However, this stability masks financial deterioration: projections suggest **13 of 14 hospitals will report operating losses by 2028** absent intervention.

**Workforce Shortages**

Vermont's healthcare workforce faces compounding challenges from aging demographics, limited educational pathways, and interstate competition.

The state predicts a **370 FTE primary care physician shortage by 2030**, including deficits of 112 in family medicine, 190 in internal medicine, 52 in OB-GYN, and 2 in pediatrics. Current workforce census data shows:

| Provider Category | Recent FTE Count | Trend |
|-------------------|------------------|-------|
| Primary Care Physicians | 406.3 (2022) | Declining |
| Registered Nurses | 4,203.3 (2023) | Declining |
| Licensed Nursing Assistants | 2,204.4 (2022) | Declining |
| Nurse Practitioners (Primary Care) | 323.5 (2023) | Stable/Increasing |
| Pharmacists | 489.3 (2023) | Stable |
| Social Workers | 860.8 (2024) | Increasing |

The **aging workforce** presents particular concern. Nearly half of Vermont's social workers are over 48 years old, and 27% are 60 or older. Similar patterns appear across provider categories. When baby boomers retire from healthcare positions, they simultaneously increase demand for healthcare services.

A **housing crisis** compounds workforce recruitment challenges. Vermont's rental vacancy rate of 3% is among the nation's lowest, and half of all renters are cost-burdened. Healthcare workers relocating to rural Vermont struggle to find housing, making recruitment incentives alone insufficient to address workforce gaps.

**Rural Service Deserts**

The **Northeast Kingdom** emerges consistently as Vermont's most underserved region:

| Indicator | Northeast Kingdom | State Average |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------|
| Uninsurance Rate | 6-8% | 3% |
| Drive Time to Urgent Care | Over 60 minutes (Essex County) | 20-30 minutes |
| Unemployment Rate | 3.6% (Essex County) | 2.5% |
| Disability Rates | Above state average | Varies by county |

Mapping of primary care practices by Rational Service Area shows differential access statewide. **Essex, Washington, and Windham Counties** have the fewest provider FTEs per 100,000 residents. A 2018 study found that while Chittenden County had a surplus of practitioners, Essex, Orleans, Caledonia, and Lamoille counties had no more than 2 to 5 primary care sites available to the public.

**Health Outcomes**

Vermont's health outcomes reflect the state's high insurance coverage but also reveal rural disparities.

| Measure | Rural Vermont | Comparison |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| Suicide Rate | 19 per 100,000 | National: 14.1 per 100,000 |
| Opioid-Related Deaths | Above national average | Ongoing crisis |
| Life Expectancy Gap | Rural counties 2-5 years lower | Compared to Chittenden County |
| Chronic Disease Burden | Higher in rural areas | Hypertension, COPD, diabetes |
| Obesity Rates | Higher in Northeast Kingdom, Rutland, Bennington | Above state average |

Rural Vermonters experience elevated rates of **chronic disease burden** including hypertension, COPD, and diabetes. Counties in the Northeast Kingdom report higher rates of adult obesity and tooth loss among older adults. Mental health and substance use challenges affect rural areas disproportionately, with elevated suicide rates, depression, and opioid-related adverse outcomes.

## RHTP Award and Context

**Award Details**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| FY2026 Allocation | $195,000,000 |
| Five-Year Projection | ~$975 million |
| Amount Expected | ~$100 million |
| Award vs. Expectation | Nearly 200% |
| Per Rural Resident | ~$464 |
| National Award Ranking | Mid-tier by absolute amount |
| Per Capita Ranking | Top 5 nationally |

Vermont's RHTP award represents approximately **98% of the requested first-year amount**, indicating strong CMS scoring. The state's application emphasized existing reform infrastructure, including the Blueprint for Health and AHEAD model participation, alongside concrete implementation plans with measurable milestones.

**Formula Advantage**

Vermont exemplifies the RHTP funding formula's advantage for small, highly rural states. With approximately **420,000 rural residents**, the $100 million baseline alone delivers roughly $238 per person before workload factors apply. The state's total award of ~$464 per rural resident is **nearly eight times Texas's allocation** of approximately $60 per rural resident.

This favorable position places Vermont among the states where **RHTP funding most closely approaches projected Medicaid cuts** under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, though the offset is imperfect and Vermont remains vulnerable to federal policy changes.

**Medicaid Context**

Vermont expanded Medicaid under the ACA and maintains among the highest coverage rates nationally. Approximately **19% of residents are enrolled in Medicaid** and 23% in Medicare. The state's **Dr. Dynasaur program** provides comprehensive coverage for children and pregnant women.

However, Vermont's Medicaid program faces structural pressures:

- **Enrollment declined approximately 8%** (12,000 beneficiaries) in FY2025 compared to FY2024 following the end of continuous coverage requirements
- **Provider reimbursement rates** remain below commercial rates, contributing to hospital financial distress
- **Medicare underpayment** compounds the problem, as Vermont's aging population increasingly relies on federal programs

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act's Medicaid provisions will require implementation of **new eligibility verification procedures** beginning in 2027. Vermont's Department of Health Access is preparing for these changes while emphasizing that most provisions will not take immediate effect.

## Strategic Approach

Vermont's RHTP application is organized around **five initiatives** addressing interconnected challenges:

**Program and Funding Distribution**

| Program | Estimated Allocation | Implementing Organization | Focus |
|---------|---------------------|--------------------------|-------|
| Regionalization & Innovative Care | $300 to $400M | GMCB/AHS/Hospital systems | Service consolidation, mobile units, strategic planning |
| Shared Services Infrastructure | $100 to $200M | VHIE/Hospital Association/Vendors TBD | EMR, HRIS, closed-loop referral, telemedicine |
| Primary Care Transformation | $200 to $300M | Blueprint for Health/FQHCs/Primary care practices | Team-based care, performance payments, data infrastructure |
| Workforce Development | $100 to $200M | Maple Mountain Consortium/VSU/UVM | Residency, training, housing, tuition assistance |
| Price Transparency | $10 to $50M | GMCB/AHS | Data platform, affordability analysis |
| **Five-Year Total** | **~$975M** | | |

*Note: Allocation ranges from Vermont RHTP application. Specific program budgets to be finalized through subaward process.*

The strategic framework reflects lessons from **Act 167**, which required analysis of Vermont's healthcare problems and generated consensus that regionalization of services was essential to sustainability.

**Initiative 1: Regionalization and Innovative Care Strategies**

The cornerstone of Vermont's approach addresses the fundamental tension between maintaining local access and achieving economies of scale in a state with 647,000 residents spread across 14 hospitals.

**Key Components:**
- **Transformation Support Grants** to providers for implementing regional care strategies
- **Transformation Analytics and Support** through hired vendor(s) for data modeling, efficiency studies, and project management
- **Facility Upgrades** for renovations enabling service realignment
- **Statewide Health Care Delivery Strategic Plan** development
- **Community Paramedicine and Mobile Integrated Health** model establishment
- **Mental Health and SUD Urgent Care Expansion** as ED alternatives
- **Mobile Units** for medical, dental, and integrated behavioral health services
- **High-Acuity Services for Nursing Homes** including dialysis units and ventilator capacity

The regionalization initiative will develop **hospital, regional, and statewide transformation plans** by June 2026, with implementation through 2030. Vermont envisions certain essential services available locally while other services concentrate in regional hubs or a single statewide location.

**Initiative 2: Establishing a Clinically Integrated Network of Shared Services**

Vermont's independent hospitals and providers lack the scale efficiencies of larger systems. This initiative creates **horizontal collaboration infrastructure** across the continuum of independent providers.

**Key Components:**
- **Shared EMR Platform** adoption incentives building on Vermont Health Information Exchange (VHIE)
- **Shared Human Resources Information System** for centralized functions across participating hospitals
- **Statewide e-Consult Expansion** ensuring interoperable specialist access for primary care
- **Closed-Loop Referral System** for care coordination across health and social services
- **Centralized Interfacility Transfer Tool** tracking bed capacity and service availability (modeled on Oregon's Capacity Center)
- **Remote Patient Monitoring Grants** to providers
- **Telehealth Technology Grants** to rural independent practices
- **AI Transcription and Scribe Technology Grants** to smaller practices

The shared EMR initiative acknowledges that Vermont's providers currently use multiple systems creating administrative burden and care coordination gaps. Participation would be voluntary but incentivized.

**Initiative 3: Strengthening Primary Care**

This initiative modernizes the **Blueprint for Health**, Vermont's existing community-led health improvement model, which originated in 2005 and has not been comprehensively updated.

**Key Components:**
- **Enhanced Team-Based Care Payments** (PMPM) supporting community health team staff
- **Access Incentive Payments** for practices meeting enhanced access requirements
- **Specialty and Primary Care Performance Payments** incentivizing coordination for diabetes, mental health/SUD, COPD, CHF, and hypertension
- **Mental Health and Community Support Integration** into primary care teams
- **Blueprint Transformation Network Enhancement** with technical assistance and training
- **Primary Care Data and Analytics Infrastructure** including eCQM tools, risk stratification, and referral tracking
- **FQHC Primary Care Expansion** through minor infrastructure renovations
- **Recovery Housing Grants** for individuals with SUD needs

The initiative targets specific conditions with measurable outcomes, including **controlling high blood pressure** (baseline 75.8%, target 78% or higher by budget period 5) and **glycemic control for diabetes** (baseline 21.8% poor control, target 21% or lower).

**Initiative 4: Health Care Workforce Development**

Vermont's workforce strategy addresses pipeline, retention, and scope of practice limitations.

**Training Programs:**
- **LNA Training Expansion** through hybrid education and coordinated clinical partnerships
- **Maple Mountain Consortium Family Medicine Residency** establishment (Vermont's first rural teaching health center residency, targeting 12 graduates annually)
- **Health Care Professions Residency Program Grants** supporting providers in identifying preceptors and recruiting residents

**Financial Assistance and Housing:**
- **Tuition Assistance Program** covering licensing fees, exam costs, continuing education, and intern stipends
- **Critical Occupations No-Cost Tuition Program** for high-demand professions including nursing, radiologic science, respiratory therapy, and dental hygiene
- **Conditional Financial Assistance Program** for students in critical fields with in-state service obligations
- **Workforce Housing Program** providing grants up to $50,000 per unit for renovations bringing vacant rentals to code

**Scope of Practice:**
- **Pharmacist Test-to-Treat Expansion** pilot program for COVID-19, flu, and strep throat
- **Community Paramedicine Scope Expansion** enabling triage and treatment without ED transport
- **CRNA Supervision Waiver** expansion

All workforce program participants must commit to **five-year in-state service agreements**, with explicit protections against non-compete clauses.

**Initiative 5: Price Transparency and Insurance Competition**

The smallest initiative addresses Vermont's affordability crisis through data infrastructure and policy analysis.

**Key Components:**
- **Statewide Health Care Data Platform Modernization** replacing older tools with modern dashboards tracking cost, quality, and access metrics
- **Statewide Assessment of Coverage Affordability Options** exploring reinsurance, Basic Health Plan, and marketplace sustainability strategies

Vermont has the **highest insurance premiums in the nation**. Average monthly individual market premiums increased from $675 in 2022 to $1,049 in 2025 (55% increase). This initiative funds analysis to inform 2028 policy changes.

## Social Care Integration

Vermont's RHTP application includes substantial social care components distributed across initiatives rather than concentrated in a single program.

**SDOH and HRSN Initiatives**

The **closed-loop referral system** (Initiative 2) represents Vermont's primary SDOH infrastructure investment. The platform will enable real-time data sharing and tracking of referral outcomes across health and social services, including housing, food assistance, and transportation.

Vermont's approach integrates SDOH screening into the **modernized Blueprint for Health** model (Initiative 3), embedding community support specialists within primary care teams to strengthen coordination between physical health, mental health, and social services.

**Community Health Worker Programs**

CHW deployment is embedded within Initiative 3's community health team enhancement rather than structured as a standalone workforce program. The Blueprint model includes care coordinators and community support staff who perform CHW-equivalent functions, though Vermont does not use a separate CHW certification structure.

**Recovery Housing Grants** (Initiative 3) explicitly connect primary care transformation to housing stability for individuals with SUD, recognizing that clinical treatment cannot succeed without addressing social determinants.

**CIE Platform Implementation**

The **closed-loop referral system** (Initiative 2) functions as Vermont's Community Information Exchange investment. The state will purchase a digital care coordination platform to strengthen communication among healthcare, mental health/SUD, and social service providers.

Key features include:
- Real-time data sharing
- Referral outcome tracking
- Confirmation of service receipt
- Feedback to referring providers

The platform explicitly aims to reduce duplication, improve accountability, and promote cost efficiency while ensuring person-centered care.

**Technology Vendor Landscape**

Vermont's application does not name specific CIE vendors, indicating procurement will be required. The state's existing **Vermont Health Information Exchange (VHIE)** provides foundational data infrastructure that any CIE platform must complement. Current SDOH/CIE technology presence in Vermont appears limited, creating opportunity for new entrants.

**Social Care Integration Summary**

| Component | Included in Plan | Estimated Funding | Vendor/Operator | Likely Funded? |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| SDOH Screening | Yes (within Blueprint) | Embedded in Initiative 3 | Primary care practices | Yes |
| HRSN Navigation | Yes | $15 to $25M estimated | Community health teams | Yes |
| CHW Programs | Yes (as community support specialists) | Embedded in Initiative 3 | Blueprint for Health | Yes |
| CIE Platform | Yes (closed-loop referral) | $20 to $40M estimated | Vendor TBD (procurement required) | Yes |

Vermont's social care strategy integrates SDOH coordination into clinical transformation initiatives rather than funding standalone social care programs. The closed-loop referral system represents explicit CIE investment. Community support specialists within Blueprint teams perform CHW-equivalent functions. Recovery housing grants (Initiative 3) directly address housing stability as social determinant.

**Social Care Survival Assessment:** Vermont's social care components show strong survival prospects due to:
- Integration with Blueprint for Health model that has established sustainability
- AHEAD model participation providing potential ongoing reimbursement pathway
- Explicit CIE platform procurement with operational infrastructure
- Community health team enhancement building on existing paid workforce

- **Green Mountain Care Board**: Healthcare regulatory oversight and AHEAD model implementation

## Assessment

**Strengths**

**Formula Advantage Creates Investment Capacity**. Vermont's **~$464 per rural resident** represents substantial resources relative to population. Unlike Texas or North Carolina where per-capita constraints force triage, Vermont can pursue comprehensive transformation across all five initiatives if implementation executes effectively.

**Near-Universal Coverage Foundation**. The state's **97% insurance coverage** means RHTP investments build on a covered population rather than attempting to extend care to uninsured residents. Transformation initiatives can focus on care delivery improvement rather than coverage expansion.

**Existing Reform Infrastructure**. Vermont brings **Blueprint for Health**, the All-Payer Model experience, and now **AHEAD model participation** to RHTP implementation. The state has institutional memory of healthcare transformation attempts, including lessons from initiatives that underperformed. This experience should inform realistic planning.

**Hospital Network Stability**. Vermont has avoided rural hospital closures despite financial distress. The eight Critical Access Hospitals and six other facilities remain operational, providing a foundation for regionalization rather than emergency stabilization.

**AHEAD Model Alignment**. Vermont's RHTP strategy explicitly leverages **AHEAD model participation** (beginning 2027 or 2028) as a sustainability mechanism. Hospital global budgets and primary care enhancement payments under AHEAD could perpetuate RHTP investments after federal transformation funding expires.

**Small State Coordination Advantage**. With only 14 hospitals, 11 FQHCs, and a concentrated stakeholder community, Vermont can achieve coordination that larger states cannot. Decision-makers know each other, governance structures are established, and statewide implementation is logistically feasible.

**Vulnerabilities**

**Affordability Crisis Persists**. RHTP funding cannot directly address Vermont's **highest-in-nation insurance premiums**. The $10-50 million price transparency initiative funds analysis and data infrastructure, not premium subsidies or reinsurance. Even successful transformation may not reduce costs quickly enough to prevent coverage erosion if federal premium tax credits expire.

**Hospital Financial Deterioration**. Nine of 14 hospitals currently operate at a loss, with projections suggesting **13 of 14 will show losses by 2028**. RHTP regionalization funding may help some facilities, but the structural economics of operating small hospitals in a small state remain challenging regardless of transformation investments.

**AHEAD Model Uncertainty**. Vermont's sustainability strategy depends heavily on AHEAD model implementation beginning in 2027 or 2028. The model has already been modified by CMS, and state participation involves **total cost of care accountability** and hospital global budgets that create implementation risk. If AHEAD underperforms or is terminated, RHTP investments lose their primary sustainability pathway.

**Workforce Housing Crisis**. The **$50,000 per unit housing grant program** addresses symptoms but cannot resolve Vermont's 3% rental vacancy rate and housing shortage. Workforce recruitment may remain constrained regardless of training pipeline investments.

**Implementation Capacity Constraints**. Vermont's application acknowledges that the Green Mountain Care Board requires **five additional staff by September 2026 and 20 by mid-2026** to implement AHEAD. State agencies may face similar capacity constraints for RHTP implementation, particularly given compressed timelines for the two-year obligation requirement.

**Northeast Kingdom Access Gap Persistence**. The geographic access challenges in Essex, Orleans, and Caledonia counties reflect decades of population patterns and economic conditions that RHTP investments cannot fundamentally alter. Telemedicine and mobile units provide partial solutions, but physical distance from specialty care will persist.

**Sustainability Prospects**

Vermont's sustainability framework is more developed than most states, built on multiple reinforcing mechanisms:

1. **AHEAD Model Integration**: Hospital global budgets and primary care payments could perpetuate transformed care delivery models
2. **Payer Engagement**: Blueprint for Health modernization explicitly includes commercial payer participation beyond Medicare and Medicaid
3. **One-Time Investment Structure**: Many RHTP-funded activities (facility upgrades, technology procurement, strategic planning) are capital investments rather than recurring operational expenses
4. **Subscription and Cost-Sharing Models**: Shared services infrastructure designed to operate on provider-funded subscription models after establishment

However, sustainability depends on:
- AHEAD model remaining operational and meeting state needs
- Commercial payers continuing Blueprint participation
- Provider organizations generating sufficient margin to support subscription costs
- State general fund commitment for programs lacking payer reimbursement

Vermont's conservative fiscal philosophy limits expectations for major state general fund appropriations. The state has historically relied on federal programs to fund healthcare transformation, a pattern RHTP continues.

**Critical Success Factors**

1. **Regionalization plan completion and acceptance**: Whether hospitals and communities support service consolidation and centers of excellence
2. **AHEAD model implementation velocity**: Coordinating RHTP initiatives with global budget implementation timeline
3. **Shared services adoption rates**: Whether independent providers participate voluntarily in shared EMR, HRIS, and other infrastructure
4. **Workforce housing program effectiveness**: Converting housing grants into actual workforce retention
5. **CCBHC certification achievement**: Successfully certifying five additional CCBHCs by July 2026
6. **Premium affordability resolution**: State policy decisions on reinsurance, Basic Health Plan, or other affordability mechanisms by 2028

## Conclusion

Vermont enters RHTP implementation with **structural advantages unavailable to most states**: favorable per-capita funding, near-universal coverage, stable hospital network, existing reform infrastructure, and AHEAD model participation providing a sustainability pathway. The state's application demonstrates sophisticated understanding of its healthcare challenges and proposes reasonable interventions across regionalization, shared services, primary care, workforce, and affordability.

The **central question is not whether Vermont has adequate resources** but whether the state can execute coordinated transformation across multiple complex initiatives within compressed timelines while simultaneously implementing AHEAD model requirements. Vermont's healthcare challenges are genuine: highest premiums nationally, 9 of 14 hospitals losing money, aging workforce, and housing shortages constraining recruitment. RHTP provides substantial resources to address these challenges, but the window for impact is narrow.

**What to Watch**

- Q1-Q2 2026 subaward announcements showing initiative priorities and geographic distribution
- Regionalization strategic plan development and hospital participation
- CCBHC certification progress toward July 2026 deadline for five additional sites
- AHEAD model implementation timeline and coordination with RHTP initiatives
- Workforce housing program launch and unit production
- Premium affordability analysis completion and policy recommendations
- Closed-loop referral system vendor selection and procurement timeline

Vermont's RHTP implementation tests whether a small, highly rural state with existing reform infrastructure can leverage favorable funding to achieve systemic transformation rather than incremental improvement. The state's trajectory will reveal whether coordination advantages in a small state translate to implementation effectiveness or whether complexity overwhelms capacity regardless of scale.
