# RHTP 3.NM: New Mexico

*A Medicaid expansion state where Project ECHO pioneered specialty care extension to rural providers, New Mexico's $211.5 million RHTP award funds five interconnected initiatives across 33 counties as the state confronts the contradiction of federal transformation investment arriving alongside Medicaid cuts that could close six to eight rural hospitals within 18 months.*

## Introduction

New Mexico's **$211,484,741 FY2026 RHTP award** ranks 13th highest nationally, exceeding the $200 million state average and slightly surpassing the state's per annum request from its $1 billion five-year application. The allocation translates to approximately **$303 per rural resident** using the 698,000 non-metropolitan population figure, positioning New Mexico favorably compared to larger states with proportionally smaller per capita awards.

The central tension shaping New Mexico's rural health transformation involves **scale without density**. The state ranks fifth largest geographically while maintaining one of the smallest populations, creating vast distances separating sparse communities from limited healthcare infrastructure. Fifty percent of New Mexicans live in just three counties comprising only 6% of state land area. The remaining half spreads across territory larger than most Eastern states combined.

New Mexico expanded Medicaid in 2014, and the program now enrolls approximately **836,000 New Mexicans**, nearly 40% of the state population. This coverage foundation stabilized rural hospitals and enabled the care delivery infrastructure that RHTP investments will augment. But the **One Big Beautiful Bill Act** threatens to reverse those gains. The New Mexico Health Care Authority estimates federal Medicaid cuts could result in a loss of **$8.5 billion** in federal funds from 2028 through 2037. Six to eight hospitals face closure risk within 18 months if cuts proceed as structured.

The state's application centers on five interconnected initiatives building toward what officials describe as transformation of rural health delivery across all 33 counties. Whether that ambition survives contact with implementation constraints and Medicaid erosion remains the central question.

## Rural Health Landscape

**Geographic Context**

New Mexico spans **121,298 square miles** of high desert, mountain ranges, and vast open terrain. The state's **33 counties** present dramatically different health environments, from the Rio Grande corridor containing Albuquerque and Santa Fe to the isolated frontier communities of the eastern plains and western mountains.

About **698,000 New Mexicans** live in non-metropolitan areas, roughly one-third of the state population. Population density averages **17 persons per square mile** compared to the national average of 87. Approximately 10% of residents live in **Frontier and Remote areas**, designated as more than 60 minutes from urban centers of 25,000 or more.

Two-thirds of New Mexico's counties experienced population decline between 2010 and 2020. The growth that occurred concentrated entirely in residents aged 65 and over. Young people continue leaving rural communities for metropolitan opportunities in Albuquerque, Santa Fe, and beyond.

**Demographic Complexity**

Over **60% of residents** identify as Hispanic, American Indian, Alaska Native, or another non-white racial group. The Hispanic population includes both deeply rooted families and recent immigrants, with many families containing members of mixed documentation status.

The state recognizes **23 federally recognized tribes** including 20 Pueblos, two Apache bands, and three chapters of the Navajo Nation. In three counties, Native American residents exceed one-third of the population. These sovereign nations maintain distinct health systems operating through Indian Health Service, tribally operated facilities under P.L. 93-638, and urban Indian health programs.

**Healthcare Infrastructure**

| Facility Type | Count | Notes |
|---------------|-------|-------|
| Critical Access Hospitals | 13 | 25-bed rural facilities with cost-based Medicare reimbursement |
| Rural Emergency Hospitals | 1 | State's first REH designated in 2024 |
| Rural Health Clinics | 21 | Primary care in underserved areas |
| FQHCs (all sites) | 114 | Federally Qualified Health Center locations |
| Total State Hospitals | 47 | All acute care facilities |

New Mexico's **13 Critical Access Hospitals** anchor isolated communities across the state. Examples include Lincoln County Medical Center in Ruidoso, Dr. Dan C. Trigg Memorial Hospital in Tucumcari, Socorro General Hospital, and Presbyterian EspaÃ±ola Hospital. These facilities face standard CAH constraints: 25-bed limits, average length of stay requirements, and cost-based Medicare reimbursement.

**Tribal Health Infrastructure**

The Indian Health Service **Albuquerque Area** serves 27 distinct tribal groups across four Southwest states. Within New Mexico, IHS operates **5 hospitals** including Northern Navajo Medical Center in Shiprock (60 beds), Gallup Indian Medical Center (99 beds), Santa Fe Indian Hospital, and facilities serving the Mescalero Apache and Jicarilla Apache. An additional **11 health centers** and **12 field clinics** distribute across pueblos and tribal communities.

Tribal health facilities operate under distinct federal frameworks. Direct IHS facilities, tribally operated 638 programs, and urban Indian health centers in Albuquerque serve populations experiencing health disparities exceeding those of non-tribal rural residents.

**Workforce Shortages**

New Mexico's workforce crisis pervades every county and nearly every specialty. **30 of 33 counties** carry Health Professional Shortage Area designations. Only 10% of physicians practice in rural areas despite a significant portion of the population living in rural communities.

| Shortage Category | Scope | Notes |
|-------------------|-------|-------|
| Primary Care HPSAs | 30 of 33 counties | Widespread shortage |
| Mental Health HPSAs | Statewide | Severe shortage |
| Dental HPSAs | Majority of counties | Limited access |
| OB/GYN Coverage | 8 counties without surgical delivery | Maternal health gap |

The state documents severe specialist shortages projected to worsen through 2030. Supply-to-demand ratios indicate inadequate specialist capacity across cardiology, psychiatry, OB/GYN, and most other specialties.

**Health Outcomes**

Rural New Mexico exhibits consistently worse health outcomes than metropolitan areas:

| Indicator | Rural New Mexico | Comparison |
|-----------|-----------------|------------|
| Life Expectancy | 76.7 years | 2.5 years shorter than metro (79.2) |
| Diabetes Prevalence | 11.2% | 2.3x higher among Native American populations |
| Suicide Rate | 4th highest nationally | 3.5x higher among men |
| Alcohol-Related Mortality | 32.0 per 100,000 | Exceeds state average of 25.6 |
| YPLL (before age 75) | 8,778 per 100,000 | Substantially above national 6,716 |

These disparities concentrate in communities with the least healthcare infrastructure and highest poverty rates. New Mexico maintains one of the highest poverty rates nationally at **18.4%** compared to 12.8% nationally. McKinley County recorded the highest poverty rate at 35.2%.

## RHTP Award and Context

**Award Details**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| FY2026 Allocation | $211,484,741 |
| Five-Year Request | $1 billion |
| National Ranking | 13th highest |
| Per Rural Resident | ~$303 annually |
| Baseline Funding | $100 million |
| Workload Funding | $111.5 million |

New Mexico received approximately **$111.5 million in workload funding** atop the $100 million baseline allocation, reflecting competitive scoring on rural factors and initiative quality. The award positions New Mexico to launch its five initiatives at approximately requested scale.

**Medicaid Context**

New Mexico expanded Medicaid in 2014 under then-Governor Susana Martinez, making her only the second Republican governor to accept expansion at that time. The program, renamed **Centennial Care**, now enrolls approximately **836,000 New Mexicans**, nearly 40% of the state population.

| Medicaid Metric | Value | Significance |
|-----------------|-------|--------------|
| Total Enrollment | 836,000 | 40% of state population |
| Non-Elderly Adult Rate | 31.6% | Third highest nationally |
| Rural Enrollee Share | 37% | Medicaid enrollees in non-metro areas |
| Children on Medicaid/CHIP | 50%+ | Rural areas |
| Hospitals in Top 10% Medicaid Share | 15 | Nationally ranked |
| Projected Federal Losses | $8.5 billion | 2028 through 2037 |

Medicaid dependence runs exceptionally high in rural New Mexico, creating acute vulnerability. Six to eight hospitals face closure risk within 18 months if Medicaid cuts proceed as currently structured.

**Project ECHO Integration**

New Mexico houses one of rural healthcare's most successful innovation models. **Project ECHO** (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes), developed at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, uses telehealth technology to connect primary care providers in rural and underserved areas with specialists at academic medical centers.

Unlike traditional telehealth connecting patients with doctors, Project ECHO focuses on **training and mentoring** rural clinicians. Weekly video sessions allow rural providers to present cases, receive guidance, and build capacity to manage complex conditions locally. The model has expanded globally but remains anchored at UNM, where it now offers more than 74 free professional development programs.

Project ECHO's integration into the RHTP application represents strategic leverage of existing infrastructure that other states must construct from scratch.

## State Approach

**Lead Agency and Governance**

The **New Mexico Health Care Authority (HCA)** serves as lead agency, coordinating RHTP implementation across state agencies including the Department of Health. HCA submitted the state's application on November 4, 2025, following extensive stakeholder engagement including a tribal leaders listening session, public forums, and a Request for Information process that gathered project concepts from communities statewide.

Secretary Kari Armijo leads implementation, noting that the funding "recognizes New Mexico's bold plan to transform rural health care delivery across all 33 counties."

**Strategic Framework**

New Mexico's application proposes **five interconnected initiatives** designed to address distinct but related challenges:

1. **Healthy Horizons**: Specialty care and chronic disease management expansion
2. **Rooted in New Mexico**: Workforce recruitment, training, and retention
3. **Rural Health Sustainability and Innovation Center (RHSIC)**: Centralized operational support
4. **Rural Health Innovation Fund**: Community-directed health improvement grants
5. **Rural Health Data Hub**: Statewide health analytics platform

The initiatives build on existing infrastructure, particularly Project ECHO's tele-mentoring capacity and the state's established community health worker programs.

## Program and Funding Distribution

| Initiative | Proposed Allocation | Focus | Primary Organization |
|------------|---------------------|-------|---------------------|
| Healthy Horizons | $393 million (5-year) | Specialty care, chronic disease, telehealth | UNM Health Sciences Center, regional providers |
| Rooted in New Mexico | $243 million (5-year) | Workforce pipeline, loan repayment, ECHO training | UNM, NMHA, community colleges |
| RHSIC | $123 million (5-year) | Technical assistance, program governance | HCA, contracted consultants |
| Rural Health Innovation Fund | $188 million (5-year) | Community grants, tribal initiatives | HCA, local health councils |
| Rural Health Data Hub | $53 million (5-year) | Analytics platform, HIE expansion | HCA, technology vendors |

**Initiative Details**

**Healthy Horizons** ($393 million proposed) expands specialty care and chronic disease management through regional specialty and maternal care networks, e-Consults and provider-to-provider virtual consultations, remote patient monitoring for chronic conditions, and telehealth platforms deployed in clinics, schools, senior centers, and libraries. The initiative targets 15% increase in timely virtual consults and 5% reduction in hospital readmissions.

**Rooted in New Mexico** ($243 million proposed) addresses workforce through loan repayment and scholarship expansion, residency and fellowship training program support, ECHO-model tele-mentoring for rural clinicians, community health worker and peer support workforce development, direct care worker pipeline programs, culturally responsive training for tribal community care, school nurse hiring, and provider burnout mitigation through team-based models. The initiative aims to reduce HPSA designations by 5% to 10%.

**RHSIC** ($123 million proposed) serves as the central operational hub coordinating all RHTP activities, providing program governance, subaward administration, technical assistance to rural providers, performance monitoring, hands-on operational support for rural hospitals, financial sustainability planning, and vendor management. The Center recognizes that rural hospital leaders often fill multiple roles and may lack specialized expertise in revenue cycle management, quality improvement, or strategic planning.

**Rural Health Innovation Fund** ($188 million proposed) provides competitive grants allowing rural, frontier, and tribal communities to design initiatives addressing local health challenges. This bottom-up component complements the top-down structure of other initiatives, recognizing that communities understand their own needs better than state agencies can prescribe.

**Rural Health Data Hub** ($53 million proposed) builds a statewide health analytics platform integrating currently siloed data sources, including data pipeline development, performance dashboards, predictive analytics, and Health Information Exchange participation expansion targeting 30% increase.

## Social Care Integration

New Mexico's RHTP application integrates social care components primarily through the **Rooted in New Mexico** workforce initiative and the **Rural Health Innovation Fund**, with community health worker development as a named activity.

| Component | Included in Plan | Estimated Funding | Lead Organization | Likely Funded |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| SDOH Screening | Yes (embedded) | Not separately itemized | Provider partners | At Risk |
| HRSN Navigation | Yes (embedded) | Within Healthy Horizons | Regional networks | At Risk |
| CHW Deployment | Yes | Within workforce initiative | UNM CHWI, NM DOH OCHW | Yes |
| CIE Platform | Partial | Within Data Hub | HCA, pending procurement | At Risk |

**Community Health Worker Infrastructure**

New Mexico has established CHW infrastructure that predates RHTP. The **New Mexico Department of Health Office of Community Health Workers (OCHW)**, established in 2008, developed a standardized statewide training program and certification process. The **UNM Office for Community Health's Community Health Worker Initiatives Unit**, created in 2014, designs and evaluates projects utilizing CHWs to address social determinants of health.

The **Rooted in New Mexico** workforce initiative includes CHW and peer support workforce development, building on this existing infrastructure. Medicaid coverage for CHW services through managed care organizations provides a sustainability mechanism that could outlast RHTP funding.

**SDOH Collaborative Alignment**

The **New Mexico Social Drivers of Health Collaborative (NMSDOH-C)** coordinates stakeholders to address SDOH in communities and health-related social needs of individuals. The collaborative leads development of community-driven, coordinated, closed-loop health and social service referral systems. RHTP investments align with but do not duplicate this existing coordination infrastructure.

**Technology Landscape**

New Mexico lacks a statewide CIE platform comparable to systems in some other states. The **Rural Health Data Hub** component of RHTP includes HIE expansion but does not specify closed-loop social service referral technology. Procurement for any CIE platform would follow RHTP award implementation. **Findhelp** (formerly Aunt Bertha) and **Unite Us** both maintain New Mexico presence but are not named in the state application.

## Key Subawardees

Based on application design and existing infrastructure, anticipated key subawardees include:

| Organization | Type | Anticipated Role |
|--------------|------|------------------|
| University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center | Academic Partner | Project ECHO hub, workforce training, telehealth platform |
| New Mexico Hospital Association | Intermediary | Technical assistance coordination, hospital support |
| New Mexico Primary Care Association | Intermediary | FQHC coordination, workforce pipeline |
| New Mexico Rural Hospital Network | Provider Network | CAH coordination, peer networking |
| NM Department of Health OCHW | State Agency | CHW training and certification |
| UNM Office for Community Health CHWI | Academic Partner | CHW program implementation |
| Local Health Councils (33 counties) | Community Partners | Innovation Fund grant recipients |
| Tribal Health Departments | Sovereign Partners | Tribal-specific initiatives |

Formal subaward announcements pending state procurement and contracting processes. The application notes HCA released an RFP for consultant support for RHTP application development, suggesting contracted technical assistance continues through implementation.

## Assessment

**Strengths**

**Project ECHO integration** represents New Mexico's strongest strategic advantage. The state houses a proven, nationally recognized model for extending specialist expertise to rural providers. Building RHTP workforce initiatives on this existing platform provides immediate implementation capacity.

**Medicaid expansion foundation** provides coverage for 40% of state residents, stabilizing rural provider revenue and enabling the care delivery infrastructure RHTP investments will augment. The state's managed care organizations have experience integrating CHW services.

**Established CHW infrastructure** through NM DOH and UNM provides training, certification, and deployment capacity that other states must build from scratch. This workforce category has demonstrated effectiveness in addressing social determinants of health among New Mexico's underserved populations.

**Community-directed funding** through the Rural Health Innovation Fund recognizes that 33 diverse counties require different approaches. The mechanism creates space for local solutions rather than imposing uniform prescriptions.

**RHSIC technical assistance model** addresses a real gap. Small rural facilities cannot individually afford specialized expertise in operations, quality improvement, and financial management. Shared infrastructure delivers value across multiple facilities simultaneously.

**Vulnerabilities**

**Tribal health coordination** faces sovereignty complexities. IHS facilities, 638 programs, and state-administered RHTP initiatives operate under different frameworks with different accountability structures. The application's language about culturally responsive training and tribal residency tracks acknowledges the issue without fully resolving how coordination occurs in practice.

**Data Hub implementation** faces hurdles beyond funding. Integrating siloed data sources requires organizational cooperation, technical standardization, and cultural change across dozens of independent providers. A 30% increase in HIE participation is achievable but requires sustained effort beyond purchasing software.

**Specialty care expansion through telehealth** assumes providers exist at hub sites to conduct consultations. Specialist shortages at UNM and other academic centers limit the volume of virtual consultations rural sites can access, regardless of connectivity.

**Social care components lack dedicated funding streams**. SDOH screening and HRSN navigation embed within other initiatives without separate line items, making them vulnerable to trimming when budgets tighten.

**Sustainability Prospects**

**Durable investments**:
- Workforce trained through pipeline programs continues practicing
- Project ECHO infrastructure persists with modest ongoing investment
- CHW certification and training capacity remains
- Data infrastructure operates with ongoing but reduced investment
- Interstate licensure changes, if enacted, remain permanent policy

**Vulnerable components**:
- Community innovation grants for projects without revenue models
- Direct operational subsidies to struggling facilities
- Expanded positions at RHSIC and state agencies
- Technical assistance programs dependent on federal support
- School nurse hiring without state education budget commitment

**The 2030 Question**

New Mexico faces a **timing collision**. RHTP funding ends in 2030 precisely when Medicaid cuts reach maximum impact. The state receives approximately $1 billion over five years to transform rural health while simultaneously losing $8.5 billion over ten years in Medicaid funding.

Julia Ruetten of the New Mexico Hospital Association observed that the programs "kind of end at the same time that the biggest impacts to the Medicaid cuts for hospitals are going to go into effect. I do have concern that it's setting up a future cliff."

The critical variable remains Medicaid. If enhanced federal matching holds and coverage remains stable, RHTP investments improve care delivery for insured patients. If Medicaid erodes through work requirements, eligibility restrictions, or reduced federal matching, RHTP investments become infrastructure for populations increasingly unable to access the care that infrastructure provides.

**The Medicaid Math**

New Mexico's rural health system depends on Medicaid to an extent that dwarfs RHTP considerations:

- **40% of state population** enrolled in Medicaid
- **37% of Medicaid enrollees** live in rural areas
- **31.6% of non-elderly adults** rely on Medicaid (third highest nationally)
- **15 hospitals** rank in top 10% nationally for Medicaid patient share
- **30% of hospital revenue** derives from Medicaid at many facilities
- **6 to 8 hospitals** face closure risk from pending cuts

RHTP invests approximately $40 million annually per initiative. Medicaid provides billions. The arithmetic is not close.

## Conclusion

New Mexico's $211.5 million RHTP award lands in **fertile ground**. The state houses Project ECHO, maintains strong Medicaid infrastructure, established community health worker programs, and designed initiatives building on existing capacity. Implementation through HCA leverages existing relationships with providers and tribes.

The approach itself is sound: specialty care extension through proven telehealth models, workforce development with training pipelines, community-directed grants for local priorities, and technical assistance for struggling rural facilities. These investments address documented needs with tested strategies.

But New Mexico faces the same **structural contradiction** confronting every RHTP recipient: federal transformation funding arrives alongside federal Medicaid cuts that threaten to eliminate the gains transformation might achieve. The $8.5 billion in projected Medicaid losses over a decade dwarfs the approximately $1 billion in RHTP investment.

**What to watch**: Whether Project ECHO expansion delivers measurable improvements in rural chronic disease management. Whether the workforce pipeline produces providers who actually practice in rural communities beyond their five-year commitment periods. Whether the Innovation Fund generates sustainable local solutions or one-time projects. Whether tribal health coordination navigates sovereignty complexities to produce integrated care. Most importantly, whether any of it matters if Medicaid cuts proceed and six to eight rural hospitals close.

For the 698,000 New Mexicans living in rural areas, the question is not whether the state has good ideas with strong implementation capacity. It does. The question is whether transformation investment can outrun coverage erosion, and whether the infrastructure being built will serve populations who can still access the care that infrastructure provides.
