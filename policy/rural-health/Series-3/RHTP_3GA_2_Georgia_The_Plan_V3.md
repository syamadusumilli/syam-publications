# RHTP 3.GA.2: Georgia, The Plan

## GREAT Health: Technology and Resilience at Scale

*Series 3: State Implementation*

## Introduction

Part 1 established the baseline: **$218.8 million for 2.9 million rural Georgians** translates to approximately $75 per person annually, positioning Georgia in the middle tier of per capita allocations. Eighteen of thirty rural hospitals face closure risk. Eleven have already closed. The state's partial Medicaid expansion through Georgia Pathways covers only a fraction of the 175,000 residents trapped in the coverage gap. These are the conditions the Georgia Department of Community Health must transform with resources that fund demonstration projects rather than systemic change.

Georgia responded with **"Georgia Rural Enhancement And Transformation of Health" (GREAT Health)**, a multi-initiative strategy emphasizing disaster resilience, technology deployment, and workforce stabilization. The 96-page application requested approximately $1.4 billion over five years. It received roughly 16 percent of that request in the first year. This article examines what Georgia proposes to do with what it received.

The strategic approach reflects Georgia's unique vulnerabilities. The state sits in hurricane and severe weather corridors. Southwest Georgia and the Black Belt suffer from some of the worst health outcomes in the nation. Governor Brian Kemp, who hails from Wilcox County in the Black Belt, brought personal familiarity with rural healthcare challenges to the application development process. **Commissioner Dr. Dean Burke** leads DCH implementation with a 96-page blueprint that prioritizes infrastructure resilience over social care integration.

**The central premise**: technology deployment and disaster preparedness can stabilize rural healthcare infrastructure while longer-term workforce and coverage challenges require solutions beyond RHTP scope. Whether this premise holds will determine if Georgia's 2.9 million rural residents see meaningful healthcare improvement or merely fortified facilities that continue struggling to serve them.

## The Strategic Framework

### Governance Structure

The **Georgia Department of Community Health (DCH)** serves as lead agency for all RHTP implementation. Commissioner Dr. Dean Burke bears statutory responsibility for program administration, reporting, and compliance with CMS cooperative agreement requirements. DCH manages both Medicaid and public health functions, consolidating authority over RHTP activities under one agency.

Georgia's application process demonstrated **unusual stakeholder engagement**. From August 11 through 29, 2025, DCH accepted public input through an online portal, receiving over 350 submissions. DCH subsequently hosted four town hall meetings in Cordele, Jasper, Vidalia, and virtually to gather additional input. This engagement process shaped initiative priorities, with technology solutions emerging as the dominant theme across stakeholder submissions.

| Role | Function |
|------|----------|
| Commissioner (Dr. Dean Burke) | Ultimate accountability, policy direction |
| GREAT Health Program Director | Day-to-day management, CMS liaison |
| Initiative Coordinators | Subject-matter leads for each initiative area |
| Grants Management | Subaward administration, compliance |
| Data and Evaluation | Performance monitoring, reporting |
| Regional Coordinators | Stakeholder engagement across health districts |

The governance structure **centralizes control at the state level** while leveraging existing regional health district infrastructure. Georgia's 18 health districts provide natural organizational units for implementation coordination, though funding flows through DCH rather than through districts as autonomous grantmakers.

### Theory of Change

The Georgia application operates on an **infrastructure-first, resilience-oriented theory of change**. The logic model:

1. **Resilient infrastructure enables stable care delivery.** Hospitals that cannot shelter in place during disasters cannot serve communities when they most need care. Physical infrastructure investment creates the foundation for all other transformation.

2. **Technology extends capacity where providers cannot reach.** Rural Georgia lacks sufficient healthcare workforce to staff traditional care models. Telehealth pods and satellite connectivity bring specialists to communities that cannot attract them permanently.

3. **Laboratory and diagnostic capacity prevents transfers.** Expanded newborn screening and regional diagnostic capacity reduce emergency transfers that strain both families and receiving hospitals.

4. **Cybersecurity protects vulnerable systems.** Rural hospitals increasingly face ransomware and cyberattacks. Security investment prevents catastrophic operational failures.

5. **Workforce recruitment addresses chronic shortages.** Nurse recruitment funding and training investments begin building the workforce pipeline, though results extend beyond RHTP timelines.

The theory's vulnerabilities include coverage gaps that prevent transformed systems from serving patients who cannot afford care, the **Georgia Pathways enrollment failure** that leaves most potentially eligible adults uninsured, and timeline pressures that favor demonstrable infrastructure over systemic transformation.

### Core Initiatives and Interrelationships

Georgia's GREAT Health initiatives form a layered system prioritizing infrastructure resilience:

**Resilience Layer**: Disaster preparedness dominates the application, with $175 million proposed for shelter-in-place capacity enhancement at rural hospitals. This reflects Georgia's geographic reality and recent experiences with hurricane-related healthcare disruptions.

**Technology Layer**: Telehealth pods, Starlink satellite connectivity, electronic health record modernization, and AI-assisted diagnostic tools extend capacity beyond physical facilities.

**Workforce Layer**: Nurse recruitment, training programs, and retention initiatives address chronic shortages, though at scales insufficient to transform baseline conditions.

**Infrastructure Layer**: Cybersecurity enhancements, laboratory expansion, and health information technology investments strengthen operational foundations.

The connections between layers are stronger in Georgia's application than in some state plans. Technology deployment depends on resilient facilities. Workforce deployment requires secure systems. However, **social care integration appears as a minor component** rather than a coordinated initiative, distinguishing Georgia's approach from states with explicit SDOH strategies.

## Initiative 1: Disaster Resilience and Shelter-in-Place Capacity

### Design and Mechanics

The flagship infrastructure initiative provides rural Georgia hospitals with **capacity to shelter in place during disasters and severe storms**. The $175 million proposed allocation (over five years) represents the largest single line item in Georgia's application, reflecting the state's hurricane vulnerability and lessons from recent disasters.

Core components:

**Generator and Power Redundancy**: Backup power systems enabling hospitals to maintain operations during extended outages. Rural hospitals frequently lack generator capacity sufficient for prolonged emergencies.

**Structural Hardening**: Physical improvements enabling facilities to withstand severe weather including wind, flooding, and storm surge in coastal and low-lying areas.

**Supply Stockpiling**: Essential medical supplies, pharmaceuticals, and equipment positioning to sustain operations when supply chains fail during disasters.

**Communication Systems**: Redundant communication infrastructure ensuring coordination with emergency management and regional health systems during events.

### Target Population and Geography

The initiative prioritizes **hospitals in hurricane and severe weather corridors**, particularly:

| Region | Facilities | Rationale |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| Southwest Georgia | 8-10 hospitals | Hurricane vulnerability, prior closures |
| Coastal Georgia | 6-8 hospitals | Storm surge, flooding risk |
| South Central Georgia | 10-12 hospitals | Tornado corridor, isolated communities |
| Black Belt counties | 6-8 hospitals | Extreme poverty, limited infrastructure |

**Southwest Georgia** receives particular emphasis following Southwest Georgia Regional Medical Center's October 2020 closure in Cuthbert. Communities in Clay, Early, and Miller counties already travel 30 to 60 minutes for emergency care. Disaster preparedness prevents remaining facilities from failing during weather events.

### Funding Allocation

**Estimated FY2026: $35-40 million** (first year of five-year $175 million initiative)

| Component | Allocation | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| Generator systems | $12-15M | Backup power for 20-25 facilities |
| Structural improvements | $10-12M | Wind and flood hardening |
| Supply stockpiling | $5-7M | Medical supply positioning |
| Communication systems | $4-5M | Redundant networks |
| Emergency planning | $2-3M | Protocol development |

### Subawardees

DCH will distribute funds through **direct awards to qualifying rural hospitals**:

- Critical Access Hospitals (29 in Georgia)
- Rural hospitals meeting size and location criteria
- Hospital authorities in designated disaster-risk counties
- Regional health systems with rural facilities

### What Success Looks Like

**Year 1 metrics**: 20+ facilities with enhanced generator capacity; 15+ facilities with structural hardening plans initiated; regional supply stockpiles established in three geographic zones.

**Five-year outcome**: No rural hospital closure or extended service interruption due to disaster preparedness failure.

## Initiative 2: Telehealth Pods and Virtual Care

### Design and Mechanics

Georgia proposes **drop-in telehealth "pods"** positioned throughout rural communities, providing residents with access to virtual specialist consultations without traveling to distant facilities. The $17 million allocation creates infrastructure where patients can walk in, connect with providers, and receive care supported by on-site staff.

Core components:

**Telehealth Pod Deployment**: Standalone or co-located facilities equipped with video consultation technology, basic diagnostic equipment, and connectivity infrastructure. Pods may be positioned in libraries, community centers, health departments, or purpose-built facilities.

**Staffing Model**: Health workers or trained staff assist patients with technology, conduct basic vital signs, and facilitate connections with remote providers. The application does not specify whether staff are licensed clinical personnel or community health workers.

**Specialist Network**: Virtual connections to specialists in cardiology, behavioral health, dermatology, endocrinology, and other disciplines concentrated in urban Georgia.

**Integration with Primary Care**: Pods supplement rather than replace primary care, with consultation results forwarded to patients' regular providers.

### Target Population and Geography

Telehealth pods prioritize **communities with minimal existing healthcare infrastructure**:

| Target Area | Population | Pod Locations |
|-------------|------------|---------------|
| Black Belt counties | ~150,000 | 8-12 pods |
| Southwest Georgia | ~200,000 | 10-15 pods |
| Northeast Georgia mountains | ~100,000 | 6-8 pods |
| South Central Georgia | ~150,000 | 8-10 pods |

Geographic placement considers both healthcare deserts and **broadband availability**. Communities without reliable internet connectivity require satellite solutions before pod deployment, creating dependency on the Starlink initiative.

### Funding Allocation

**Estimated FY2026: $17 million**

| Component | Allocation | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| Pod construction/equipment | $8-10M | 30-40 pods |
| Technology infrastructure | $3-4M | Connectivity, software |
| Staffing support | $2-3M | First-year personnel |
| Training | $1-2M | Staff certification |
| Evaluation | $1M | Outcome tracking |

### Subawardees

Potential pod operators and subawardees include:

- Georgia Health Districts (18 statewide)
- Public libraries (Georgia Public Library Service)
- Federally Qualified Health Centers (35 FQHCs statewide)
- Rural hospitals with outreach programs
- Community Action Agencies

### Technology Vendor Landscape

The application **does not mandate specific technology vendors** for telehealth platform or equipment. Procurement will determine platform selection. Current telehealth providers operating in Georgia include:

| Vendor | Presence | Potential Role |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| Teladoc Health | Active statewide | Platform candidate |
| Amwell | Active with health systems | Platform candidate |
| Georgia Partnership for TeleHealth | State program | Network expansion |
| MDLive | Commercial presence | Possible integration |

## Initiative 3: Starlink Satellite Connectivity

### Design and Mechanics

Georgia proposes contracting with **Elon Musk's Starlink satellite internet system** to provide broadband connectivity for rural healthcare facilities and telehealth pods. This initiative addresses the fundamental infrastructure barrier preventing technology deployment in unconnected areas.

Core components:

**Healthcare Facility Connectivity**: Starlink terminals and service for rural hospitals, clinics, and health departments lacking reliable broadband.

**Telehealth Pod Support**: Satellite connectivity enabling pod deployment in communities without terrestrial broadband.

**Backup Connectivity**: Redundant internet connections for facilities with unreliable primary service.

### Target Population

Starlink deployment prioritizes facilities in areas where **terrestrial broadband is unavailable or unreliable**:

- Facilities in counties with less than 50% broadband coverage
- Hospitals and clinics with documented connectivity failures
- Telehealth pod locations without fiber or cable options
- Emergency communication backup for disaster-vulnerable facilities

### Funding Allocation

**Estimated FY2026: $8-12 million**

| Component | Allocation | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| Terminal procurement | $3-4M | 200+ terminals |
| Installation | $1-2M | Professional setup |
| Service subscriptions | $3-4M | First-year connectivity |
| Technical support | $1-2M | Maintenance, troubleshooting |

### Subawardees

- Starlink/SpaceX (service contract)
- Rural hospitals (terminal recipients)
- Health districts (distribution coordination)

### Implementation Considerations

Starlink selection raises questions about **sole-source contracting** and long-term sustainability. Satellite internet service requires ongoing subscription payments. Georgia's application does not specify how facilities will afford continued service after RHTP funding ends. The choice of Starlink, specifically named in the application, also reflects alignment with priorities associated with the Trump administration.

## Initiative 4: Newborn Screening Laboratory Expansion

### Design and Mechanics

The initiative expands newborn screening capacity at the **Waycross Public Health Laboratory**, enhancing Georgia's ability to identify metabolic, genetic, and other conditions in newborns requiring early intervention.

Core components:

**Laboratory Equipment**: Advanced screening equipment enabling faster processing and expanded condition detection.

**Capacity Expansion**: Physical and operational improvements increasing throughput to serve Georgia's 120,000+ annual births.

**Result Turnaround**: Reduced time between specimen collection and result delivery to physicians.

**Condition Panel Expansion**: Additional screenable conditions beyond current state requirements.

### Target Population

All Georgia newborns benefit from enhanced screening capacity, with particular impact on rural families who face longer travel times to specialty care when conditions are identified.

### Funding Allocation

**Estimated FY2026: $10-15 million**

| Component | Allocation | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| Laboratory equipment | $6-8M | Screening systems |
| Facility improvements | $2-3M | Waycross expansion |
| Staff training | $1-2M | Technical certification |
| IT systems | $1-2M | Result reporting |

### Subawardees

- DCH Public Health Division (direct implementation)
- Waycross Health District (facility host)
- Equipment vendors (procurement)

## Initiative 5: Cybersecurity Enhancement

### Design and Mechanics

Rural healthcare organizations face increasing **cybersecurity threats** while operating with limited IT resources. Multiple Georgia hospitals have experienced ransomware attacks in recent years, disrupting operations and compromising patient data.

Core components:

**Security Assessments**: Professional evaluation of rural hospital and clinic IT systems, identifying vulnerabilities and compliance gaps.

**Vulnerability Remediation**: Funding for security improvements including network segmentation, endpoint protection, backup systems, and access controls.

**Staff Training**: Cybersecurity awareness education for healthcare workers addressing phishing, password security, and incident response.

**Incident Response Planning**: Development of cybersecurity incident response protocols and business continuity plans.

### Target Population

**Primary beneficiaries**: Rural hospitals, FQHCs, and Rural Health Clinics with limited IT security capacity.

### Funding Allocation

**Estimated FY2026: $12-15 million**

| Component | Allocation | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| Security assessments | $3-4M | Third-party evaluations |
| Vulnerability remediation | $6-8M | Security improvements |
| Staff training | $2-3M | Education programs |
| Incident response | $1-2M | Protocol development |

### Subawardees

- Rural hospitals and hospital authorities
- FQHCs and Rural Health Clinics
- Cybersecurity vendors (selected through procurement)

## Initiative 6: Nurse Recruitment and Retention

### Design and Mechanics

The workforce initiative addresses **chronic nursing shortages** in rural Georgia through recruitment incentives, scholarship programs, and retention support.

Core components:

**Recruitment Programs**: Active recruitment campaigns targeting nursing graduates, experienced nurses, and career-changers for rural positions.

**Scholarship and Loan Repayment**: Financial support for nursing students committing to rural practice, and loan repayment for nurses accepting rural positions.

**Retention Incentives**: Programs supporting nurses already working in rural facilities to reduce turnover.

**Training Partnerships**: Collaboration with nursing programs at Augusta University, Georgia Southern, and community colleges to expand rural clinical rotations.

### Target Population

**Primary beneficiaries**: Rural hospitals facing nursing vacancies; nursing students and graduates considering rural careers; experienced nurses potentially relocating to rural practice.

### Funding Allocation

**Estimated FY2026: $20-25 million**

| Component | Allocation | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| Recruitment campaigns | $4-5M | Marketing, placement |
| Scholarships | $8-10M | Student support |
| Loan repayment | $5-7M | Graduate incentives |
| Retention programs | $3-4M | Current staff support |

### Subawardees

- Augusta University College of Nursing
- Georgia Southern University
- Albany State University
- Technical College System of Georgia
- Rural hospitals (retention program partners)
- HomeTown Health (rural hospital consortium)
- Georgia Hospital Association

### Implementation Considerations

**Jimmy Lewis, CEO of HomeTown Health**, emphasized that rural hospitals need workforce transformation funding used properly: "We're talking about how to educate ourselves out of the workforce shortage. And we've got to figure out how to use money in health delivery and access." Lewis cautioned that RHTP's time-limited nature limits workforce development impact.

## Initiative 7: Health Information Technology

### Design and Mechanics

The HIT initiative funds **electronic health record upgrades, interoperability improvements, and AI-assisted diagnostic tools** at rural healthcare organizations.

Core components:

**EHR Modernization**: Replacement or upgrade of aging electronic health record systems at rural facilities.

**Interoperability**: Health information exchange infrastructure enabling data sharing between rural providers and regional health systems.

**AI Diagnostic Support**: Clinical decision support tools using artificial intelligence to assist rural providers with diagnosis and treatment planning.

**Remote Patient Monitoring**: Technology infrastructure supporting chronic disease management through home-based monitoring devices.

### Target Population

**Primary beneficiaries**: Rural hospitals, FQHCs, and Rural Health Clinics with outdated health IT systems.

### Funding Allocation

**Estimated FY2026: $18-22 million**

| Component | Allocation | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| EHR upgrades | $8-10M | System replacement, migration |
| Interoperability | $4-5M | HIE connections |
| AI diagnostic tools | $3-4M | Clinical decision support |
| Remote monitoring | $3-4M | Device and platform deployment |

### Subawardees

- Rural hospitals and hospital authorities
- FQHCs
- Georgia Health Information Exchange (GA-HITREC)
- Technology vendors (selected through procurement)

## Initiative 8: Health Transportation Networks

### Design and Mechanics

Transportation barriers prevent rural Georgians from accessing healthcare. The initiative expands **non-emergency medical transportation** capacity in underserved areas.

Core components:

**Vehicle Procurement**: Funding for medical transport vehicles operated by health departments, hospitals, or community organizations.

**Volunteer Driver Programs**: Support for programs coordinating volunteer transportation for medical appointments.

**Ride-Share Partnerships**: Subsidized medical transportation through Lyft, Uber Health, or similar services where available.

**Coordination Infrastructure**: Scheduling and dispatch systems managing transportation requests.

### Target Population

Rural residents without reliable transportation who miss medical appointments or delay care due to access barriers.

### Funding Allocation

**Estimated FY2026: $8-12 million**

| Component | Allocation | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| Vehicle procurement | $4-5M | Medical transport fleet |
| Volunteer programs | $2-3M | Driver coordination |
| Ride-share subsidies | $1-2M | On-demand transport |
| Coordination systems | $1-2M | Scheduling technology |

### Subawardees

- Health districts (transportation coordination)
- Community Action Agencies
- Rural hospitals (patient transport)
- Transportation providers

## Initiative 9: Gateway Medicaid System Upgrades

### Design and Mechanics

Georgia's Medicaid eligibility system, Gateway, has experienced **persistent technical difficulties** that complicate enrollment and burden both applicants and providers. The $30 million line item addresses eligibility determination infrastructure.

Core components:

**System Modernization**: Technology upgrades to the Gateway eligibility and enrollment system.

**Eligibility Processing**: Improvements enabling faster, more accurate eligibility determinations.

**Integration**: Connections between Gateway and healthcare provider systems.

### Relationship to Georgia Pathways

The Gateway upgrades have particular relevance given **Georgia Pathways' enrollment struggles**. As of late 2024, Pathways enrolled only 6,500 active participants against projections of 100,000 by program end. ProPublica and The Current reported that Pathways spent $86.9 million through June 2025 while only 8,077 members ever enrolled, with 47 percent of spending going to eligibility technology and consultants rather than healthcare benefits.

If Gateway system failures contribute to enrollment difficulties, technology investment might improve Pathways participation. However, the work requirement itself appears to be the primary barrier rather than system technology.

### Funding Allocation

**Estimated FY2026: $30 million**

| Component | Allocation | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| System upgrades | $18-20M | Platform modernization |
| Integration | $6-8M | Provider connections |
| Testing and deployment | $4-6M | Implementation |

### Implementation Considerations

This initiative raises questions about whether **RHTP funds should address Medicaid administrative systems** rather than direct healthcare transformation. The allocation benefits the state's eligibility infrastructure but does not directly improve rural healthcare delivery.

## Social Care Integration

### SDOH/HRSN Initiatives

Georgia's RHTP application **does not include dedicated social determinants of health initiatives**. Unlike states with explicit SDOH screening requirements or health-related social needs programming, Georgia's approach embeds minimal social care components within other initiatives.

| SDOH Component | Status in Georgia Application |
|----------------|------------------------------|
| Screening requirements | Not explicitly funded |
| Navigation infrastructure | Not funded |
| Dedicated navigators | Not funded |
| Closed-loop referral system | Not funded |
| Resource directory maintenance | Not addressed |

The telehealth pod initiative may include intake questions about social needs, but the application does not specify screening protocols or referral mechanisms. Health transportation addresses one social need category but lacks integration with broader social care infrastructure.

### Community Health Worker Programs

Georgia's application **does not include distinct Community Health Worker deployment as a named initiative**. CHWs may be included within telehealth pod staffing or workforce development, but the application does not specify:

| Element | Status |
|---------|--------|
| CHW training pipeline | Not explicitly funded |
| CHW employment support | Not explicitly funded |
| Supervision infrastructure | Not addressed |
| Statewide deployment targets | Not specified |

Georgia has existing CHW certification through the Georgia Department of Public Health, and some health districts employ CHWs. However, RHTP does not fund CHW expansion as a transformative initiative.

### Community Information Exchange and Referral Platforms

Georgia's application **does not mandate CIE platform procurement or fund statewide social care referral infrastructure**.

| CIE Element | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| Statewide platform | Not funded |
| Regional integration | Not funded |
| EHR interoperability | Within HIT (not SDOH-focused) |
| 211 integration | Not addressed |
| Resource directory | Not funded |

### Technology Vendor Landscape

**Current SDOH/CIE platforms operating in Georgia**:

| Platform | Presence | Coverage |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Unite Us | Limited | Some health systems |
| Findhelp | Moderate | Resource directory |
| 211 Georgia | Statewide | Information and referral |

Without RHTP investment, Georgia's social care integration infrastructure depends on fragmented adoption by individual health systems and organizations.

### Social Care Assessment

Georgia's application **prioritizes physical infrastructure and technology over social care integration**. This represents a deliberate choice, not an oversight. Stakeholder input prioritized technology solutions over social care, and the application reflects those priorities.

The absence of dedicated SDOH/HRSN funding positions Georgia as a **minimal social care integration state** within the RHTP landscape. Part 3 will assess implications of this approach for population health outcomes and transformation effectiveness.

## Stakeholder Architecture

### Lead Agency Role

The **Georgia Department of Community Health** serves as sole lead agency with consolidated authority over Medicaid, public health, and healthcare regulation. This consolidation simplifies governance compared to states where multiple agencies share RHTP responsibility.

Commissioner Dr. Dean Burke, a physician with rural health experience, brings credibility to engagement with provider communities. DCH's dual role managing both Medicaid and public health creates potential for integrated implementation but also concentrates risk if agency capacity proves insufficient.

### Key Partner Organizations

**Georgia Hospital Association (GHA)**: The statewide hospital association represents both urban and rural hospitals. GHA leadership provided cautious endorsement of RHTP, noting that funding could provide a "meaningful boost" through technology and workforce investment while warning that "grant funds will not fund ongoing operations."

**HomeTown Health**: The rural hospital consortium led by Jimmy Lewis represents 58 rural and community hospitals. HomeTown Health advocates aggressively for rural hospital interests and voiced concerns about RHTP's time-limited nature and the parallel threat from Medicaid cuts.

**Georgia Primary Care Association**: Represents FQHCs and advocates for community health center inclusion in transformation initiatives.

**Area Health Education Centers (AHECs)**: Georgia's AHEC network supports workforce development and clinical education rotations.

**Academic Medical Centers**: Augusta University, Emory, and Morehouse serve as referral destinations and potential workforce development partners.

### Provider Participation

**Rural Hospital Landscape**: Georgia has approximately 30 rural hospitals meeting various rural definitions. Twenty-nine are designated Critical Access Hospitals. Eleven rural hospitals have closed since 2010, tying Georgia with Kansas, Mississippi, Missouri, and Oklahoma for third-most closures nationally (behind Texas's 26 and Tennessee's 16).

**FQHC Network**: Georgia has 35 Federally Qualified Health Centers operating over 200 service sites. FQHCs serve both rural and urban populations, raising questions noted in news coverage about whether RHTP funds might flow to urban FQHC locations.

**Rural Health Clinics**: Approximately 100 certified Rural Health Clinics provide primary care in rural areas.

### Community Organization Involvement

Georgia's application does not establish formal community advisory structures or community governance requirements for subawardees. Community organizations may participate as:

- Telehealth pod operators
- Transportation providers
- Workforce development partners

The absence of explicit community governance mechanisms distinguishes Georgia from states with stronger community engagement requirements.

### Payer Relationships

RHTP funding flows **directly from CMS to DCH to providers**, bypassing Medicaid managed care organizations. Georgia's Medicaid program includes managed care elements, but MCOs have no formal role in RHTP implementation.

Georgia Pathways' limited enrollment means that coverage expansion cannot generate significant payer engagement with transformed systems. The coverage gap persists regardless of infrastructure investment.

## Budget Flow and Timeline

### Allocation Across Initiatives

| **Total** | **$218.8M** | **100%** |

### Subaward Structure

Georgia will use a **mixed approach** combining direct awards to state facilities and competitive procurement:

1. Direct awards to state-operated facilities (laboratory, health districts)
2. Competitive subawards to hospitals for resilience and technology
3. Contracts with technology vendors for connectivity and platforms
4. Grants to workforce development partners

### Administrative Retention

DCH retains **approximately 7-9%** of total award for program administration:

| Administrative Function | Estimated Cost |
|------------------------|----------------|
| Program Office staffing | $4-5M |
| Grants management | $3-4M |
| Data and evaluation | $3-4M |
| Technical assistance | $2-3M |
| Reporting and compliance | $2-3M |

### Performance Monitoring

DCH monitors program performance through:

- Quarterly progress reports from subawardees
- Financial reporting and audit
- Site visits (selected subawardees)
- Outcome evaluation

### Two-Year Obligation Requirement

RHTP requires states to **obligate FY2026 funds within two years** (by September 30, 2027). Georgia's implementation timeline:

| Phase | Timeline | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Planning and procurement | Jan-Jun 2026 | Pending |
| Subaward execution | Jul-Dec 2026 | Planned |
| Implementation | Jan 2027-Sep 2027 | Planned |
| Full obligation | By Sep 2027 | Targeted |

DCH's consolidated authority and existing infrastructure position Georgia to meet obligation deadlines, though detailed implementation plans remain pending as of January 2026.

## What the Plan Assumes

### Explicit Assumptions

The Georgia application explicitly or implicitly states:

1. **Disaster resilience is the priority barrier.** Georgia's rural hospitals cannot serve communities if they fail during storms. Infrastructure investment precedes service transformation.

2. **Technology extends capacity faster than workforce development.** Telehealth pods and satellite connectivity bring specialist care to communities that cannot recruit specialists.

3. **Existing programs provide a foundation.** Georgia Health Districts, public health laboratories, and hospital networks create implementation capacity.

4. **Federal priorities favor technology and resilience.** Annual re-scoring will reward demonstrated infrastructure progress.

### Implicit Assumptions

The application implicitly assumes:

1. **Coverage gaps do not prevent transformation.** Rural Georgians without insurance will benefit from transformed healthcare systems they cannot afford to use.

2. **Georgia Pathways enrollment will improve.** Gateway system upgrades and administrative improvements will increase participation beyond current minimal levels.

3. **Social care integration is unnecessary for transformation.** Physical infrastructure and technology investment produces health outcomes without dedicated SDOH programming.

4. **Hospital closure trajectory stabilizes.** RHTP initiatives prevent additional closures despite continued financial pressure from uncompensated care and potential Medicaid cuts.

5. **Starlink dependency is sustainable.** Facilities receiving satellite connectivity will afford ongoing service after RHTP funding ends.

### Dependencies on External Factors

| Factor | Dependency Level | Risk |
|--------|-----------------|------|
| Medicaid cuts (H.R. 1) | High | Cuts accelerate hospital closures RHTP cannot prevent |
| Georgia Pathways | Moderate | Enrollment failure limits coverage impact |
| Federal scoring criteria | Moderate | Priority changes could disadvantage approach |
| Starlink pricing | Moderate | Service cost sustainability uncertain |
| Weather events | High | Major disaster could consume resilience investment |

### Risks Acknowledged Versus Ignored

**Acknowledged in application**:

- Broadband limitations requiring satellite solutions
- Workforce shortages exceeding RHTP capacity
- Implementation capacity constraints

**Not explicitly acknowledged**:

- Coverage gap as fundamental barrier to transformation
- Medicaid cut implications from H.R. 1
- Georgia Pathways enrollment failure
- Social care integration value
- 2030 funding cliff and sustainability
- FQHCs potentially diverting funds to urban locations

## Conclusion

Georgia proposes to transform rural healthcare for 2.9 million residents with $75 per person annually. The **GREAT Health** strategy responds by prioritizing disaster resilience and technology deployment over social care integration and workforce expansion.

The plan reflects Georgia's geographic reality. Hurricanes and severe weather threaten rural hospitals. Southwest Georgia communities already travel 30 to 60 minutes for care after prior closures. Infrastructure that survives disasters provides the foundation for any subsequent transformation.

The plan's limitations are equally clear. Technology initiatives serve communities with connectivity while creating Starlink dependencies. Workforce programs begin pipelines that produce providers after RHTP ends. Social care integration receives no dedicated funding. The coverage gap persists, with Georgia Pathways enrolling fewer than 7,000 against 175,000 in the gap.
