# RHTP 3.WA: Washington
## The Evergreen State's Rural Health Transformation

*Series 3: State Implementation*

Washington presents a tale of two states. The Puget Sound corridor concentrates population, economic activity, and healthcare resources in a narrow urban band. Beyond the Cascade Range, rural and frontier communities stretch across vast distances with starkly different healthcare realities. Of Washington's 39 counties, **22 qualify as fully rural** while the remaining 17 contain substantial rural portions. More than **1.1 million Washingtonians live in rural areas**, roughly 15% of the state's population spread across 70% of its geography.

The state received **$181 million in first-year RHTP funding**, below the $200 million requested and below the national average. For a state that developed a bipartisan proposal with strong stakeholder engagement, the shortfall reflects the formula's structural preferences for states with larger rural populations and more severe facility distress. Washington's relatively healthy urban healthcare system and moderate rural population size work against it in funding calculations that reward crisis over capacity.

## Rural Health Landscape

### Healthcare Infrastructure

Washington maintains a substantial rural healthcare infrastructure distinguished by its **public hospital district model**:

| Facility Type | Count | Notes |
|---------------|-------|-------|
| Critical Access Hospitals | 39 | Most operate as public hospital districts |
| Rural Health Clinics | 100+ | Distributed across rural counties |
| Federally Qualified Health Centers | 25+ organizations | Multiple sites per organization |
| Public Hospital Districts | 55 | Local property tax authority |

The 39 Critical Access Hospitals form the backbone of rural Washington's healthcare system. **Most CAHs operate as public hospital districts**, a governance model allowing communities to levy property taxes supporting their local hospitals. This structure provides financial stability that private rural hospitals in other states lack, but it also creates dependency on local tax bases that vary dramatically across communities.

**Approximately half of Washington's 39 CAHs face financial stress** severe enough to threaten near-term viability. The combination of cost-based Medicare reimbursement that fails to cover true costs, Medicaid rates below cost, and limited commercial payer volume creates structural deficits that tax levies struggle to offset.

### Workforce Shortages

Rural and frontier counties continue to lose healthcare workers to urban centers, particularly **Missoula, Spokane, and the Puget Sound region**. The drain affects nurses, nursing assistants, and patient representatives most severely. Physician shortages concentrate in primary care, mental health, and specialty access.

The state ranks among the more favorable nationally for overall physician supply, but distribution creates acute rural shortages. Urban medical centers attract graduates while rural communities struggle to compete on compensation, professional development, and family amenities.

**Critical gaps include:**
- Primary care physicians in eastern Washington and peninsula communities
- Behavioral health providers across all rural areas
- Obstetric providers leading to service line closures
- Emergency physicians willing to practice in low-volume settings

### Geographic and Demographic Context

Washington's rural population differs from many states in important ways. **Higher income than many rural populations** creates expectations for healthcare quality matching urban standards. Rural Washingtonians often moved from urban areas for lifestyle reasons and maintain connections requiring comparable access.

**Aging demographics** accelerate chronic disease burden and complex care needs. Senior concentrations in rural and semi-rural areas strain limited primary care and specialty capacity.

**Tribal populations** represent significant rural communities. Washington's 29 federally recognized tribes operate health programs that interact with state RHTP implementation.

**Agricultural worker populations** in central and eastern Washington face seasonal access challenges and language barriers. Migrant and seasonal workers often lack continuity of care.

## RHTP Award and Context

| Metric | Washington | National Average |
|--------|------------|------------------|
| FY2026 Award | $181 million | $200 million |
| Five-Year Projected Total | ~$905 million | ~$1 billion |
| Rural Population | ~1.1 million | Varies |
| Per-Capita (Rural) | ~$165 | ~$150 |
| Award Rank | 21st | N/A |

Washington's per-capita figure of approximately **$165 places it in the middle of the pack nationally**. The state's moderate rural population means each resident receives more than heavily rural states like Texas (~$60 per capita) but less than sparsely populated states that benefit from the formula's geographic weighting. The Washington State Hospital Association expressed no surprise at receiving less than requested, while The Rural Collaborative characterized the award as "a pleasant surprise" relative to more pessimistic projections.

**Medicaid Expansion Status:** Washington expanded Medicaid under the ACA. Apple Health (Washington's Medicaid program) covers approximately 2.2 million Washingtonians statewide, with substantial rural enrollment.

**Medicaid Cut Exposure:** The state faces significant coverage disruption from H.R. 1 provisions:
- **200,000 to 320,000 Apple Health enrollees** may lose coverage
- **100,000 to 150,000 Washington Healthplanfinder participants** face potential disruption
- Rural providers disproportionately depend on Medicaid revenue

Washington's RHTP award of $181 million annually cannot offset Medicaid coverage losses affecting hundreds of thousands of residents. The program can strengthen provider capacity, but coverage erosion reduces the patient base that sustains rural facilities.

## State Approach

### Governance Structure

**Health Care Authority (HCA)** serves as the lead agency with responsibility for fund administration, CMS coordination, and performance oversight.

The governance model integrates existing infrastructure:

**The Rural Collaborative (TRC)**, representing Washington's rural hospitals, serves as a key implementation partner. TRC has operated for years as a network supporting rural hospital quality improvement, advocacy, and shared services.

**Washington State Hospital Association (WSHA)** provides technical assistance, quality improvement support, and coordination across rural and urban hospitals.

**Tribal consultation** occurs through the Office of Tribal Affairs with explicit commitment to **10% allocation for tribal health priorities**.

### Strategic Framework

Washington's application organizes transformation around **five priority areas**, developed through bipartisan collaboration between HCA, Department of Health, and Department of Social and Health Services:

1. **Preserve and Expand Access:** Stabilizing rural facilities and expanding service availability
2. **Strengthen Rural Behavioral Health:** Building capacity that reduces strain on hospitals and schools
3. **Grow and Retain Workforce:** Building sustainable workforce pipelines
4. **Expand Technology and Innovation:** Extending care capacity through telehealth and digital tools
5. **Support Long-Term Financial Sustainability:** Preparing rural providers for post-RHTP viability

The state participated in CMS's **Community Health Access and Rural Transformation (CHART) Model** and Making Care Primary Model, building experience with alternative payment approaches that RHTP can accelerate. **Approximately 80% of Washington's health spending** for Medicaid MCOs and state employees ties to quality performance expectations.

## Program and Funding Distribution

| Program | Allocation (Est.) | Implementing Organization | Focus |
|---------|-------------------|--------------------------|-------|
| Rural Facility Stabilization | $45 million | HCA/TRC | Direct support for financially stressed CAHs, ED stabilization |
| Behavioral Health Integration | $35 million | HCA/DOH | Workforce recruitment, primary care integration, crisis services |
| Workforce Pipeline | $30 million | UW Partnership/HCA | Loan repayment, training expansion, retention incentives |
| Telehealth Infrastructure | $25 million | WSHA/TRC | Specialty access, remote monitoring, data interoperability |
| Tribal Health Priorities | $18 million | Tribal Health Programs | 10% allocation, culturally appropriate services |
| Value-Based Payment Transition | $15 million | HCA/CCOs | VBP adoption support, revenue diversification |
| Mobile Health Services | $8 million | Regional Providers | Outreach to communities lacking fixed facilities |
| Administrative/Oversight | $5 million | HCA | CMS reporting, performance monitoring |

**Note:** Allocations are estimates based on application priorities. Final distributions pending revised budget submission to CMS (January 2026).

## Social Care Integration

Washington's application includes **social determinants components embedded across multiple initiatives** rather than as standalone programs. The state's existing Medicaid managed care structure provides infrastructure for SDOH screening and referral.

| Component | Included in Plan | Funding (Est.) | Vendor/Operator | Likely Funded? |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| SDOH/HRSN Screening | Yes | Embedded | MCOs/HCA | Yes |
| HRSN Navigation | Yes | ~$8 million | Area Agencies on Aging, CBOs | At Risk |
| CHW Deployment | Limited | ~$5 million | Regional partners | At Risk |
| CIE Platform | In Development | MTP 2.0 funded | Comagine Health (Lead Org) | Yes (2026) |

### SDOH Screening and Navigation

Washington's **five Medicaid managed care organizations** already implement SDOH screening requirements under existing HCA contracts. RHTP investments extend these capabilities to rural providers not currently participating in MCO networks.

**Area Agencies on Aging** serve as primary partners for senior-focused HRSN navigation given rural demographic patterns. Existing AAA infrastructure reduces startup costs but limits scope to aging populations.

### Community Health Worker Programs

CHW deployment appears in the application but lacks dedicated funding stream. The state anticipates **integrating CHWs within behavioral health and chronic disease initiatives** rather than building separate CHW infrastructure.

Washington's existing CHW certification program provides regulatory framework, but RHTP funding for CHW deployment remains vulnerable to budget triage under partial award.

### Technology Platform Status

Washington is **building statewide CIE infrastructure** under the Medicaid Transformation Project (MTP 2.0). In September 2025, HCA announced **Comagine Health as the Lead Organization** for the CIE program, with an anticipated start of October 2025.

**Comagine Health CIE Program Timeline:**
- Fall 2025: Community engagement and communications
- Spring 2026: Form workgroups, establish governance, finalize technology requirements
- Summer 2026: Launch procurement for CIE technology platform

**Current Vendor Landscape:**
- **Unite Washington:** Unite Us operates a regional network in Washington, primarily serving health systems and ACHs in select regions. Not yet statewide.
- **Findhelp:** Resource directory available statewide for public searches. Some provider and health system deployments.
- **Washington 211:** Statewide network partnering with Comagine Health on CIE development, providing community connection expertise.

**RHTP Implications:** Washington's CIE program is under development rather than operational. RHTP social care referrals will initially rely on existing MCO systems and regional deployments until statewide CIE technology is procured in 2026.

## Key Subawardees

| Organization | Type | Contract Value (Est.) | Role in RHTP Implementation |
|--------------|------|----------------------|----------------------------|
| The Rural Collaborative (TRC) | Intermediary | $25 million | Network coordination, technical assistance, quality improvement |
| Washington State Hospital Association | Intermediary | $15 million | Hospital coordination, data systems, policy support |
| University of Washington | Academic Partner | $20 million | Workforce pipeline, Project ECHO expansion, residency support |
| Area Agencies on Aging | Regional Partners | $12 million | Senior services, SDOH navigation, care coordination |
| Tribal Health Programs (29 tribes) | Tribal Partners | $18 million | 10% allocation, culturally appropriate care delivery |
| Comagine Health | CIE Lead Organization | MTP 2.0 funded | Statewide CIE program development and management |
| Washington 211 | Community Network | MTP 2.0 funded | CIE partner, resource directory, community connections |
| Regional Health Systems | Provider Networks | $30 million | Service delivery, training sites, specialty access |
| Community Health Centers | Safety Net | $15 million | Primary care access, workforce deployment |

### Intermediary Structure

**The Rural Collaborative** serves as primary intermediary connecting 39 CAHs. TRC's existing relationships and quality improvement infrastructure positions it to distribute RHTP resources efficiently. The organization's decade of network development creates coordination capacity absent in most states.

**WSHA** provides complementary support for broader hospital community, including urban systems with rural affiliate relationships. WSHA's data capabilities and policy expertise supplement TRC's rural focus.

### Public Hospital District Integration

Washington's **55 public hospital districts** shape implementation significantly:
- Districts provide local governance and community accountability
- Property tax authority creates baseline financial support
- Tax base limitations create uneven capacity across communities
- RHTP funds supplement but cannot replace local tax support

## Assessment

### Strengths

**Public Hospital District Foundation:** Washington's public hospital district model provides governance and financing infrastructure that most states lack. Local tax authority creates community investment in hospital survival. RHTP can build on this foundation rather than creating new structures.

**Value-Based Payment Experience:** With 80% of relevant spending tied to quality expectations and experience with CHART and Making Care Primary models, Washington providers understand performance accountability. RHTP metrics align with established practice patterns.

**Bipartisan Development:** The collaborative process between Democratic state leadership and Republican-leaning rural communities creates political sustainability. RHTP implementation is less likely to face partisan opposition that derails programs in other states.

**Network Infrastructure:** TRC and WSHA provide coordination capacity connecting 39 CAHs for shared learning, quality improvement, and advocacy. Network effects amplify individual facility investments.

**Tribal Commitment:** The explicit 10% allocation for tribal health priorities acknowledges the significant tribal population in rural Washington and creates accountability for serving these communities.

### Vulnerabilities

**Award Shortfall:** Receiving $181 million versus $200 million requested requires scope reduction. Initiatives will proceed but with narrower reach or longer timelines than originally planned.

**Half of CAHs at Risk:** With approximately half of 39 CAHs facing financial stress severe enough to threaten viability, RHTP funds may flow to stabilization rather than transformation. Keeping facilities open represents success but falls short of systemic improvement.

**Workforce Competition:** The Puget Sound region's economic strength creates competition for healthcare workers that rural communities cannot match. RHTP incentives may be insufficient to overcome urban pull factors.

**Social Care Infrastructure Timing:** SDOH components spread across multiple initiatives without dedicated funding stream. Statewide CIE technology procurement not until Summer 2026 creates gap between RHTP launch and closed-loop referral capability.

### Social Care Survival Prospects

**SDOH Screening:** Likely survives through existing MCO infrastructure requirements. No additional RHTP investment required for baseline screening.

**HRSN Navigation:** At risk. AAA partnerships provide delivery capacity, but dedicated navigation funding competes with facility stabilization priorities.

**CHW Deployment:** At risk. Limited explicit funding and integration within other initiatives suggests CHW programs face reduction under partial award.

**CIE Platform:** In development. Washington's statewide CIE program with Comagine Health as Lead Organization will procure technology in Summer 2026. Unite Washington and Findhelp provide interim regional coverage. Full closed-loop referral capability expected 2026-2027.

### The 2030 Question

Washington's sustainability strategy emphasizes:

**Value-Based Payment Integration:** Embedding RHTP initiatives within VBP structures creates ongoing financial support through performance payments rather than grant dependency.

**Public Hospital District Continuity:** Strengthening district operations builds local capacity that survives federal funding cycles.

**Academic Partnership Permanence:** UW relationships for workforce training and Project ECHO persist beyond RHTP through institutional commitment.

**Policy Commitments:** Washington's application includes policy actions around scope of practice, telehealth coverage, and rural facility support that extend beyond program timelines.

**The deeper question:** Can Washington's rural health system achieve sufficient transformation in five years to survive the post-2030 environment? With half of CAHs financially stressed and Medicaid cuts eroding revenue, the margin for error is narrow.

## Conclusion

Washington's $181 million RHTP award provides substantial investment in a rural health system with genuine structural advantages. The public hospital district model, value-based payment experience, and strong academic partnerships create implementation capacity that many states lack. The bipartisan development process suggests political durability.

The constraints are equally real. Receiving less than requested forces scope reductions. Half of CAHs face financial stress requiring stabilization before transformation. Medicaid coverage losses will reduce the patient base sustaining rural facilities regardless of RHTP investments.

Social care integration survives in developmental form. SDOH screening continues through existing MCO requirements. HRSN navigation and CHW deployment face triage risk as less visible priorities. Statewide CIE infrastructure is under development with Comagine Health, with technology procurement expected Summer 2026.

For Washington's 1.1 million rural residents, RHTP represents meaningful but bounded opportunity. The state will allocate $181 million across its five priority areas, strengthen its strongest facilities, and build workforce pipelines that take years to produce graduates. **Whether rural Washingtonians experience transformed healthcare depends on execution quality, Medicaid policy trajectories, and whether five years proves sufficient to restructure systems that decades of policy have shaped.**
