# RHTP 3.CA.2: California, The Plan

## Building Networks at Scale: California's Hub-and-Spoke Strategy

*Series 3: State Implementation*

## Introduction

Part 1 established California's core challenge: **$233.6 million in FY2026 RHTP funding** must serve **2.7 million rural residents** across 82.1 percent of the state's land area. This translates to **$86.52 per rural resident**, spread across 57 counties and 800 miles of north-south geography. The state's rural hospitals are closing or near collapse. Medicaid cuts threaten coverage for over one million Californians. Workforce shortages affect every discipline.

California's response is a **three-initiative framework** built on a central premise: **leverage existing infrastructure rather than build from scratch**. The state's plan integrates with California Advancing and Innovating Medi-Cal (CalAIM), deploys the state's health information exchange capabilities, and creates regional hub-and-spoke networks to extend specialist expertise across vast geography.

This part examines California's specific plan: what the state proposes to do, how initiatives interconnect, where money flows to specific programs and organizations, and how social care integration fits within the transformation strategy.

## The Strategic Framework

### Governance Structure

**California Department of Health Care Access and Information (HCAI)** serves as lead agency through its **State Office of Rural Health (CalSORH)**. This centralized structure creates accountability but requires coordination across multiple state entities:

| Agency | Role |
|--------|------|
| California Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) | Manages Medi-Cal and CalAIM implementation |
| California Department of Public Health | Oversees rural health clinics and public health infrastructure |
| Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development | Handles facility licensing and workforce development |
| Managed Care Plans | Implement care coordination and payment models |

A **Rural Health Partnership Council** convenes stakeholders to guide policy alignment and financing reform. The council acts as facilitator rather than decision-maker, fostering collaboration among state and local partners.

### The Theory of Change

California's approach rests on four connected assumptions:

**Infrastructure leverage**: Existing health information exchange, CalAIM programs, and FQHC networks provide foundation for rapid deployment rather than starting new systems.

**Network effects**: Hub-and-spoke models create economies of scale. Larger rural hospitals anchor regional networks. Smaller critical access hospitals and clinics function as spokes. Shared workforce, technology, and administrative functions reduce per-facility costs.

**Technology multiplication**: Telehealth and e-consult platforms extend specialist expertise without requiring specialists to relocate rurally. One cardiologist serves multiple rural facilities through virtual consultation.

**Payment reform alignment**: Transformative payments to rural hospitals fund infrastructure development. Value-based care models create sustainability beyond RHTP funding period.

The plan acknowledges that these assumptions may not hold universally. **Deep rural and frontier areas** with minimal existing infrastructure require different approaches than areas with established FQHCs or moderate-sized rural hospitals.

## Initiative 1: The Transformative Care Model

### Hub-and-Spoke Network Architecture

The Transformative Care Model creates **regional networks anchored by hospital hubs** with spokes including critical access hospitals, rural health clinics, FQHCs, birthing centers, tribal health programs, and community-based organizations.

**Hub criteria:**
- Sufficient clinical capacity to provide core services
- Technology infrastructure for telehealth deployment
- Administrative capacity for network coordination
- Geographic positioning to serve surrounding rural areas

**Spoke functions:**
- Front-door access points for primary and urgent care
- Maternal health services where volume supports
- Chronic disease management
- Behavioral health integration
- Referral pathways to hub facilities

Networks vary by region. Northern California networks differ structurally from Central Valley or eastern Sierra networks. Coastal rural areas have different hub-spoke configurations than inland areas.

### Regional Network Configuration

| Region | Designated Hub(s) | Spoke Count | Rural Population Served |
|--------|------------------|-------------|------------------------|
| Northern California/Cascade | Mercy Medical Center Redding | 8-12 CAHs, 15+ RHCs | 180,000 |
| North Coast | St. Joseph Hospital Eureka | 5-8 CAHs, 10+ RHCs | 120,000 |
| Central Valley North | Adventist Health, Rideout | 10-15 facilities | 350,000 |
| Central Valley South | Community Regional Medical, Kaweah Health | 12-18 facilities | 420,000 |
| Eastern Sierra | Northern Inyo Hospital, Mammoth Hospital | 4-6 CAHs | 65,000 |
| High Desert | Desert Regional Medical | 6-10 facilities | 180,000 |
| Central Coast | Marian Regional Medical | 5-8 facilities | 95,000 |
| Far North | Siskiyou, Modoc facilities | 4-6 CAHs | 45,000 |

### Service Line Focus

The model prioritizes **three clinical domains** based on stakeholder input:

**Primary and preventive care**: Enhanced access through extended clinic hours, same-day appointments, care coordination for chronic disease, community health worker deployment for outreach, and population health management using shared data platforms.

**Maternity care**: OB/GYN access through telemedicine, midwife and doula integration, family medicine OB fellowships supported by faculty sharing across sites, birthing centers in areas with insufficient volume for hospital-based delivery, and high-risk pregnancy identification with appropriate transfer protocols.

**Chronic disease management**: Evidence-based protocols for diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease; pharmacist-led medication management; remote patient monitoring for high-risk patients; care coordination between primary care and specialists; and nutrition counseling and food-as-medicine programs.

**Behavioral health integration** occurs across all service lines rather than as separate programming. Community health workers provide cultural liaison and care navigation.

### Payment Model Innovation

California proposes **Transformative Payments** to rural hospitals that meet performance criteria. These payments fund infrastructure development, technology deployment, and workforce recruitment rather than fee-for-service clinical activity.

Payments are:
- **Upfront**: Provided before service delivery to fund readiness
- **Performance-based**: Tied to achievement of access and quality metrics
- **Time-limited**: Designed to fund transition to sustainable payment models
- **Site-specific**: Calibrated to individual hospital needs and capabilities

The state will contract with monitoring entities to track site-specific performance. Hospitals failing to meet benchmarks face payment adjustment or recoupment.

Parallel to Transformative Payments, California will pilot **value-based arrangements** including bundled payments for maternity care, shared savings for chronic disease management, and population-based payments for primary care panels.

**The sustainability challenge is explicit**: Transformative Payments fund infrastructure development through 2030. Value-based arrangements must generate sufficient revenue to sustain operations afterward. The bet is that improved efficiency, reduced emergency utilization, and better outcomes create financial case for ongoing investment.

### Evidence-Based Care Models

California incorporates proven care extension models:

**Project ECHO**: Specialist-led virtual learning communities for primary care providers. Enables primary care management of complex conditions with specialist consultation support.

**OB Nest**: Reduced-visit prenatal care model using remote monitoring and group visits. Frees clinic capacity while maintaining quality.

**Perinatal Psychiatry Access Program (PPAP)**: Rapid psychiatric consultation for primary care providers managing perinatal mental health.

**California Child and Adolescent Mental Health Access Portal (CAL-MAP)**: Pediatric psychiatric consultation for primary care.

These models already operate in parts of California. RHTP scales them to rural areas and ensures technology infrastructure supports implementation.

## Initiative 2: Workforce Development

### Pipeline Development

California's workforce strategy addresses the **entire career pipeline** from K-12 through continuing professional education:

**K-12 exposure**: Health career exploration in rural schools, shadowing opportunities at local clinics and hospitals, partnerships with tribal youth programs, and science curriculum integration with health topics.

**Community college partnerships**: Allied health training programs in rural community colleges, clinical rotation sites at rural facilities, articulation agreements with four-year universities, and financial aid for rural students pursuing health careers.

**University partnerships**: Medical and nursing school rural training tracks, family medicine residency programs in rural areas, loan repayment programs tied to rural service commitments, and faculty sharing across rural training sites.

**Grow-your-own emphasis**: Recruiting rural residents increases likelihood of rural practice. Students from rural areas are more likely to return to or remain in rural communities.

### Recruitment and Retention

Beyond pipeline development, California funds **direct recruitment and retention mechanisms**:

**Financial incentives**: Signing bonuses for rural practice, relocation assistance, student loan repayment programs tied to five-year rural service commitments, and retention bonuses at year three and year five.

**Practice support**: Shared administrative services across network facilities, malpractice insurance assistance, continuing medical education funding, and peer support and mentorship programs.

**Quality of life**: Housing assistance in areas with limited affordable housing, spouse and partner employment support, and connection to rural lifestyle amenities.

### Workforce Model Expansion

California expands non-physician provider roles to address scope-of-practice constraints and physician shortage:

**Community Health Workers**: Perinatal CHWs for pregnancy support and chronic disease CHWs for care coordination. CHW certification programs in rural areas and integration with clinical teams.

**Doulas**: Birth doula training and placement, postpartum support for high-risk mothers, and cultural competency for tribal and immigrant populations.

**Pharmacists**: Chronic disease management, medication therapy management, and immunization delivery.

**Midwives**: Certified nurse-midwife recruitment, birth center development, and collaborative practice with physicians for high-risk cases.

**Behavioral health providers**: Licensed clinical social workers, marriage and family therapists, substance use disorder counselors, and peer support specialists.

**Physician assistants and nurse practitioners**: Advanced practice provider training with rural focus and expanded scope within existing California regulations.

The workforce strategy acknowledges California's scope-of-practice restrictions. Rather than pursue legislative reform outside RHTP scope, the plan **maximizes what existing regulations allow** through team-based care models.

## Initiative 3: Technology and Tools

### Health Information Exchange

California's existing **statewide health information exchange** provides foundation. RHTP funds:

**Rural connectivity expansion**: Ensuring all rural facilities can access the exchange, upgrading inadequate broadband where necessary, and technical assistance for smaller facilities with limited IT capacity.

**Data integration**: Connecting tribal health programs to the exchange, integrating behavioral health and substance use disorder data, and enabling county public health data sharing.

**Interoperability**: Ensuring exchange compatibility with facility EHR systems, creating standardized data formats, and enabling automated reporting for quality metrics.

### Telehealth Deployment

Comprehensive telehealth strategy addresses specialty access gaps:

**E-consults**: Asynchronous specialist consultation for primary care providers. PCP sends case information and specific questions. Specialist reviews and responds within 48-72 hours. Enables specialty guidance without patient travel.

**Virtual specialty care**: Synchronous video visits with specialists for cases requiring patient interaction but not hands-on examination. Expands access to cardiology, endocrinology, psychiatry, and other specialties.

**Tele-ICU**: Critical care specialist oversight of rural hospital ICUs. Reduces transfer burden for stable critically ill patients.

**Telestroke**: Emergency stroke consultation enabling rural facilities to administer thrombolytics within treatment window.

**Telebehavioral health**: Psychiatry and therapy services via telehealth. Addresses severe rural behavioral health workforce shortage.

Each hub receives telehealth gap assessment identifying needed capabilities. RHTP funds equipment, software, technical assistance, and provider training.

### Remote Patient Monitoring

For high-risk chronic disease patients and postpartum mothers:

**Device distribution**: Blood pressure monitors, glucometers, pulse oximeters, and weight scales with automated data transmission.

**Clinical protocols**: Algorithms for alert thresholds, care team response to out-of-range values, and patient education on device use.

**Care coordination**: Integration with care management programs, ensuring monitoring data reaches care team, and proactive outreach when values deteriorate.

Remote monitoring enables early intervention before emergency presentation. **Reduces travel burden** for stable chronic disease patients who otherwise require frequent in-person visits.

### Cybersecurity Enhancement

Rural facilities face elevated cybersecurity risk due to limited IT sophistication and resource constraints. Recent high-profile ransomware attacks on rural hospitals demonstrate vulnerability.

**Security assessments**: Vulnerability scanning for all participating facilities, penetration testing for larger hospitals, and risk prioritization based on assessment findings.

**Technical controls**: Firewall upgrades, intrusion detection systems, multi-factor authentication deployment, and regular security patching protocols.

**Training and protocols**: Staff cybersecurity awareness training, incident response planning, and data backup procedures.

**Managed security services**: For small facilities lacking IT staff, RHTP funds managed security service contracts providing 24/7 monitoring and incident response.

## Social Care Integration

### SDOH/HRSN Initiatives

California's RHTP application includes **explicit social determinants of health (SDOH) screening requirements** integrated with clinical transformation:

**Screening Requirements**
- Standardized SDOH screening using PRAPARE or equivalent at all network primary care sites
- Annual rescreening for Medi-Cal beneficiaries per CalAIM requirements
- Pediatric screening at well-child visits
- Screening data captured in EHR and transmitted to HIE

**HRSN Navigation and Coordination**
- Care coordination staff at hub facilities to manage social need referrals
- Integration with CalAIM Enhanced Care Management for complex cases
- Warm handoffs to community-based organizations for housing, food, transportation
- Closed-loop referral tracking through Community Information Exchange

**Funding Allocation**: Approximately **$4-6 million** for SDOH screening infrastructure, training, and data systems integration, embedded within technology and care coordination budgets rather than a distinct line item.

### Community Health Worker Programs

CHW deployment is a **distinct initiative** within workforce development:

**Proposed CHW Deployment**
- 200+ CHW certifications over five years
- Perinatal CHWs in regions with high maternal mortality (Central Valley, rural border areas)
- Chronic disease CHWs for diabetes and hypertension management
- Behavioral health CHWs for substance use disorder navigation

**CHW Employer and Supervision Structure**
- County health departments serve as primary employers in most regions
- FQHCs employ CHWs in areas with strong community health center presence
- Clinical supervision through RN care coordinators at hub facilities
- Community supervision through CBO partnerships

**Funding Allocation**: **$8-12 million** across five years for CHW training, certification, salary support, and supervision infrastructure.

**Geographic Deployment Priorities**
1. Central Valley agricultural communities (high immigrant population, language barriers)
2. Northern California tribal communities
3. Eastern Sierra frontier areas
4. Inland Empire border regions

### Community Information Exchange and Referral Platforms

California requests funding for **closed-loop referral system expansion** building on CalAIM Community Supports infrastructure:

**Platform Status**
- CalAIM already requires managed care plans to contract with Community Information Exchange platforms
- Unite Us operates in portions of California through managed care plan contracts
- Findhelp (formerly Aunt Bertha) provides resource directory in some regions
- 211 systems vary by county in sophistication and integration

**RHTP Procurement Approach**

**Social care metrics**: SDOH screening rates, closed-loop referral completion, CHW encounter volume

### Two-Year Obligation Requirement Compliance

California's spending plan ensures FY2026 funds are **obligated by FY2028**:
- Year 1: Network formation, infrastructure investment, recruitment incentives
- Year 2: Full operations, technology scaling, workforce expansion
- Carryforward provisions for multi-year contracts within spending timeline

## What the Plan Assumes

### Explicit Assumptions in State Application

- Existing CalAIM infrastructure provides foundation for rapid deployment
- Hub-spoke model creates sustainable economies of scale
- Technology adequately substitutes for in-person specialist care
- Managed care plans will invest in rural value-based arrangements
- Workforce incentives can compete with urban compensation

### Implicit Assumptions Not Stated

- Rural providers will collaborate despite competitive history
- State budget will sustain investment beyond RHTP
- Medicaid cuts will not overwhelm transformation gains
- Technology adoption will proceed smoothly across diverse facilities
- Social care components justify investment relative to clinical priorities

### Dependencies on External Factors

- **Broadband availability**: Technology initiatives require connectivity RHTP cannot directly fund
- **Managed care plan participation**: Not contractually required, depends on demonstrated value
- **Political continuity**: Administration change could shift priorities
- **Federal policy stability**: Additional Medicaid cuts could further strain system

### Risks Acknowledged Versus Ignored

**Acknowledged risks**:
- Timeline pressure from two-year spending requirement
- Workforce competition with urban markets
- Network formation challenges in frontier areas

**Underacknowledged risks**:
- Managed care plan disengagement post-2030
- Social care component vulnerability to funding triage
- Technology maintenance costs beyond RHTP period
- Political attention shifting away from rural health

## Regional Variation and Local Adaptation

California's RHTP implementation varies substantially by region:

**Northern California (Cascade/Shasta region)**: Smaller population, greater distances, emphasis on hub-spoke efficiency, tribal health integration critical, and workforce recruitment especially challenging.

**Central Valley**: Larger rural population, agricultural workforce considerations, high Medi-Cal enrollment, FQHC infrastructure to leverage, and maternity care access priority.

**Eastern Sierra/High Desert**: Extreme geography, frontier designation for many areas, tourism-related seasonal demand, limited existing infrastructure, and technology solutions essential.

**North Coast**: Isolated communities, limited road access in some areas, timber industry economic base, behavioral health and substance use disorder prevalence, and tribal health systems.

Each region receives **tailored implementation** based on local assessment. The statewide framework provides consistency, but execution adapts to regional reality.

## Conclusion

California's RHTP plan is fundamentally a **leverage strategy**. Rather than building new infrastructure from scratch, the state layers RHTP funding onto existing CalAIM programs, deploys proven care extension models like Project ECHO, expands the statewide health information exchange to rural areas, and creates hub-and-spoke networks that extend specialist expertise through technology.

The three initiatives work interdependently. Hub-and-spoke networks require telehealth technology. Workforce programs recruit to network facilities. Technology enables team-based care with expanded provider roles. Payment reform funds the transition. **Social care integration threads through all three**, with CHW deployment, SDOH screening, and CIE platforms creating whole-person care infrastructure.

The plan is **sophisticated and comprehensive**. It addresses the six challenges identified in Part 1: stabilizing infrastructure through Transformative Payments, building workforce pipelines, deploying technology infrastructure, creating regional networks, integrating with CalAIM, and designing for sustainability through value-based payment transition.

Whether the plan can work is a different question. Part 3 addresses implementation challenges, what survives under funding constraints, whether social care components survive partial funding reality, and whether the fundamental premise holds: **can $86.52 per rural resident catalyze transformation that sustains beyond 2030?**

The stakes are what they were in Part 1: 2.7 million rural Californians need healthcare access. California has built a plan that looks credible on paper. **Implementation will determine whether it transforms reality**.
