# RHTP 9.M
# Substance Use Disorder
## Treatment Deserts and the Workforce That Cannot Come

Substance use disorder is a medical condition with evidence-based treatment. Rural America has high SUD prevalence and minimal treatment infrastructure. **The treatment gap is not population choice but system failure.** Providers do not exist. Medications are not available. Treatment philosophy in many communities still contradicts decades of evidence favoring medication-assisted treatment. RHTP applications universally acknowledge the opioid crisis and promise treatment expansion, yet the workforce constraints and community attitudes that created treatment deserts persist regardless of federal investment.

This article examines rural populations with substance use disorder not as a disease category but as a population experiencing healthcare system discrimination. The core tension is whether poor outcomes reflect population characteristics or system failures. Both perspectives contain truth: SUD does involve individual behavior, and systems do discriminate against people with addiction. Understanding how these factors interact matters for intervention design. Universal transformation approaches that treat SUD as simply another chronic condition to manage miss how stigma, policy, and economics have constructed treatment deserts that would not be tolerated for any other medical condition.

**SUD is not a homogeneous category.** The 45-year-old construction worker dependent on opioids after a workplace injury faces different circumstances than the 22-year-old with methamphetamine use disorder seeking identity and escape. Alcohol use disorder, the most prevalent SUD, receives even less policy attention than opioids despite causing more total harm. Polysubstance use increasingly characterizes rural SUD populations, complicating treatment that was designed for single-substance disorders. This within-population diversity matters for intervention, yet RHTP applications treat SUD as primarily an opioid problem requiring a medication-assisted treatment solution.

## Population Profile

Substance use disorder prevalence in rural America has shifted dramatically over the past two decades. The opioid epidemic that began with prescription painkillers transitioned through heroin to synthetic fentanyl, each transition increasing lethality. Methamphetamine resurged across rural regions, particularly in the West and Midwest. Alcohol use disorder persists as the most common SUD while receiving the least policy attention.

**The 2024 National Survey on Drug Use and Health** reports that approximately 3.2 million rural adults meet criteria for substance use disorder, representing roughly 7.8% of the adult nonmetropolitan population. This prevalence rate now exceeds urban rates for several substance categories after years of approximate parity.

Overdose mortality tells the starkest story. **Rural overdose death rates exceeded urban rates beginning in 2015 and the gap has widened.** CDC data through 2024 shows age-adjusted drug overdose death rates of 35.2 per 100,000 in rural areas compared to 29.8 per 100,000 in urban areas. The rural disadvantage concentrates in Appalachia, the rural Southwest, and agricultural regions of the Midwest and Great Plains.

The demographic composition of rural SUD populations differs from urban patterns. Rural opioid use disorder skews older and more likely to have originated with prescription opioids rather than illicit use. Rural methamphetamine use includes higher proportions of white populations and agricultural workers. Alcohol use disorder affects all rural demographics but receives minimal targeted intervention.

**Geographic isolation shapes both SUD development and treatment access.** Rural residents experiencing social isolation, economic distress, and limited opportunity may use substances to cope with circumstances that substance use then worsens. When they seek treatment, geographic barriers compound the same isolation that contributed to disorder development. The cycle is structural, not simply behavioral.

## Health Status and Access

Rural populations with SUD face dramatically worse outcomes than both urban SUD populations and general rural populations. The disparity reflects not disease severity but treatment availability. Evidence-based treatment exists. Rural areas simply do not have it.

**Population Experience Analysis**

| Measure | Rural SUD Population | Urban SUD Population | Gap | Data Source |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------|-----|-------------|
| Overdose death rate (per 100,000) | 35.2 | 29.8 | +5.4 | CDC WONDER 2024 |
| Counties without MAT prescriber | 58.2% | 8.4% | +49.8% | SAMHSA Locator 2025 |
| Distance to nearest OTP (median miles) | 74 | 8 | +66 | SAMHSA OTP Directory 2024 |
| Treatment gap (need vs. receipt) | 89.4% | 78.2% | +11.2% | NSDUH 2024 |
| Wait time for residential treatment (weeks) | 4.8 | 2.1 | +2.7 | SAMHSA Treatment Locator 2024 |
| Buprenorphine prescribers per 10,000 | 1.2 | 4.8 | -3.6 | DEA Waiver Database 2024 |
| Naloxone distribution (doses per OD death) | 12.4 | 28.7 | -16.3 | State Health Department Data 2024 |
| SUD treatment facilities per 100,000 | 3.8 | 9.2 | -5.4 | SAMHSA NSSATS 2024 |
| Medicaid coverage for MAT | 89% | 94% | -5% | KFF State Medicaid Data 2024 |
| Same-day treatment availability | 12.3% | 34.7% | -22.4% | SAMHSA Treatment Gap Report 2024 |

The data reveals systematic exclusion from effective treatment. **Nearly 90% of rural residents meeting SUD criteria do not receive treatment.** The gap is not primarily about willingness. When treatment is available and accessible, rural populations engage at rates comparable to urban populations. The gap is access, not motivation.

## The Core Tension: Population Characteristics vs. System Discrimination

The dominant policy framing presents SUD as a medical condition requiring medical intervention. This framing correctly identifies that SUD responds to treatment and that treatment produces better outcomes than incarceration or abstinence-only approaches. But medical framing obscures a harder question: **why does medical treatment not exist for this medical condition?**

**The Population Characteristics View** holds that SUD outcomes reflect disease complexity and population behavior. Addiction involves relapse as a feature, not a failure. Treatment resistance, ambivalence about recovery, and continued use despite consequences characterize the disorder. Rural SUD populations may face additional barriers including limited transportation, employment demands, and cultural stigma that reduce treatment engagement. Poor outcomes reflect disease characteristics interacting with environmental challenges, not system failure.

**The System Discrimination View** holds that SUD treatment absence reflects discrimination against people with addiction. **Communities that would never tolerate the absence of diabetes treatment accept the absence of addiction treatment.** Stigma drives policy: treatment facilities face NIMBY opposition that would be illegal for other healthcare facilities. Providers face reimbursement penalties that discourage addiction medicine specialization. Patients face discrimination in employment, housing, and child custody that penalizes treatment-seeking. The treatment desert is constructed through policy choices, not natural resource distribution.

Evidence supports the system discrimination view. Treatment effectiveness for SUD, particularly with medication-assisted treatment, matches or exceeds effectiveness for other chronic conditions. **MAT reduces opioid use by 50-80%, decreases overdose deaths, and improves retention in treatment at rates comparable to insulin for diabetes or antihypertensives for cardiovascular disease.** The difference is not evidence. The difference is that health systems treat diabetes as medical and addiction as moral.

The practical implication: interventions focused solely on expanding medical treatment capacity will underperform unless they also address the discrimination that prevents treatment infrastructure development. Building a MAT clinic requires not just funding but overcoming zoning opposition, provider reluctance, and community hostility that other medical facilities do not face.

## The Rural SUD Reality

### Opioid Crisis Evolution

The opioid epidemic reached rural America through prescription painkillers before transitioning to illicit opioids. Initial prescribing patterns in the 1990s and 2000s targeted rural populations with high rates of workplace injuries, chronic pain conditions, and limited access to multimodal pain management. Rural patients received more opioid prescriptions per capita than urban patients, creating larger populations with physical dependence.

When prescribing restrictions tightened after 2010, dependent populations transitioned first to heroin and then to synthetic fentanyl. **Each transition increased lethality while decreasing the effectiveness of harm reduction.** Fentanyl's potency means overdose risk exists even for experienced users who miscalculate doses or encounter unexpectedly concentrated supply. Naloxone reversal remains effective but requires faster response times that rural emergency services cannot consistently provide.

Geographic distribution of the opioid crisis has shifted. Early concentration in Appalachia and the rural Northeast has spread to agricultural regions of the Great Plains, the rural Southwest, and previously low-prevalence areas. No rural region remains untouched.

### Methamphetamine Resurgence

Methamphetamine use declined in the mid-2000s as precursor restrictions disrupted domestic production. The resurgence beginning around 2010 brought cheaper, more potent product from Mexican production that circumvented domestic precursor controls. Rural methamphetamine availability now exceeds pre-restriction levels at lower prices.

**Rural methamphetamine use differs from opioid patterns in ways that complicate treatment.** Methamphetamine has no FDA-approved medication-assisted treatment equivalent to buprenorphine for opioids. Behavioral treatments exist but require sustained engagement that geographic access barriers undermine. The stimulant high differs from opioid sedation in ways that affect work capacity, leading some rural workers to perceive methamphetamine as functional rather than problematic.

### Alcohol Use Disorder

Alcohol remains the most prevalent substance use disorder in rural America while receiving the least targeted policy attention. **Alcohol use disorder affects approximately 11% of rural adults who drink, comparable to or exceeding urban rates.** Alcohol-related liver disease, alcohol-related motor vehicle deaths, and alcohol-related domestic violence all show elevated rural rates.

The policy neglect reflects several factors. Alcohol is legal. Alcohol industries have political power. Alcohol problems lack the crisis narrative that attracted opioid attention. Yet alcohol causes more total rural health harm than any single illegal substance. RHTP applications rarely mention alcohol-specific interventions.

### Polysubstance Use

Contemporary rural SUD increasingly involves multiple substances. Opioid users consume methamphetamine to counteract sedation. Methamphetamine users consume opioids to manage comedowns. Both groups consume alcohol. **Polysubstance use complicates treatment protocols designed for single-substance disorders** and increases overdose risk through drug interactions.

Treatment systems organized around specific substances struggle with polysubstance presentations. A patient needs both MAT for opioid use disorder and behavioral treatment for methamphetamine use disorder, but treatment facilities often specialize in one or the other. Integration exists in theory; segregation persists in practice.

## Treatment Infrastructure Absence

Rural SUD treatment infrastructure has collapsed even as prevalence increased. The facilities that serve rural populations are often distant, limited in capacity, and unable to provide the full continuum of care that evidence supports.

### MAT Provider Scarcity

Medication-assisted treatment represents the most effective intervention for opioid use disorder, yet MAT provider distribution excludes most rural communities. **The 2016 Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act and subsequent 2023 elimination of DATA 2000 waiver requirements removed regulatory barriers to MAT prescribing.** Any DEA-registered practitioner can now prescribe buprenorphine without special certification.

Practical barriers persist despite regulatory flexibility. **Rural primary care providers remain reluctant to prescribe** due to concerns about practice disruption, patient complexity, inadequate behavioral health support, and community stigma. Some providers fear that treating addiction will transform their patient panel in ways they cannot manage. Others face informal pressure from communities that do not want addiction treatment in their town.

The result: more than half of rural counties have no MAT prescriber despite regulatory changes that supposedly enabled universal prescribing. The barrier was never primarily regulatory. The barrier is provider willingness in a context of inadequate support and active community resistance.

### Residential Treatment Distance

Intensive treatment requiring residential placement requires rural patients to travel far from home. The average rural patient requiring residential treatment faces a 300+ mile journey to available beds, with wait times exceeding one month for facilities that accept their insurance or can provide charity care.

**Treatment motivation is time-limited.** A patient ready for treatment on Tuesday may not be ready when a bed becomes available in six weeks. The window of willingness closes. The distance and delay that characterize rural treatment access convert potential successes into predictable failures.

### Outpatient Treatment Gaps

Less intensive outpatient treatment exists in more rural communities than residential options, but availability remains limited. Many rural counties have no outpatient SUD treatment facility. Where facilities exist, wait times for initial appointments extend weeks. Individual counseling may be available while group therapy, the more cost-effective format, requires patient volumes that rural populations cannot generate.

The counseling available often lacks MAT integration. **Evidence strongly supports combining medication and counseling for opioid use disorder.** Counseling alone produces worse outcomes than MAT alone; MAT with counseling produces best outcomes. Yet rural patients often can access only counseling, receiving the least effective component of evidence-based treatment.

### Recovery Support Absence

Peer recovery support, the infrastructure that helps maintain recovery after initial treatment, barely exists in rural America. Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous meetings may occur but require driving distances that strain recovery itself. Professional recovery coaches and peer support specialists concentrate in urban areas. The mutual aid networks that sustain long-term recovery cannot achieve the density that makes them accessible.

**The absence of recovery support converts treatment success into eventual relapse.** A patient who achieves initial recovery in distant residential treatment returns to a home community with no ongoing support. Relapse is not failure of willpower. Relapse is predictable outcome of treating acute episodes without addressing chronic condition management.

**Maria Torres came back to Crockett County, Texas to help her mother.**

At 34, she had been clean for two years in San Antonio, attending NA meetings three times a week, working as a restaurant manager, building something. Her mother's stroke brought her home to Ozona, population 3,200, where she had first tried meth at 17 and spent her twenties cycling between use, jail, and failed attempts at recovery.

Crockett County has no SUD treatment. No counseling. No support groups. The nearest NA meeting is 90 miles in San Angelo; her mother needs care, so Maria cannot make the drive regularly. The nearest MAT provider for the opioids she also used is in Midland, two hours north. She tried telehealth counseling but dropped out because talking to a screen in her childhood bedroom felt like therapy tourism from a place that did not understand why someone would come back to Ozona.

Maria relapsed eight months after returning. Not dramatically, not all at once, but the way rural relapse often happens: isolation becomes boredom becomes contact with old connections becomes use. Her mother needs more care than Maria can provide while using, but Maria cannot access care without leaving her mother alone.

She called SAMHSA's helpline once. They gave her treatment options in San Antonio, Houston, Austin. Nothing closer. When she said she could not leave her mother, the counselor suggested family support services, which Crockett County does not have either.

"They act like treatment is available and I'm just not taking it," Maria said. "I would take it. There's nothing to take."

## RHTP Relevance

**How RHTP Addresses SUD Populations**

| State | SUD-Specific Provisions | Funding Allocated | Implementation Approach |
|-------|------------------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Kentucky | Mobile response teams, MAT in CAHs, EmPATH units | $35-40 million | Crisis continuum + treatment expansion |
| West Virginia | Hub-and-spoke MAT, RCORP integration, peer support | $30-35 million | Regional treatment network |
| Vermont | Existing hub-and-spoke enhancement, CCBHC expansion | $15-20 million | Build on established infrastructure |
| Ohio | MAT in primary care, quick response teams, drug court | $25-30 million | Multiple entry points + diversion |
| New Mexico | Tribal SUD services, border region focus, telehealth MAT | $20-25 million | Population-specific targeting |
| Oklahoma | MAT prescriber training, naloxone distribution, recovery housing | $15-20 million | Workforce + harm reduction |

**Gap Assessment**

RHTP provides meaningful SUD investment in states with existing infrastructure to build upon. Vermont's hub-and-spoke model, the national exemplar for rural OUD treatment, receives enhancement funding to extend already-functioning systems. Kentucky's EmPATH expansion builds on demonstrated success in Lexington.

**RHTP fails populations in states starting from infrastructure absence.** Texas receives minimal per-capita RHTP funding and proposes no SUD treatment system that could reach rural communities like Crockett County. Mississippi's application mentions SUD but provides no specific treatment infrastructure plan. States where the crisis is most severe often have the least capacity to respond.

The universal approach creates another gap: **RHTP treats SUD as primarily an opioid problem because that is where federal attention and evidence have concentrated.** Methamphetamine receives minimal specific intervention. Alcohol use disorder receives almost none. Polysubstance use, increasingly the norm, falls between categorical treatment approaches.

## Alternative Perspective: The System Discrimination View

The system discrimination perspective holds that **SUD treatment absence is constructed through deliberate policy choices, not natural resource scarcity.** Every element of the treatment desert reflects decisions that could be made differently.

The evidence for constructed scarcity is substantial. Treatment facilities face zoning and permitting barriers that other healthcare facilities do not face. Communities mobilize against addiction treatment in their neighborhoods using legal mechanisms unavailable for opposition to other medical services. States have historically excluded SUD treatment from Medicaid coverage or imposed restrictions not applied to other conditions. Insurance plans have applied prior authorization and utilization management requirements more stringently for SUD than for conditions with comparable evidence bases.

**Provider supply reflects economic discrimination.** Addiction medicine pays less than other specialties requiring equivalent training. Rural addiction medicine pays least of all. The physicians, nurse practitioners, and counselors who would provide treatment choose specialties and locations that do not penalize their career choices. The workforce absence is economic signal, not educational failure.

Discrimination also operates through treatment philosophy. **Abstinence-only approaches remain common despite overwhelming evidence favoring MAT.** Some treatment programs, including those that criminal justice systems mandate, prohibit medications that constitute standard of care. Patients who would benefit from evidence-based treatment instead receive ideology-based treatment that evidence shows does not work. This would be malpractice for any other condition.

**Assessment of the Discrimination View**

The discrimination perspective accurately identifies policy choices that shape treatment availability. Changing these policies could increase access: reforming zoning restrictions, achieving payment parity, requiring evidence-based treatment in publicly funded programs.

But the discrimination view may overstate the ease of reform. Community attitudes toward addiction reflect cultural values that policy cannot quickly change. Provider reluctance persists even after regulatory barriers fall. Economic incentives work slowly. Stigma is more durable than policy.

The practical implication: **RHTP alone cannot overcome discriminatory structures that extend beyond healthcare policy.** Treatment expansion requires simultaneous attention to housing, employment, criminal justice, and social attitudes that affect SUD populations beyond clinical settings. States treating SUD as purely medical problem, solvable through provider training and telehealth, will achieve less than states addressing discrimination across systems.

## State and Regional Variation

**Why SUD Population Experience Varies**

| Factor | How It Affects Rural SUD | State/Regional Examples |
|--------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| Medicaid expansion | Determines coverage for MAT and counseling | Expanded (VT, KY) vs. non-expansion (TX, WI) |
| Hub-and-spoke development | Creates treatment network or leaves fragmentation | Vermont model vs. no-system states |
| Criminal justice orientation | Diverts to treatment or incarcerates | Drug court states vs. prosecution-focused |
| Opioid litigation settlement use | Directs resources or dissipates funding | States with SUD allocation requirements vs. general fund |
| Provider training culture | Creates or discourages MAT prescribing | Strong medical school focus vs. abstinence tradition |
| Stigma environment | Affects treatment-seeking and community acceptance | Progressive communities vs. moralistic orientation |

Regional patterns reveal that **Medicaid expansion states have substantially better SUD treatment access than non-expansion states.** The coverage gap directly translates into treatment availability: Medicaid pays for MAT, and MAT providers locate where payment exists. Non-expansion states that rejected coverage expansion also rejected treatment infrastructure development.

Opioid litigation settlements represent a potential transformation opportunity. **Billions of dollars are flowing to states and localities from manufacturer and distributor settlements.** Some states have required that settlement funds support SUD treatment and prevention. Others have allowed diversion to general funds or non-SUD purposes. The states that direct settlement resources to treatment infrastructure may achieve the capacity gains that RHTP alone cannot produce.

**Two Counties, One State, Different Outcomes**

Jefferson County, Tennessee and Scott County, Tennessee both have populations around 50,000. Both experienced opioid crisis devastation. Both are rural Appalachian communities with limited healthcare infrastructure.

Jefferson County received RCORP (Rural Communities Opioid Response Program) funding in 2019 that developed a hub-and-spoke MAT network. The Jefferson Memorial Hospital emergency department now initiates buprenorphine for patients presenting with overdose or seeking treatment. Five primary care practices serve as spokes providing ongoing MAT. A peer recovery coach program provides community support. Overdose deaths have declined 40% since 2019.

Scott County received no RCORP funding and has no MAT network. The county has no buprenorphine prescriber. Patients seeking treatment must travel to Knoxville, 45 miles through mountain roads. The hospital emergency department stabilizes overdoses and discharges without treatment connection. Overdose deaths have increased 15% over the same period.

**The difference is not population. The difference is infrastructure.** Jefferson County has treatment because grant funding built treatment. Scott County lacks treatment because no funding built treatment. The patients are similar. The outcomes diverge based on system capacity, not individual characteristics.

## Intersectionality Considerations

**How SUD Population Intersects With Others**

| Intersecting Population | Compound Effect | Estimated Size |
|------------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Rural veterans with SUD | VA access gaps + civilian treatment absence | 380,000 |
| Appalachian SUD | Geographic isolation + economic despair + family disruption | 520,000 |
| Justice-involved with SUD | Incarceration interrupts treatment + reentry without access | 450,000 |
| Tribal SUD populations | Historical trauma + IHS limitations + jurisdiction complexity | 180,000 |
| SUD with serious mental illness | Dual diagnosis requires integrated treatment that rarely exists | 890,000 |
| Pregnant women with SUD | Criminalization risk + treatment access prioritization | 45,000 |
| Agricultural workers with SUD | Seasonal work patterns + documentation barriers | 120,000 |

**Intersection with serious mental illness** represents the largest compound challenge. More than half of individuals with SUD have co-occurring mental health conditions. More than half of individuals with serious mental illness have co-occurring SUD. Yet treatment systems remain largely separate. Mental health programs may not address SUD. SUD programs may not address mental health. **The patient with both conditions often receives treatment for neither because neither system is equipped for integrated care.**

Justice involvement creates particularly destructive intersection effects. Incarceration interrupts treatment and often prohibits MAT even for patients stable on medication. Release without treatment connection produces predictable relapse. Reincarceration follows. **The criminal justice system cycles SUD populations through institutional contact without achieving either punishment's deterrent goals or treatment's recovery goals.**

## What Transformation Requires

**What RHTP Can Provide**
- MAT prescriber training and support for willing providers
- Hub-and-spoke network development in states with hub infrastructure
- Telehealth MAT services where broadband exists
- Integration of SUD treatment into primary care and emergency settings
- Peer recovery coach workforce development
- Naloxone distribution expansion

**What RHTP Cannot Provide**
- Immediate workforce creation in treatment deserts
- Community attitude change regarding addiction
- Resolution of substance supply driving overdose deaths
- Housing and employment support beyond health system scope
- Criminal justice reform enabling treatment over incarceration
- Prevention addressing root causes of substance use

The gap between what transformation requires and what RHTP can provide reveals **structural limitations of healthcare-focused investment for a problem that extends beyond healthcare.** SUD populations need treatment, but they also need housing that does not exclude people in recovery, employment that accommodates treatment schedules, communities that accept rather than stigmatize, and legal systems that divert rather than incarcerate.

RHTP investments in SUD treatment infrastructure represent necessary but insufficient intervention. States that treat RHTP SUD funding as complete response will discover that treatment without social support produces limited gains. States that coordinate RHTP with opioid settlement funds, housing investments, and criminal justice reform have pathways to meaningful transformation.

## Conclusion

Rural populations with substance use disorder face a constructed treatment desert. The infrastructure absence reflects policy choices about what healthcare systems will treat, where providers will locate, and how communities will respond to addiction. These choices can be changed, but RHTP alone cannot change them.

**The evidence supports a sobering assessment.** Medication-assisted treatment works. Hub-and-spoke networks extend treatment access. Peer support improves recovery maintenance. The interventions that transform SUD outcomes exist and can be implemented in rural settings. What cannot be implemented within RHTP timelines is the cultural shift that would enable treatment infrastructure to develop in communities that do not want it.

States with existing SUD treatment infrastructure will use RHTP to expand functioning systems. Vermont will extend its hub-and-spoke model to reach more patients. Kentucky will build EmPATH units that connect crisis response to treatment. These investments will improve outcomes for populations that can access enhanced services.

States without existing infrastructure face a harder path. Building treatment networks from nothing requires more than funding. It requires willing providers, accepting communities, and coordinated systems that do not exist in treatment deserts. **RHTP can fund what states propose. It cannot create the conditions that would make proposals viable in communities starting from zero.**

The honest assessment: RHTP will help some rural SUD populations in some states while leaving others in treatment deserts that existed before federal investment and will persist after. This is not program failure. This is policy confronting structural constraints that program design cannot overcome.
