# RHTP 9.TD.B: Exemption and Accommodation Frameworks

*Series 9: Special Populations*

RHTP provides universal funding and guidance for rural health transformation. Universal approaches offer consistency, simplicity, and equity of treatment across populations. They also fail populations whose circumstances make standard approaches unworkable. **The question is not whether to accommodate but when, for whom, and through what mechanisms.**

This technical document establishes the framework for determining which populations require specific RHTP accommodations versus which can be adequately served through standard approaches. The framework emerges from patterns identified across Series 9 population articles. Tribal sovereignty requires fundamentally different engagement than demographic targeting. Farmworker mobility requires continuity mechanisms that static systems cannot provide. Frontier isolation requires delivery models that conventional infrastructure cannot support. Each population's distinct circumstances determine what accommodation, if any, transformation must provide.

The framework serves state RHTP planners who must translate universal program language into implementation that reaches populations with distinct needs. It provides decision criteria, accommodation typologies, and implementation guidance. It also acknowledges limits: **accommodation adds complexity and cost**. Unlimited accommodation fragments programs into categorical silos that serve administrative requirements rather than whole people. The goal is principled accommodation, not accommodation as default.

## The Accommodation Question

### Why Universal Approaches Fail

RHTP's design reflects reasonable assumptions about healthcare delivery: populations can access facilities, providers can serve populations within geographic reach, administrative systems can identify and track beneficiaries, standard delivery models can meet most needs. These assumptions hold for many rural populations. They fail systematically for populations whose circumstances place them outside the boundaries where standard approaches work.

**Frontier populations** cannot access facilities when the nearest facility is three hours away. Standard infrastructure strengthening becomes meaningless when no population base exists to sustain infrastructure.

**Farmworkers** cannot be tracked through administrative systems when they move across state lines monthly, use different names in different locations, and avoid documentation that might reveal immigration status.

**Tribal members** cannot receive care through state-administered programs when their legal and political status exists outside state jurisdiction, their health system operates through federal government-to-government relationships, and their sovereignty precludes state direction of their healthcare.

**Veterans** have earned healthcare through a dedicated federal system that operates independently of state programs. RHTP can strengthen community hospitals, but it cannot make those hospitals understand military trauma or connect to VA benefits systems.

**Justice-involved individuals** lose Medicaid coverage upon incarceration and must navigate re-enrollment upon release, often without documentation, stable address, or understanding of available programs. Standard enrollment processes assume stability that reentry does not provide.

These failures are not design flaws correctable through better implementation. They reflect **structural mismatches** between universal program assumptions and population circumstances that contradict those assumptions. Accommodation addresses the mismatch.

### Why Unlimited Accommodation Fails

The opposite error treats every population as requiring specific accommodation. This produces:

**Fragmentation:** Separate programs for each population create administrative silos. A person who is simultaneously elderly, veteran, diabetic, and living in a persistent poverty county might qualify for multiple categorical programs without any single program seeing the whole person.

**Complexity:** Each accommodation requires distinct eligibility criteria, reporting requirements, and accountability mechanisms. State administrative capacity cannot support unlimited complexity.

**Equity concerns:** Populations with political visibility secure accommodations while invisible populations receive standard treatment regardless of need.

**Implementation impossibility:** RHTP runs through 2030 with finite resources. Attempting specific accommodation for every population with distinct circumstances exhausts resources on program design rather than service delivery.

The framework below provides decision criteria that distinguish populations requiring accommodation from those adequately served through standard approaches.

## Accommodation Decision Framework

The decision tree below identifies characteristics that trigger accommodation need. Populations exhibiting these characteristics cannot be adequately served through standard RHTP approaches. The framework operates as a screening tool, not a prescription. **States must apply judgment to local circumstances rather than mechanically applying national criteria.**

### Decision Tree

| Screening Question | If Yes | If No | Rationale |
|-------------------|--------|-------|-----------|
| **Does population have a dedicated healthcare system (VA, IHS)?** | Coordination approach required | Proceed to next question | Dedicated systems require partnership, not replacement. Duplication wastes resources and confuses beneficiaries. |
| **Does population have legal status that precludes standard enrollment?** | Documentation-sensitive design required | Proceed to next question | Undocumented populations cannot access programs requiring citizenship verification. Alternative pathways or exemptions necessary. |
| **Does population experience mobility that breaks geographic continuity?** | Portable services/records required | Proceed to next question | Static systems cannot serve mobile populations. Cross-jurisdiction mechanisms necessary. |
| **Does population face geographic extremity preventing facility access?** | Alternative delivery models required | Proceed to next question | Facility-based care cannot reach populations hours from any facility. Different delivery paradigms necessary. |
| **Does population face historical discrimination affecting trust and access?** | Equity-focused investment required | Proceed to next question | Standard approaches may perpetuate rather than address historical patterns. Intentional equity design necessary. |
| **Does condition require specialty expertise unavailable locally?** | Hub-and-spoke or telehealth models required | Proceed to next question | Primary care strengthening cannot address specialty absence. Referral networks and remote access necessary. |
| **Does population experience stigma affecting help-seeking?** | Stigma-reducing access design required | Standard approaches may suffice | Standard systems that require self-identification may be avoided by stigmatized populations. Alternative access points necessary. |

### Applying the Framework

Most populations trigger one or two screening questions. Populations triggering multiple questions require **compound accommodations** that address each triggered characteristic. The intersectionality documented in TD-A produces compound accommodation requirements documented here.

**Example: Tribal Elder with Diabetes**

| Screening Question | Triggered? | Accommodation Implication |
|-------------------|------------|---------------------------|
| Dedicated system? | Yes (IHS) | VA coordination not relevant; IHS coordination required |
| Legal status barrier? | No | Standard enrollment acceptable |
| Geographic mobility? | No | Static residence assumed |
| Geographic extremity? | Often yes | Many reservations meet frontier criteria; alternative delivery may apply |
| Historical discrimination? | Yes | Colonial history, boarding schools, broken treaties require equity-focused approach |
| Specialty need? | Yes | Diabetes management requires endocrinology access unavailable on most reservations |
| Stigma? | Varies | Cultural factors may affect health-seeking for some conditions |

This individual triggers four screening questions: dedicated system, geographic extremity, historical discrimination, and specialty need. Standard RHTP approaches cannot adequately serve this person. **The required accommodation combines IHS coordination, alternative delivery for frontier access, equity-focused investment recognizing historical context, and hub-and-spoke specialty access for diabetes management.**

## Accommodation Types by Population

The table below specifies accommodation types required for each Series 9 population based on framework application. Accommodation types are not mutually exclusive; populations may require multiple accommodation approaches.

| Population | Primary Accommodation Type | Secondary Accommodations | Implementation Mechanism |
|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Rural Elderly** | Infrastructure investment | Workforce development, transportation | Standard RHTP with geriatric emphasis; no fundamental accommodation required |
| **Tribal/Indigenous** | Sovereignty respect | IHS coordination, cultural safety | Government-to-government consultation; tribal set-asides; IHS-state compacts |
| **Frontier** | Alternative delivery models | Telehealth priority, community health aide | FAR-specific flexibilities; CHAP-style programs; non-facility reimbursement |
| **Farmworkers** | Portability | Documentation sensitivity, seasonal scheduling | Multi-state record systems; FQHC migrant health programs; documentation-neutral enrollment |
| **Persistent Poverty** | Equity-focused investment | SDOH integration, sustained commitment | Enhanced funding formulas; multi-generational planning; SDOH requirements |
| **Post-Industrial** | Economic transition support | Workforce retraining, mental health integration | Standard RHTP; no fundamental accommodation required |
| **Black Belt/Delta** | Historical discrimination redress | Infrastructure rebuild, equity investment | Enhanced funding; accountability for disparity reduction; community-controlled investment |
| **Appalachian** | Community-centered design | Substance use integration, trust-building | Community health worker emphasis; peer support; locally-controlled programs |
| **Border** | Binational recognition | Documentation sensitivity, continuity across border | Recognition of cross-border health patterns; documentation-neutral access where legal |
| **Veterans** | System coordination | Community care integration, military-competent providers | VA-RHTP care compacts; veteran identification in RHTP systems; MISSION Act alignment |
| **Children** | Developmental investment | Pediatric workforce, school-based delivery | Pediatric access requirements; school health integration; intergenerational planning |
| **Justice-Involved** | Transition continuity | Pre-release enrollment, reentry support | Medicaid suspension vs. termination; pre-release planning; reentry navigation |
| **SUD** | Treatment access | Stigma reduction, harm reduction | MAT expansion; peer support; co-occurring treatment capacity |
| **SMI** | Specialty access | Crisis services, intensive treatment | ACT teams; crisis stabilization; forensic services; telehealth psychiatry |
| **Complex Conditions** | Hub-and-spoke networks | Travel support, care coordination | Specialty referral networks; telehealth specialist access; transportation assistance |
| **Autism/IDD** | Lifespan continuity | Workforce pipeline, diagnostic access | Telehealth diagnosis pathways; parent training models; adult services infrastructure; transition planning |

### Accommodation Type Definitions

**Sovereignty Respect:** Recognition that tribal nations have government-to-government relationships with the federal government that states cannot override. Implementation requires consultation with tribal governments, respect for tribal decision-making authority, and accommodation of tribal health system structures that may differ from state approaches.

**System Coordination:** Alignment between RHTP and existing dedicated systems (VA, IHS) serving specific populations. Implementation requires data sharing agreements, care compacts, and shared protocols that enable beneficiaries to access both systems without duplication or gaps.

**Alternative Delivery Models:** Healthcare delivery mechanisms that do not depend on facility-based infrastructure. Implementation includes Community Health Aide Programs, community paramedicine, mobile health units, and intensive telehealth models designed for populations that cannot access facilities.

**Portability:** Services and records that follow mobile populations across geographic and jurisdictional boundaries. Implementation requires interstate data sharing, portable enrollment, and service models that accommodate seasonal or migratory patterns.

**Documentation Sensitivity:** Access pathways that do not require documentation status verification. Implementation may include FQHC enrollment pathways, emergency Medicaid, and state-funded programs for populations ineligible for federal benefits.

**Equity-Focused Investment:** Enhanced resource allocation and intentional design to address populations experiencing historical disadvantage. Implementation includes enhanced funding formulas, disparity reduction accountability, and community-controlled investment decisions.

**Transition Continuity:** Services designed to maintain healthcare access across life transitions (incarceration/release, pediatric/adult, school/community). Implementation requires advance planning, warm handoffs, and system bridges that prevent coverage and care gaps.

**Hub-and-Spoke Networks:** Referral systems connecting local primary care to distant specialty services through structured relationships. Implementation includes contractual arrangements, telehealth integration, and travel support enabling populations to access expertise unavailable locally.

**Stigma-Reducing Access:** Service designs that minimize barriers created by condition stigma. Implementation includes peer-delivered services, anonymous initial contacts, community-based rather than clinical settings, and integrated service delivery that does not require disclosing stigmatized conditions.

## When Universal Approaches Suffice

Not every population requires accommodation. The framework identifies populations whose circumstances do not trigger screening criteria and who can be adequately served through standard RHTP approaches.

### Populations Without Fundamental Accommodation Requirements

**Rural Elderly:** The largest rural population (9.3 million) faces significant challenges but no characteristics requiring fundamental accommodation. Standard RHTP approaches (infrastructure investment, workforce development, service expansion) can address elderly needs. The accommodation required is emphasis and prioritization, not structural program redesign.

**Caveat:** Elderly populations in frontier areas or with complex conditions may trigger additional screening questions. The general elderly population does not; specific subpopulations may.

**Post-Industrial Communities:** Economic transition communities face deindustrialization consequences including job loss, population decline, and health impacts. These challenges are severe but do not require accommodation beyond standard RHTP. Infrastructure investment, workforce development, and service expansion address community needs. The distinction from persistent poverty is that post-industrial decline is economic transition, not multi-generational structural disadvantage.

**Children (General):** Rural children face access challenges addressed through standard RHTP approaches. Pediatric workforce development, school-based services, and family support programs fit within universal frameworks. Children with specific conditions (autism, complex medical needs) may trigger specialty access accommodations, but the general child population does not require fundamental program accommodation.

**Standard Approach Effectiveness Criteria:**
- Population can access existing or planned facilities
- Population can be identified and enrolled through standard administrative processes
- Population does not face legal barriers to program participation
- Population's health needs can be met through primary care and standard specialty referral
- No dedicated healthcare system serves this population requiring coordination

### Gray Zone Populations

Some populations fall between clear accommodation requirements and clear standard approach sufficiency. State judgment must determine appropriate response.

**Appalachian Communities:** The population triggers historical discrimination (extractive industries, cultural marginalization) but may or may not require fundamental accommodation depending on specific circumstances. Some Appalachian communities retain strong social networks and community health infrastructure that standard approaches can strengthen. Others face trust deficits and cultural barriers that require accommodation. **State assessment of specific communities, not blanket regional treatment, determines appropriate approach.**

**SUD Populations:** Substance use disorder triggers stigma-related access barriers, but the degree of accommodation required varies. States with robust MAT infrastructure and integrated SUD treatment may adequately serve this population through standard approaches with targeted emphasis. States with SUD treatment deserts may require fundamental service development that goes beyond standard RHTP infrastructure.

**Mental Health Generally:** Mental health needs are prevalent across rural populations. General mental health service expansion fits within standard RHTP. Serious mental illness (SMI) requires specialty access accommodation. The distinction between general mental health and SMI determines accommodation requirements.

## Implementation Guidance

### State Assessment Process

States should assess accommodation requirements through systematic evaluation of population presence and characteristics:

**Step 1: Population Inventory**

Identify which Series 9 populations are present in significant numbers using TD-A identification methodology. Not all states have all populations. Texas has substantial border and farmworker populations; Maine does not. Montana has substantial frontier population; Ohio does not.

**Step 2: Screen Each Present Population**

Apply decision tree screening questions to each identified population. Document which questions each population triggers.

**Step 3: Identify Required Accommodations**

Match triggered screening questions to accommodation types. Populations triggering multiple questions require multiple accommodations.

**Step 4: Assess State Capacity**

Evaluate state infrastructure for providing required accommodations. Does state have:
- Tribal liaison capacity for sovereignty-respecting consultation?
- Interstate data sharing agreements for portability?
- Alternative delivery models for frontier populations?
- VA coordination mechanisms for veteran integration?
- Medicaid pre-release enrollment for justice-involved transition?

**Step 5: Prioritize Accommodations**

Given resource constraints, not all accommodations can be implemented simultaneously. Prioritize based on:
- Population size
- Severity of need
- Feasibility of implementation
- State capacity
- Political support

**Step 6: Design Implementation**

Develop specific protocols, agreements, and service modifications to deliver required accommodations. Ensure accommodation design integrates with rather than fragments overall RHTP implementation.

### CMS Flexibility Provisions

RHTP operates within federal parameters that constrain state flexibility. CMS has provided explicit flexibility in some areas relevant to accommodation:

**State Plan Amendment Process:** States may submit SPAs requesting accommodation-related modifications to standard Medicaid requirements. CMS has approved SPAs for:
- Tribal consultation protocols
- Mobile health reimbursement
- Community health worker billing
- Telehealth expansions
- Pre-release Medicaid enrollment

**1115 Waiver Authority:** Demonstration waivers enable broader flexibility for innovative accommodations. States have obtained waivers for:
- Justice-involved transition programs
- SUD treatment expansions
- SDOH integration pilots
- Alternative delivery models

**RHTP-Specific Flexibilities:** CMS guidance for RHTP implementation acknowledges population-specific accommodation needs. States should reference this guidance when designing accommodations.

**Limits on Flexibility:** Federal law constrains some accommodations:
- Documentation requirements for federal program eligibility cannot be waived by states
- Veterans cannot be required to use RHTP instead of VA services
- Tribal sovereignty cannot be overridden by state program requirements
- Certain populations (undocumented adults) remain ineligible for federal Medicaid regardless of state preferences

### Accountability for Population-Specific Outcomes

Accommodation without accountability produces special programs without evidence of effectiveness. States implementing accommodations should establish:

**Baseline Assessment:** Document population health status, access measures, and utilization before accommodation implementation. Without baseline, improvement cannot be measured.

**Population-Specific Metrics:** Define outcomes relevant to specific populations:
- Tribal: IHS-RHTP coordination effectiveness, tribal health system strengthening, culturally appropriate service access
- Frontier: Access within geographic constraints, emergency response times, telehealth utilization
- Farmworkers: Continuity across migrations, chronic disease management, occupational health
- Veterans: VA-community care coordination, mental health access, suicide prevention
- Justice-involved: Enrollment completion, continuity through transition, recidivism related to health

**Reporting Requirements:** Require regular reporting on accommodation implementation and outcomes. Include population-specific data in RHTP performance monitoring.

**Adjustment Mechanisms:** Enable modification of accommodations based on outcome evidence. Accommodations that fail to improve population outcomes should be redesigned or discontinued.

### Avoiding Common Implementation Failures

**Fragmentation:** Designing accommodations as separate programs rather than modifications to core RHTP creates silos. Accommodate within unified systems rather than creating categorical programs.

**Administrative Burden:** Accommodation requirements that create excessive documentation burden for providers or beneficiaries will not be implemented effectively. Design accommodations that simplify rather than complicate access.

**Unfunded Requirements:** Mandating accommodations without funding produces paper compliance. Budget accommodation costs explicitly.

**Pilot Paralysis:** Treating every accommodation as a demonstration project delays implementation indefinitely. Some accommodations have sufficient evidence base for immediate implementation.

**Categorical Thinking:** Designing accommodations for single populations ignores intersectionality. An elderly tribal veteran with SMI requires accommodation addressing all relevant characteristics, not separate categorical programs for each.
