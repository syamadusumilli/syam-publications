# RHTP 7.TD.B
# Provider Reimbursement Comparison Matrix
## Payment Environments Create Transformation Capacity

*Series 7: Healthcare Providers*
*Technical Document B*
*Rural Health Transformation Project*

## Purpose and Analytical Value

This technical document compiles **payment methodologies and rates affecting rural healthcare providers** across payer types and provider categories. The matrix serves Series 7 articles by revealing how reimbursement environments shape provider financial capacity and, consequently, transformation potential.

**Key insight:** Payment policy creates different transformation environments across states and provider types. Providers operating under identical RHTP transformation expectations face radically different financial realities depending on their payer mix, state Medicaid policies, and provider designation. **A CAH in Montana receiving cost-based Medicaid reimbursement operates in a fundamentally different environment than a CAH in Texas receiving Medicaid rates that cover 60% of costs.**

This document enables analysis of why similarly structured providers in similar communities achieve different outcomes. The answer often lies in payment policy variation invisible to observers focused on program design.

## Section 1: Medicare Rates by Provider Type

### Hospital Providers

| Provider Type | Payment Basis | CY 2026 Rate Summary | Rural Adjustments | Key Limitations |
|---------------|---------------|----------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Critical Access Hospital** | Cost-based | 101% of allowable costs | None beyond cost-based structure | 2% sequestration reduces effective rate to ~99%; not all costs allowable; coinsurance based on charges creates patient burden |
| **Rural Emergency Hospital** | OPPS + facility fee | 105% of OPPS rate + $293,107/month facility payment (CY 2026 est.) | 5% service premium; fixed monthly facility payment | No inpatient services; must maintain 24/7 ED; limited to 42 facilities nationally as of October 2025 |
| **Sole Community Hospital** | IPPS with floor | Hospital-specific rate floor based on 1982, 1987, 1996, or 2006 base year | Rate cannot fall below historical base | Must be sole hospital in area; 100+ bed limitation for some benefits |
| **Medicare Dependent Hospital** | IPPS with adjustment | 75% of difference between IPPS and hospital-specific rate | Available only to hospitals with 60%+ Medicare payer mix | Limited to rural hospitals under 100 beds; phases out periodically |
| **PPS Hospital (Rural)** | DRG-based | Wage index and rural add-on adjustments | Low-volume adjustment; rural floor; geographic reclassification options | Volume thresholds can disqualify small hospitals from add-ons |

### Primary Care and Clinic Providers

| Provider Type | Payment Basis | CY 2026 Rate Summary | Key Features | Limitations |
|---------------|---------------|----------------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Rural Health Clinic** | All-inclusive rate (AIR) | **$165 per visit** payment limit for independent and large hospital PBRHCs | Cost-based with statutory cap; grandfathered PBRHCs may exceed cap | Cap limits reimbursement for clinics with costs above $165; telehealth flexibilities expire January 31, 2026 without legislation |
| **FQHC** | Prospective payment | **$207.72 base rate** (CY 2026); +34.16% for new patients/AWV/IPPE | Geographic adjustment factor applies; separate care management billing at PFS rates | Per-encounter payment regardless of visit complexity |
| **Provider-Based RHC (Grandfathered)** | Cost-based | Greater of: CY 2025 rate + 2.7% MEI OR $165 national limit | Applies to PBRHCs in hospitals under 50 beds enrolled before December 31, 2020 | Must maintain qualifying status; associated hospital bed count determines eligibility |

### Emergency Medical Services

| Service Level | Payment Basis | CY 2026 Rate Summary | Rural Adjustments | Notes |
|---------------|---------------|----------------------|-------------------|-------|
| **BLS Ground (A0428)** | Fee schedule | ~$290 base (varies by locality) | +3% rural; +22.6% super-rural bonus | Locality GPCI adjustments apply |
| **ALS Level 1 (A0426)** | Fee schedule | ~$435 base (varies by locality) | +3% rural; +22.6% super-rural bonus | Higher RVU than BLS |
| **ALS Level 2 (A0433)** | Fee schedule | ~$630 base (varies by locality) | +3% rural; +22.6% super-rural bonus | Highest ground ambulance RVU |
| **Ground Mileage (Rural)** | Per mile | ~$8.50 per mile (miles 1-17); ~$5.50 per mile (miles 18+) | 1.5x urban mileage rate for rural | Loaded miles only; no payment for response |
| **Rural Add-Ons** | Temporary | +2% urban; +3% rural | Extended through January 30, 2026 | Expire January 31, 2026 without legislation |

**Critical EMS payment gap:** Medicare pays only for "loaded miles" (patient on board). No payment for response to scene or return after transport. Rural EMS with long response distances loses money on every Medicare transport regardless of payment rates.

### Long-Term Care

| Service Type | Payment Basis | CY 2026 Rate Summary | Notes |
|--------------|---------------|----------------------|-------|
| **SNF (PPS)** | Per diem case-mix | National average ~$600/day; varies by case-mix group | Rural adjustment factor applies |
| **CAH Swing Bed** | Cost-based | 101% of allowable costs | OIG recommends alignment with SNF PPS (~$350/day); CMS has not concurred |
| **Home Health** | LUPA/30-day periods | ~$2,000 per 30-day period (average) | Geographic and case-mix adjustments |

### Behavioral Health

| Service Type | Payment Basis | CY 2026 Rate Summary | Notes |
|--------------|---------------|----------------------|-------|
| **IPF (Inpatient Psychiatric)** | Per diem PPS | ~$880 base rate; 2.5% update for CY 2026 | Teaching and rural adjustment factors increasing in FY 2026 |
| **FQHC/RHC Mental Health** | Same as medical visit | $207.72 FQHC / $165 RHC | Audio-only permanently allowed; in-person requirement delayed to January 31, 2026 |
| **CMHC** | Partial hospitalization | OPPS rates for PHP services | Often below actual costs |
| **IOP (RHC/FQHC)** | Per-day rate | 3 services: $319.38; 4+ services: $418.45 | New benefit effective 2024 |

## Section 2: Medicaid Payment Variation

Medicaid reimbursement varies dramatically across states, creating **fundamentally different operating environments** for providers serving identical patient populations. The following analysis presents state-level variation for key provider types.

### State Medicaid-to-Medicare Fee Index

The **Medicaid-to-Medicare Fee Index** measures state Medicaid physician fees as a percentage of Medicare rates. Rural providers serving high-Medicaid populations in low-fee states face structural deficits no transformation strategy can overcome.

| State Category | Medicaid-to-Medicare Ratio | Example States | Transformation Implication |
|----------------|---------------------------|----------------|---------------------------|
| **High (>90%)** | 90-120% of Medicare | Alaska, Montana, North Dakota, Wyoming | Medicaid revenue approaches adequacy; transformation investment possible |
| **Moderate (70-90%)** | 70-89% of Medicare | Colorado, Minnesota, Washington, Oregon | Medicaid losses manageable with Medicare cross-subsidy |
| **Low (50-70%)** | 50-69% of Medicare | Texas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana | Significant Medicaid losses; transformation capacity constrained |
| **Very Low (<50%)** | Below 50% of Medicare | Some service categories in multiple states | Medicaid services generate substantial losses; providers avoid Medicaid patients |

**Data limitation:** KFF Medicaid-to-Medicare Fee Index captures physician services only. Hospital and facility payment variation is more complex and less consistently reported.

### State Medicaid Hospital Payment Approaches

| Approach | States Using | Mechanism | Impact on Rural Hospitals |
|----------|-------------|-----------|---------------------------|
| **Cost-based reimbursement for CAHs** | ~15 states | Medicaid pays cost-based (like Medicare) for CAHs | Protects CAHs from Medicaid losses |
| **DRG-based with rural add-on** | ~20 states | Prospective payment with rural adjustment | Adjustment rarely covers rural cost premium |
| **Fee schedule** | ~10 states | Fixed rates regardless of provider type | Often significantly below cost |
| **Managed care rates** | Varies | MCO negotiates with providers | Rates often at or below FFS; supplemental payments may apply |

### State-Directed Payments in Managed Care

**37 of 41 MCO states** reported state-directed payments (SDPs) for hospital services as of July 2024. SDPs supplement base MCO payments to approach Medicare or commercial rates.

| SDP Structure | States | Mechanism | Rural Impact |
|---------------|--------|-----------|--------------|
| **Average Commercial Rate (ACR)** | Emerging (5+ states pursuing) | Supplemental payment to reach commercial rate average | Significant increase where implemented; requires state match |
| **Medicare Parity** | ~20 states | Supplemental payment to reach Medicare FFS equivalent | Helps but does not cover full costs for many rural providers |
| **DSH-style distribution** | ~15 states | Directed payments based on uncompensated care burden | Benefits high-uncompensated-care providers |

### RHC and FQHC Medicaid Payment

Federal law requires states to pay FQHCs and RHCs using a **Prospective Payment System (PPS)** methodology at rates no lower than their facility-specific historical costs, updated annually.

| State Approach | Description | Example States |
|----------------|-------------|----------------|
| **PPS with APM option** | Standard PPS with alternative payment methodology available | North Carolina (implemented 2024), California |
| **PPS cost-settled** | Interim payments with cost report settlement | Missouri, many others |
| **Managed care wrap** | MCO pays negotiated rate; state pays difference to PPS | Most MCO states |

**Key limitation:** FQHC/RHC PPS rates are facility-specific based on historical costs. New clinics or expanding clinics may face rates below current costs until cost reports establish new baselines.

## Section 3: Commercial Payer Benchmarks

Commercial insurance payment rates establish the **ceiling** against which Medicare and Medicaid rates compare. Rural providers typically lack negotiating leverage to achieve urban commercial rates.

### Commercial-to-Medicare Ratios by Service Type

| Service Category | National Average Commercial Rate (% of Medicare) | Rural Rate (% of Medicare) | Gap |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-----|
| **Inpatient Hospital** | 224% | 150-180% | Rural hospitals receive 25-35% less than urban |
| **Outpatient Hospital** | 254% | 160-200% | Similar urban-rural gap |
| **Professional Services** | 129% | 110-125% | Smaller but still significant gap |

**Source:** Milliman Commercial Reimbursement Benchmarking 2025

### Rural Commercial Payment Challenges

**Negotiating leverage:** Rural providers often have limited commercial volume and face dominant regional insurers. Single-hospital markets should theoretically have leverage, but commercial payers can direct patients to urban facilities for elective care.

**Network adequacy:** State network adequacy requirements may require plans to include rural providers, but adequacy standards rarely specify reimbursement floors.

**Self-funded employers:** ERISA-exempt employer plans negotiate directly with providers and may pay below commercial benchmarks.

## Section 4: Payment-Transformation Relationship Analysis

### The Revenue Adequacy Threshold

Transformation capacity requires **revenue adequacy**: sufficient reimbursement to cover operating costs plus margin for investment. Providers below the adequacy threshold consume all resources on survival; none remain for transformation.

| Payer Mix Scenario | Typical Margin | Transformation Capacity | Notes |
|--------------------|----------------|------------------------|-------|
| **High Medicare (>60%)** | 0-3% for CAHs; negative for PPS | Low to moderate | Cost-based CAH protection helps; volume decline still threatens |
| **High Medicaid (>40%)** | Negative 2-8% | Very low | Medicaid losses overwhelm; state payment policy determines viability |
| **Balanced Mix** | 1-4% | Moderate | Cross-subsidy potential; commercial volume critical |
| **High Commercial (>30%)** | 3-8% | Moderate to high | Only achievable in markets with commercial employment base |
| **High Uninsured (>15%)** | Negative 5-15% | None | Bad debt/charity care overwhelms any positive margins |

### State Payment Environment and Provider Outcomes

**States where rural providers report positive operating margins** tend to share characteristics:

1. **Medicaid expansion** reducing uninsured population
2. **Cost-based Medicaid payment** for CAHs or RHCs
3. **Robust supplemental payment programs** addressing Medicaid-Medicare gaps
4. **State appropriations** for rural health infrastructure
5. **Commercial rate leverage** from network adequacy requirements

**States where rural providers struggle** despite RHTP investment:

1. **Non-expansion states** with high uninsured rates
2. **Low Medicaid payment rates** creating structural deficits
3. **Limited supplemental payment programs**
4. **High Medicare Advantage penetration** with rates below traditional Medicare
5. **Declining commercial population** as young workers leave rural areas

### Medicare Advantage Impact on Rural Providers

**Medicare Advantage penetration** creates additional payment variation. MA plans negotiate rates that often fall **10-15% below traditional Medicare FFS** for rural providers.

| MA Penetration Level | Traditional Medicare Share | Impact on CAHs |
|----------------------|---------------------------|----------------|
| **Low (<20%)** | 80%+ | Cost-based protection largely intact |
| **Moderate (20-40%)** | 60-80% | Mixed; growing MA share erodes cost-based benefit |
| **High (>40%)** | <60% | Significant revenue loss; CAH advantage diminished |

**Critical point:** CAH cost-based reimbursement applies only to traditional Medicare. As MA enrollment grows (now exceeding 50% of Medicare beneficiaries nationally), the CAH payment protection weakens proportionally.

## Section 5: Provider-Specific Payment Implications

### Critical Access Hospitals

**Optimal payment environment:**
- Traditional Medicare dominant (>70% of Medicare patients)
- State Medicaid cost-based reimbursement
- Commercial rates at or above Medicare
- Low uninsured population

**Challenging payment environment:**
- High MA penetration eroding cost-based protection
- State Medicaid paying 60-70% of costs
- Limited commercial volume
- High uninsured/self-pay population

### Rural Health Clinics

**Optimal payment environment:**
- Costs below $165 AIR cap (or grandfathered PBRHC status)
- State Medicaid PPS above costs
- Commercial contracts at Medicare parity or above

**Challenging payment environment:**
- Costs significantly above AIR cap
- State Medicaid PPS below actual costs
- Heavy Medicaid caseload with wrap payment delays

### FQHCs

**Optimal payment environment:**
- Established PPS rate reflecting actual costs
- State Medicaid wrap payments timely
- 330 grant funding supplementing patient revenue
- Diverse payer mix reducing single-payer dependence

**Challenging payment environment:**
- New or expanding clinic with below-cost PPS rate
- State managed care with poor FQHC rate negotiation
- Heavy uninsured population despite sliding fee scale
- 330 grant insufficient to cover uncompensated care

### Emergency Medical Services

**Payment environment is uniformly challenging:**
- Medicare pays only loaded miles
- Medicaid rates often 50-70% of Medicare
- Commercial rates inconsistent
- High uninsured transport volume

**No sustainable EMS payment model exists** in most rural areas without subsidy. Payment reform cannot solve fundamental gap between fee-schedule reimbursement and cost of maintaining 24/7 response capacity in low-volume areas.

## Section 6: Payment Policy Implications for RHTP

### What RHTP Cannot Change

RHTP funding does not alter underlying payment policy. Transformation investments occur **on top of** existing payment environments. States and providers face identical Medicare fee schedules and state-determined Medicaid rates whether or not RHTP exists.

**Implication:** RHTP transformation strategies must account for payment environment variation. A transformation approach viable in Montana (cost-based Medicaid, high traditional Medicare) may be impossible in Texas (low Medicaid rates, non-expansion, high MA penetration).

### What RHTP Could Influence

RHTP investments could address payment environment challenges by:

1. **Supporting cost-based Medicaid payment advocacy** at state level
2. **Funding EMS subsidy models** that acknowledge payment gap
3. **Enabling value-based payment pilots** with shared savings potential
4. **Building network arrangements** that improve commercial negotiating leverage
5. **Supporting managed care contract negotiation** for rural provider coalitions

### Payment Reform Priorities by Provider Type

| Provider Type | Highest-Impact Payment Reform | Political Feasibility | RHTP Role |
|---------------|------------------------------|----------------------|-----------|
| **CAH** | MA payment parity with traditional Medicare | Low (requires legislation) | Advocacy support |
| **REH** | Facility payment adjustment for inflation | Moderate | Demonstration data |
| **RHC** | AIR cap elimination or significant increase | Moderate | Cost documentation |
| **FQHC** | Complexity adjustment in PPS | Moderate | Quality/outcome data |
| **EMS** | Response/standby payment model | Low in current environment | Pilot funding |
| **Rural Hospital** | DSH/uncompensated care methodology reform | Low to moderate | State supplemental payment advocacy |
