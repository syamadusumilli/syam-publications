## The Last Generalists and the Accountability Gap

**Series 7: Healthcare Providers**

In Garrison, Nebraska, population 1,200, Dr. James Kowalski has practiced alone for 38 years. He knows three generations of families. He makes house calls when needed. He opens the clinic on Sunday mornings for farmers who cannot leave their operations during the week. **He is irreplaceable, and he knows it.**

Kowalski turns 68 this year. His knees hurt. His enthusiasm for 3 a.m. emergency calls has diminished. He has recruited continuously since 2015, offering generous terms, nominal practice sale prices, and promises of community support. No physician has been willing to relocate permanently.

When Kowalski retires, Garrison will have no doctor. The nearest alternative is 45 miles away in a town whose own practice is also nearing retirement. The health system in that town has declined to extend services to Garrison because patient volumes cannot support employed physician compensation after overhead costs.

This example illustrates what independent rural physician practice has become: **indispensable, unsustainable, and approaching extinction**. The 43% decline in independent rural physicians between 2019 and 2024 represents not merely career transitions but the dismantling of a care delivery model that sustained rural communities for generations.

This article examines the tension between provider interest and patient need that defines independent practice in rural settings. Independent physicians make treatment decisions without organizational oversight. They set their own hours, determine their own referral patterns, and control ancillary services that affect practice revenue. This autonomy enables deep patient relationships and clinical flexibility. It also creates an accountability gap where **no external mechanism ensures that provider decisions align with patient welfare**.

RHTP largely bypasses independent physicians. Funding flows to hospitals, health centers, networks, and systems. Independent practices lack the organizational infrastructure to receive grants, implement programs, or participate in transformation initiatives. Yet independent physicians still provide substantial rural primary care. Understanding their experience, constraints, and incentive environment matters for assessing whether rural healthcare transformation can succeed.

**Information Limits**

Independent physician practices do not submit standardized financial reports comparable to hospital cost reports or FQHC Uniform Data System submissions. Practice finances remain largely private. This analysis relies on aggregate survey data, employment trend research, and qualitative evidence about practice conditions. Individual practice data presented in this article represents estimates based on available research rather than verified financial statements.

## The Independent Practice Landscape

### The Collapse in Progress

The Physicians Advocacy Institute and Avalere documented a transformation in rural physician practice between January 2019 and January 2024:

| Metric | 2019 | 2024 | Change |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| Total rural physicians | 52,600 | 50,100 | -5% |
| Independent rural physicians | 21,956 | 12,467 | -43% |
| Independent rural practices | 17,400 | 10,100 | -42% |
| Hospital/health system employed | 48% | 58% | +10 pts |
| Corporate entity employed | 11% | 18% | +7 pts |

**Nearly 9,500 rural physicians left independent practice in five years.** Some retired. Some accepted employment with hospitals or health systems. Some joined corporate entities including private equity-backed groups, staffing companies, and insurers. The net result: 76% of rural physicians are now employed by hospitals, health systems, or corporate entities. Only 24% remain independent.

The geographic distribution of losses concentrated in the Midwest and Northeast. Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Ohio, South Carolina, and South Dakota each lost more than 50% of independent physicians. These states share characteristics: aging physician populations, competitive employment markets, and limited rural practice support infrastructure.

### Who Remains Independent

Independent rural physicians in 2026 fall into recognizable categories:

**The veteran practitioners.** Physicians over 60 who established practices decades ago, built patient relationships, and lack interest in employment arrangements that would disrupt continuity. They practice independently because they always have. Many face succession crises identical to Kowalski's.

**The mission-driven newcomers.** Younger physicians who explicitly chose independent rural practice despite employment alternatives. They value autonomy, community connection, and practice control enough to accept financial and lifestyle sacrifices. This group is small and self-selecting.

**The Rural Health Clinic operators.** Physicians who converted practices to RHC status for enhanced Medicare reimbursement. Independence here means ownership of a certified facility rather than employment, though 66% of RHCs are now provider-based (hospital-owned) rather than independent.

**The procedural specialists.** Surgeons, obstetricians, and other procedure-focused physicians who maintain independent practices because their revenue potential exceeds employed compensation. This category is shrinking as hospital employment packages have become more competitive.

### Why Independence Disappeared

The forces driving employment consolidation are well-documented but bear repeating:

**Medicare physician payment has declined 29% in inflation-adjusted terms since 2001.** The Medicare Physician Fee Schedule provides no automatic inflation update. Each year, nominal payments remain flat while practice costs increase. Independent practices absorb these losses without the cross-subsidization mechanisms available to larger organizations.

**Administrative burden consumes two hours for every hour of patient care.** Prior authorization requirements, quality reporting demands, documentation standards, and payer negotiations consume physician time. Employed physicians have organizational infrastructure absorbing these burdens. Independent physicians handle administration themselves or hire staff they cannot afford.

**Electronic health record mandates required capital investment independent practices could not readily access.** EHR implementation costs ranged from $30,000 to over $100,000 for small practices. Ongoing maintenance, updates, and interoperability requirements add continuing expense. The investment improved documentation but not clinical care, generating costs without proportionate revenue.

**Malpractice insurance costs create annual fixed expenses** that must be covered regardless of patient volume. Rural practices with lower revenue bases face the same premiums as urban practices with higher volumes. The arithmetic becomes unsustainable in low-population markets.

**Recruitment competition favors employment.** Health systems offer signing bonuses, loan repayment, guaranteed salaries, and quality-of-life benefits independent practices cannot match. Medical graduates carry average debt exceeding $200,000. Employment security appeals more than practice ownership risk.

## The Provider Interest Versus Patient Need Tension

### Framing the Tension

**The Provider Autonomy View:** Independent physicians provide care unconstrained by corporate protocols, production quotas, or organizational politics. They can spend time with complex patients without productivity pressure. They can adjust treatment approaches based on individual knowledge rather than standardized guidelines. They maintain relationships that enable trust and disclosure. Patient need is best served by autonomous practitioners who answer to patients, not institutions.

**The Accountability Concern:** Independent physicians operate without external oversight. No quality committee reviews their decisions. No peer review examines their outcomes. No organizational standard constrains their referral patterns or ancillary service utilization. Fee-for-service payment rewards volume regardless of value. **Patients cannot evaluate whether their physician's recommendations serve patient need or provider interest.** The same autonomy that enables excellent care also permits self-interested practice.

**The Evidence Question:** Do independent physicians provide better or worse care than employed counterparts? Does employment produce higher quality through accountability, or does it produce protocol-driven medicine that ignores individual variation? What evidence distinguishes provider interest from patient need in specific clinical decisions?

### The Fee-for-Service Incentive Problem

Independent rural physicians operating under fee-for-service payment face incentive structures that can diverge from patient welfare:

**Volume rewards regardless of outcome.** More visits generate more revenue. The physician who schedules four follow-up appointments generates more income than the physician who resolves the problem in one visit. Payment does not distinguish between necessary and unnecessary care.

**Ancillary services generate profit margins.** Physicians who own laboratory equipment, imaging capacity, or other diagnostic services profit from ordering those services. The rural exception to Stark self-referral restrictions permits rural providers to refer patients to services they own. Studies consistently find physicians order more ancillary services when they own the equipment performing those services.

**Referral decisions affect practice revenue.** The independent physician who refers a patient to a specialist loses that revenue. The physician who manages the condition within the practice retains it. Some conditions require referral regardless. Others fall in gray zones where reasonable practitioners might differ. The financial incentive favors managing conditions in-house even when referral might be clinically superior.

**None of this implies rural physicians routinely prioritize self-interest.** Most physicians entered medicine to help patients. Professional ethics constrain self-interested behavior. Personal relationships with patients create accountability that institutional employment does not replicate. **But the incentive structure creates tension between provider interest and patient need that individual ethics must overcome.**

### The Quality Oversight Gap

Employed physicians face multiple accountability mechanisms:

**Credentialing and privileging** require demonstrating competence before permission to practice.

**Peer review** examines adverse outcomes, patient complaints, and practice patterns.

**Quality committees** establish standards and monitor compliance.

**Performance metrics** link compensation to quality indicators.

**Medical director oversight** provides ongoing supervision.

Independent rural physicians face none of these mechanisms. They self-credential. They review their own outcomes. They set their own standards. They answer to no medical director. **The only accountability is patient satisfaction, malpractice exposure, and licensing board complaints.**

This gap matters more as physicians age. Cognitive decline, outdated knowledge, and physical limitations can impair practice without self-recognition. Employed physicians can be gradually transitioned to reduced responsibilities or different roles. Independent physicians practice until they choose to stop, retire abruptly when health fails, or die while still seeing patients.

### Decision Scenario: The Referral Decision

*Dr. Sarah Chen operates an independent family practice in Moberly, Missouri, population 13,000. She has practiced there for 22 years after completing residency.*

Chen's practice includes in-office X-ray capability and basic laboratory services. These ancillary revenues contribute approximately $80,000 annually to practice income, representing the difference between moderate compensation and financial distress.

Mrs. Patricia Hawkins, 67, presents with persistent knee pain. Physical examination suggests degenerative arthritis. Chen could order in-house X-rays to confirm, generating practice revenue of approximately $150. She could also refer directly to the orthopedic surgeon 25 miles away, whose office has superior imaging and would perform its own workup.

**The clinical question has no definitive answer.** In-house imaging provides faster results, maintains care continuity, and enables Chen to manage the condition if severity is mild. Referral provides specialist evaluation, better imaging, and access to surgical options if needed. Reasonable physicians could choose either path.

The financial incentive clearly favors in-house imaging. Chen's revenue increases with the former choice, decreases with the latter. Her decision-making process is opaque. Mrs. Hawkins cannot evaluate whether the X-ray serves her interest or Chen's practice economics.

**Chen orders the in-house X-ray.** It shows moderate arthritis consistent with age. She prescribes anti-inflammatory medication and recommends weight loss. Three months later, Mrs. Hawkins returns with worsening symptoms. Chen refers to orthopedics. The specialist orders MRI revealing cartilage damage that was not visible on X-ray. Surgery is recommended.

Did the initial X-ray delay appropriate diagnosis? Would earlier referral have changed the outcome? **The answers are unknowable.** What is clear: the financial incentive did not align with the decision that would have identified the actual problem fastest.

This scenario does not allege misconduct. Chen may have genuinely believed in-house imaging served Mrs. Hawkins best. The point is that the incentive structure creates situations where provider interest and patient need point different directions, and no accountability mechanism ensures alignment.

## Provider Experience Analysis

### Practice Characteristics

The following table presents estimated characteristics of independent rural physician practices across different contexts:

| Practice | State | Type | Physician Count | Estimated Revenue | Ownership Structure | Payer Mix (Medicare/Medicaid/Commercial) | RHTP Connection | Transformation Capacity |
|----------|-------|------|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| Garrison Family Practice | NE | Solo | 1 | $450K | Physician-owned | 65/15/20 | None | None; succession crisis |
| Moberly Family Medicine | MO | Solo | 1 | $620K | Physician-owned | 58/22/20 | None | Limited; ancillary dependent |
| Prairie Health Associates | IA | Small group | 4 | $2.4M | Physician partnership | 52/18/30 | ACO exploration | Moderate through scale |
| Mountain View Medical | MT | Solo (RHC) | 1 | $380K | Physician-owned RHC | 62/18/20 | RHTP subrecipient through state | Limited; retirement pending |
| Delta Family Physicians | MS | Small group | 3 | $1.8M | Physician partnership | 68/24/8 | None | Very limited; Medicaid underpayment |
| Central Kansas Primary Care | KS | Solo (RHC) | 2 | $890K | Physician-owned RHC | 64/16/20 | Flex Program TA | Moderate |
| High Plains Family Practice | TX | Solo | 1 | $510K | Physician-owned | 70/10/20 | None | None; financial distress |
| Upstate Rural Medicine | NY | Small group | 3 | $2.1M | Physician partnership | 48/28/24 | FQHC collaboration discussion | Potential through conversion |

**Analysis Dimensions:**

**Financial capacity** among independent practices ranges from subsistence to moderate sustainability. Solo practices without RHC certification face the most challenging economics: Medicare fee schedule rates that have declined in real terms, administrative burdens without staff support, and fixed costs spread over limited patient volumes. **Practices with estimated revenues under $500,000 typically provide physician compensation below employed physician market rates.**

**Operational capacity** is minimal by definition. Independent practices lack dedicated administrators, quality staff, compliance officers, or transformation coordinators. The physician handles clinical care, business management, regulatory compliance, and strategic planning simultaneously. Bandwidth for transformation initiatives approaches zero.

**RHTP participation** is largely absent. RHTP funding flows through state agencies to designated recipients including hospitals, health centers, and regional organizations. Independent physicians rarely appear as direct recipients. Some connect indirectly through RHC certification (accessing HRSA programs), ACO participation (receiving shared savings), or state Flex Program technical assistance. Most have no RHTP connection whatsoever.

**Transformation capacity** correlates with scale and certification. Small group practices with four or more physicians can share administrative functions and investment costs. RHC-certified practices access enhanced Medicare payment and become visible to state rural health programs. Solo practices without certification have transformation capacity approaching zero regardless of leadership commitment.

### The Employment Alternative

For struggling independent physicians, employment represents escape rather than defeat:

**Guaranteed income** replaces revenue volatility. Employed physicians receive salaries regardless of patient volume, payer mix shifts, or practice expense fluctuations.

**Administrative support** absorbs burdens that consumed independent practice time. Billing, compliance, prior authorization, and quality reporting become organizational functions rather than physician responsibilities.

**Call coverage** through group arrangements reduces night and weekend burdens that make independent rural practice physically unsustainable.

**Benefits packages** including health insurance, retirement plans, and malpractice coverage provide security independent practice could not.

**The tradeoff:** employed physicians lose autonomy, practice control, and direct patient relationships. They accept productivity requirements, organizational protocols, and institutional politics. For many, this tradeoff is acceptable. For others, it represents abandoning what made medicine meaningful.

## The Provider Impossibility View

### The Argument

**A competing perspective argues that independent rural physicians face impossible circumstances** that make transformation expectations unreasonable. These physicians manage patient loads that would require multiple providers in urban settings. They handle administrative burdens without staff support. They provide services at reimbursement rates below cost. They maintain 24/7 availability for communities that depend on them.

**The strongest version of this argument:** Asking overwhelmed solo practitioners to transform care delivery is asking people carrying maximum loads to carry more. Independent rural physicians are not failing to transform. They are succeeding at survival against odds that would destroy most enterprises. The problem is structural: payment policy, regulatory burden, and workforce dynamics have made independent practice unsustainable. Transformation discussions distract from the real issue.

### Assessment

This view **correctly identifies structural barriers that individual excellence cannot overcome**. Payment rates that have declined 29% in real terms over two decades create financial conditions no business model can solve through efficiency or innovation. Administrative requirements designed for large organizations impose disproportionate burdens on small practices. Workforce preferences that favor employment and urban settings leave rural communities without succession options regardless of community need or practice quality.

However, the view **risks excusing provider behaviors that harm patients**. Not all independent rural physicians are overwhelmed heroes doing their best under impossible conditions. Some maintain outdated practices, resist change, and justify self-interested decisions as patient-centered care. The impossibility narrative can shield inadequate care from critique.

**The assessment:** Structural barriers are real and primary. Policy must address payment adequacy, administrative burden, and workforce supply. But structural barriers do not absolve individual providers from professional obligations. Impossible circumstances do not justify substandard care. Both the structural critique and individual accountability matter.

## RHTP and Independent Physicians

### The Policy Gap

RHTP's design assumes organizational recipients with capacity to receive funds, implement programs, and report outcomes. Independent physician practices lack this capacity:

**Grant administration** requires staff time independent practices do not have.

**Match requirements** assume financial resources beyond operating margins.

**Reporting obligations** demand data collection and analysis infrastructure.

**Implementation activities** require bandwidth consumed by patient care.

The result: RHTP flows around independent physicians rather than through them. Hospitals receive funds to hire employed physicians. FQHCs receive funds to expand into areas where independent physicians practiced. Regional networks receive funds to develop services that compete with independent practices. **Independent physicians watch transformation investments bypass their communities or accelerate their replacement.**

### What Transformation Would Require

For independent physicians to participate meaningfully in rural health transformation:

**Network structures** that provide administrative infrastructure without requiring employment or practice sale. IPAs (independent practice associations), clinically integrated networks, and collaborative models could aggregate practices for shared services while preserving independence.

**Payment models** that reward value rather than volume. Per-member-per-month payments for chronic care management, care coordination fees, and quality bonuses could provide revenue stability independent of visit volume.

**Technical assistance** specifically designed for small independent practices. Current Flex Program resources typically target facilities (hospitals, RHCs, FQHCs) rather than physician practices. Expanding TA eligibility and designing practice-appropriate resources could reach independent physicians.

**Succession support** that facilitates practice transitions rather than closures. Community capital for practice purchase, residency program rotations in independent practices, and J-1 visa placements could create succession pathways that preserve independent practice.

**None of these solutions are prominent in state RHTP implementation plans.** The transformation infrastructure being built assumes employed physicians, organizational providers, and networked systems. Independent practice as a delivery model is being written out of rural healthcare's future.

## The Ownership Matters View

### The Argument

**A competing perspective argues that ownership structure shapes behavior** in ways that affect patient care regardless of individual provider ethics. Physician-owned practices face different incentives than hospital-employed physicians or corporate-employed physicians. Nonprofit community ownership produces different priorities than private equity ownership.

**The strongest version:** For-profit corporate ownership maximizes shareholder returns. Nonprofit hospital employment serves institutional sustainability. Independent practice serves physician lifestyle and income. Only genuinely community-controlled models (like FQHC governance) systematically prioritize patient need. Ownership determines incentives that determine behavior. Individual ethics cannot reliably overcome structural incentives.

### Assessment

This view **correctly identifies that ownership creates systematic incentive differences**. Research consistently finds practice pattern variations correlated with ownership: for-profit ownership associates with higher utilization, private equity ownership with cost reduction affecting quality, and physician ownership with self-referral. These patterns represent statistical tendencies, not universal laws.

However, the view **overstates determinism and understates variation**. Physician-owned practices vary enormously in ethics, quality, and patient-centeredness. Some independent rural physicians provide excellent care that employed physicians could not replicate. Others provide mediocre care that organizational employment might improve. **Ownership creates tendencies, not destiny. Management quality and individual ethics matter alongside ownership structure.**

The assessment: Ownership matters but does not determine outcomes. Policy should recognize ownership effects without treating all providers of a type as equivalent.

## When Independent Practices Can Transform

Limited conditions enable independent practice transformation:

**Group scale.** Practices with four or more physicians can share administrative costs, provide call coverage, and invest collectively in transformation infrastructure. Solo practices cannot achieve this scale without merger or network participation.

**RHC certification.** Practices that convert to Rural Health Clinic status access enhanced Medicare payment that improves financial stability. Certification also connects practices to state Flex Programs and HRSA resources.

**Network participation.** Independent practices that join clinically integrated networks, ACOs, or other collaborative structures gain administrative support and transformation resources while preserving clinical autonomy.

**Community investment.** Communities that provide practice support through tax districts, foundation grants, or subsidized facilities improve practice sustainability and enable transformation investment.

**Young physician leadership.** Practices led by physicians under 50 with long practice horizons can justify transformation investments with payback periods exceeding immediate planning cycles.

## When Independent Practices Cannot Transform

Certain conditions preclude transformation regardless of policy intervention:

**Retirement imminent.** Physicians within five years of retirement will not invest in transformation with payback periods exceeding their practice duration. Their rational strategy is maintenance until exit.

**Solo practice without certification.** Solo practices lacking RHC status have no mechanism to access transformation resources, achieve administrative scale, or develop implementation capacity.

**Financial distress.** Practices already struggling to meet payroll cannot invest in transformation regardless of potential returns. Survival consumes all available resources.

**Community population decline.** Practices in communities losing population face shrinking patient bases that make any investment questionable. Transformation assumes a future worth investing in.

**Physician identity investment.** Practitioners who define professional identity through independence will not accept network participation, organizational affiliation, or collaborative structures regardless of benefits. **Independence is not just a business model; it is an identity.**

## Recommendations

### For State RHTP Implementation

**Extend technical assistance to independent practices.** Current TA through Flex Programs targets facilities rather than practices. Expanding eligibility and designing practice-appropriate resources could reach independent physicians who currently lack any transformation support.

**Create practice network facilitation.** State agencies could convene independent practices into voluntary networks that provide shared administrative services, joint purchasing, and transformation coordination while preserving clinical and business autonomy.

**Fund practice transition support.** Rather than watching practices close when physicians retire, states could invest in succession facilitation: recruitment support, community capital for practice purchase, and transition assistance.

### For Federal Policy

**Address fee schedule adequacy.** Independent practice sustainability requires fee schedule updates that at minimum maintain purchasing power over time. The current trajectory guarantees continued independent practice decline.

**Reduce administrative burden.** Prior authorization reform, quality reporting simplification, and documentation requirement reduction would disproportionately benefit small practices lacking administrative staff.

**Create independent practice participation pathways.** RHTP and successor programs could explicitly design participation mechanisms for practices lacking organizational infrastructure: simplified applications, reduced match requirements, and practice-appropriate reporting.

### For Independent Physicians

**Pursue RHC certification where eligible.** The enhanced payment, regulatory protections, and program connections outweigh certification burdens for most eligible practices.

**Explore network participation.** IPAs, clinically integrated networks, and ACO participation can provide transformation resources while preserving meaningful independence. Employment is not the only alternative to isolation.

**Plan succession proactively.** Beginning recruitment and transition planning five or more years before planned retirement improves succession probability and community outcomes.

## Transition to Series 7 Synthesis

Independent physicians represent the most disaggregated provider category examined in this series. Unlike hospitals organized around facilities, health centers governed by community boards, or systems coordinating multiple sites, **independent practices are individuals making individual decisions in individual communities.**

The transformation question for independent physicians is whether this disaggregation can survive. RHTP assumes organizations that can receive funds, implement programs, and coordinate care. The administrative infrastructure of rural health transformation has no obvious place for solo practitioners managing their own practices while providing patient care.

The Series 7 synthesis will examine whether rural providers across categories can actually transform given financial constraints, workforce limitations, and structural barriers. Independent physicians illustrate the limits of transformation expectations imposed on providers whose survival consumes all available capacity. They also illustrate the accountability gap that organizational employment addresses, however imperfectly.

**The question this article raises but cannot answer:** Should policy preserve independent practice as a care delivery model, or should it accelerate transition to employed, organized, networked structures that better fit transformation infrastructure? The answer depends on values as much as evidence. What is lost when the last generalist in Garrison retires, and what is gained when care transitions to systems designed for accountability rather than autonomy?
