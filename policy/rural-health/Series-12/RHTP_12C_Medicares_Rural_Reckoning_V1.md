# Medicare's Rural Reckoning
## Payment Adequacy vs. Fiscal Pressure

Rural hospitals depend on Medicare for survival. Unlike urban facilities with diverse payer mixes, **rural hospitals derive 40% to 60% of revenue from Medicare**, making them acutely vulnerable to payment policy changes. The Medicare program faces long-term fiscal pressure, and the policy responses to that pressure assume a healthcare landscape where patients have alternatives. Rural patients do not.

This article examines how Medicare payment changes threaten rural hospital viability: site-neutral payment expansion cutting outpatient revenue, Medicare Advantage penetration introducing private insurer dynamics into public coverage, the Rural Emergency Hospital designation offering a survival path that few facilities pursue, and cumulative payment updates that erode margins year after year. The core tension is straightforward: **payment cuts that extend Medicare solvency accelerate rural hospital closures**. The program saves money by losing providers its beneficiaries need.

For RHTP transformation, Medicare payment represents both context and constraint. States cannot build sustainable healthcare systems on facilities that Medicare payment policy destabilizes. Understanding what payment changes mean for rural provider viability reveals whether transformation investments can produce lasting improvement or merely delay inevitable contraction.

## The Payment Architecture

Medicare's traditional fee-for-service program pays rural hospitals through several mechanisms, each with distinct rules and vulnerabilities. **Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs)** receive 101% of allowable costs, a protection established explicitly to preserve rural access. The 1,350 CAHs across the country depend on this cost-based reimbursement, though "allowable costs" excludes many actual expenses and the 1% margin barely covers operations.

Rural hospitals not designated as CAHs receive payment through the **Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS)**, which pays fixed rates for services regardless of actual costs. OPPS rates include differential payments for hospital outpatient departments (HOPDs) compared to freestanding physician practices, recognizing that hospitals maintain emergency capacity, treat sicker patients, and bear regulatory requirements that independent practices avoid. The differential has become a target for payment reform.

**Site-neutral payment** eliminates or reduces this differential, paying hospital outpatient departments the same rates as physician offices for comparable services. The CY 2026 OPPS final rule, issued November 2025, expanded site-neutral payment to drug administration services at off-campus hospital outpatient departments. Affected facilities face payment reductions of approximately 60%, from full OPPS rates to 40% of previous payment. CMS estimates **$290 million in Medicare savings in 2026**, growing to **$8 billion over ten years** as policy expands.

Rural Sole Community Hospitals receive exemption from the 2026 drug administration changes. Critical Access Hospitals are not affected because they receive cost-based payment under a different system. But the policy trajectory points toward broader application. The Bipartisan Policy Center estimates comprehensive site-neutral payment could save **$157 billion over ten years**, a fiscal prize that makes expansion likely regardless of rural impact.

The policy rationale reflects efficiency logic: identical services should receive identical payment regardless of delivery setting. This logic assumes patients can choose between settings, that HOPDs and physician offices compete for the same patients, and that closing hospital-based services shifts volume to lower-cost alternatives. None of these assumptions hold in rural communities. When the hospital outpatient department is the only option within 30 miles, eliminating its payment differential does not create efficiency. It eliminates access.

## Medicare Advantage and Rural Markets

Medicare Advantage (MA) plans have grown from niche products to dominant coverage for many rural beneficiaries. **Over 50% of Medicare beneficiaries in many rural counties now enroll in MA plans**, fundamentally changing the rural hospital revenue environment. MA plans negotiate payment rates with providers rather than accepting traditional Medicare's administered prices, introducing private insurer bargaining power into what was previously a public program.

Research published in Health Economics Review in February 2025 documented correlation between **MA penetration and rural hospital financial distress**. MA plans use network leverage to reduce paid inpatient days, apply prior authorization requirements that delay or deny services, and negotiate rates below traditional Medicare levels. Hospitals cannot refuse MA contracts without losing access to the majority of their Medicare population, but accepting contracts means accepting terms that often do not cover costs.

Network adequacy standards nominally protect rural beneficiaries. CMS requires that 90% of MA enrollees can access care within specified time and distance maximums: 60 miles or 75 minutes for rural counties, compared to 10 miles or 15 minutes in urban areas. But adequacy standards measure network presence, not capacity. A rural hospital may be "in network" while operating at reduced capacity or facing imminent closure. The standard ensures nominal access while actual access deteriorates.

The 2026 MA rules introduce modest improvements: behavioral health network requirements and a 10% credit for telehealth providers in access calculations. These changes acknowledge rural challenges without addressing the fundamental tension between MA plan financial incentives and rural hospital sustainability. Plans profit by reducing utilization; rural hospitals require sufficient volume to maintain services. The structural conflict continues.

## The Rural Emergency Hospital Experiment

Congress created the **Rural Emergency Hospital (REH)** designation in 2020, offering a survival path for hospitals that can no longer sustain inpatient services. REHs eliminate inpatient beds, maintaining only emergency and outpatient services. In exchange, they receive enhanced payment: **105% of OPPS rates** plus a monthly facility payment of **$285,625.90 in 2025**. The model acknowledges that some rural communities cannot support full hospitals but still need emergency access.

The conversion pattern reveals the model's limits. As of October 2025, **only 42 facilities have converted to REH status** despite over 1,500 eligible hospitals. Nineteen converted in 2023, eighteen in 2024, and three in 2025. The slow adoption reflects several barriers: communities resist losing inpatient capacity, the 24/7 emergency staffing requirement remains difficult in workforce shortage areas, and the financial model still produces thin margins. One Texas facility converted to REH status and closed nine months later, demonstrating that conversion does not guarantee survival.

The REH designation addresses one dimension of rural hospital distress, financial non-viability of inpatient services, while assuming other dimensions remain stable. But the facilities most likely to convert face the same workforce shortages, the same declining populations, and the same coverage erosion affecting all rural providers. The designation changes what services facilities can offer and what Medicare pays. It does not change the structural forces driving rural health system contraction.

For communities considering REH conversion, the decision involves trading known challenges for uncertain alternatives. The hospital with struggling inpatient services might convert to REH and stabilize, or might find that outpatient-only operations cannot attract physicians, cannot sustain emergency coverage, and cannot survive without inpatient revenue cross-subsidization. The 42 conversions in three years suggest most communities assess this uncertainty unfavorably.

## The CFO's Impossible Calculation

The Chartis Group's February 2025 analysis identified **432 rural hospitals at elevated closure risk**, approximately one-quarter of all rural hospitals. These facilities face the compound effect of payment changes: site-neutral policy reducing outpatient margins, MA penetration reducing traditional Medicare volume and payment, workforce costs rising faster than payment increases, and cumulative payment updates that do not keep pace with inflation.

Consider the calculation facing a rural hospital CFO. Medicare payment updates for 2026 include a 2.6% increase in OPPS rates, but inflation exceeds 3%. The hospital's actual costs increased 5% due to wage pressures from traveling nurse and locum tenens requirements. Site-neutral expansion reduced drug administration revenue by 60% for off-campus services. MA plans, now covering 55% of Medicare beneficiaries in the service area, negotiated rates 8% below traditional Medicare. The 2.6% "increase" produces a net payment decrease relative to costs.

**Sequestration** adds further pressure. The 2% across-the-board Medicare payment reduction, temporarily suspended during the pandemic, resumed in 2022. For facilities already operating on negative margins, 2% reduction on inadequate payment accelerates the timeline to insolvency. The reconciliation law's additional provisions signal further payment reductions as Congress addresses Medicare's long-term fiscal challenges by extracting savings from provider payments.

The CFO runs scenarios: what payment rates, volume levels, and payer mix combinations produce positive operating margins? The answer, increasingly, is none that reflect realistic projections. The hospital survives through cost-cutting that degrades services, through deferrals that accumulate into facility deterioration, through cross-subsidization from profitable service lines that site-neutral payment targets. Each survival strategy exhausts itself eventually.

The question becomes not whether the hospital can achieve financial sustainability but how long it can continue operating while unsustainable. The answer varies by facility, but the trajectory points the same direction. **152 rural hospitals have closed completely since January 2010**, per the NC Rural Health Research Program tracking. Texas leads with 20 complete closures since 2005, with 159 rural hospitals remaining. Among those remaining, 67% operate at negative margins. Thirteen percent face immediate closure risk.

## The Vignette: Friday Morning Revenue Cycle Meeting

Dr. Patricia Okonkwo reviews the week's numbers with the hospital's billing manager, knowing what she will hear before the spreadsheet opens. Their 25-bed Critical Access Hospital in western Oklahoma, the only hospital in a two-county region, survives on Medicare's 101% cost-based payment for inpatient services and a mix of payers for outpatient care.

"Medicare Advantage denied eighteen prior authorizations this month," the billing manager reports. "Fourteen were eventually approved on appeal, averaging 23 days to resolution. Four remained denied. Two patients received care anyway because they needed it. We'll write that off."

Dr. Okonkwo calculates: denied services, appeal staff time, write-offs, delayed payment even when approved. The MA plans covering 52% of their Medicare population cost more to bill than traditional Medicare and pay less. "What about the infusion patients?"

"Site-neutral hit us harder than projected. We're down 58% on drug administration revenue for the off-campus clinic. We can move some services back to the main campus, but then we're competing with ourselves for space."

The infusion clinic was supposed to be the sustainable service line, the revenue that would carry them while everything else contracted. Now it joins the list of services that cost more to provide than Medicare pays.

"Dr. Reyes submitted her retirement notice," Dr. Okonkwo adds. "Effective in six months. Recruitment has been open for two years with no candidates."

The billing manager does not respond. They both know what losing their only hospitalist means. They will become a hospital that cannot admit patients to its own beds, referring everything to facilities an hour away, maintaining inpatient capacity that generates no revenue.

"Have we looked at REH conversion?" the billing manager asks.

Dr. Okonkwo has looked. The monthly facility payment would help, the 105% OPPS rate would help, but eliminating inpatient beds eliminates the reason anyone comes here instead of driving to the city. The emergency department cannot function without backup inpatient capacity for the patients too sick to transfer. The community will not accept a hospital that cannot keep their grandmother overnight after a fall.

"We looked," she says. "Keep running the scenarios. There has to be a path."

There might not be. But they will keep looking because 40,000 people within an hour's drive have nowhere else to go.

## RHTP Transformation Implications

RHTP transformation strategies assume functioning healthcare facilities. States plan workforce development for facilities that may not exist when workforce pipeline programs produce graduates. They plan care coordination across systems where coordination partners may close. They plan telehealth expansion from facilities that may lack the financial stability to invest in technology. **Medicare payment policy determines whether the facilities transformation depends on survive long enough for transformation to matter.**

The program's emphasis on sustainability confronts payment reality. Sustainability planning asks: how will these initiatives continue after grant funding ends? The honest answer depends on Medicare payment trajectory. If site-neutral expansion accelerates, if MA payment continues below cost, if cumulative updates continue below inflation, then sustainability becomes impossible regardless of how efficiently states operate. No operational efficiency overcomes revenue that does not cover costs.

States planning RHTP implementation should model transformation strategies under various payment scenarios. The optimistic scenario assumes current payment structures continue with modest updates. The realistic scenario assumes site-neutral expansion, continued MA penetration, and payment updates below cost inflation. The pessimistic scenario assumes comprehensive site-neutral payment and accelerated MA movement toward narrow networks. Transformation strategies viable only under optimistic assumptions may not justify investment.

The alternative view holds that hospitals complaining about inadequate payment have always complained, that predictions of mass closure have not materialized at predicted scale, and that rural facilities will adapt as they always have. This view contains partial truth: rural hospitals demonstrate remarkable resilience, finding survival strategies that analysts did not anticipate. But adaptation has limits, and those limits are approaching. The facilities that adapted successfully over the past decade are not the same facilities facing today's payment environment. Many have already closed. Others have been acquired by systems that extract value before abandoning them. The survivors face accumulated deferred maintenance, workforce departures, and payment policies designed without them in mind.

## Conclusion

Medicare payment policy embodies a tension that cannot be resolved through better policy design: the program must contain costs, and cost containment requires payment reduction, and payment reduction closes rural facilities that serve populations with no alternatives. Site-neutral payment makes sense in markets with competition. Medicare Advantage makes sense when beneficiaries have provider choice. Neither assumption describes rural America.

RHTP transformation cannot offset Medicare payment changes at scale. The program's $50 billion over ten years does not approach the $8 billion site-neutral savings, the $157 billion comprehensive site-neutral potential, or the cumulative impact of MA penetration on rural hospital revenue. Transformation can help individual facilities improve operations, but it cannot overcome a payment environment that produces operating losses regardless of operational efficiency.

Article 12D examines how workforce challenges compound payment pressures. The providers who might sustain rural facilities are leaving faster than pipeline programs can replace them. Payment inadequacy drives workforce exodus as facilities cannot compete for scarce providers. The policy earthquake is not one shock but many, and they reinforce each other.
