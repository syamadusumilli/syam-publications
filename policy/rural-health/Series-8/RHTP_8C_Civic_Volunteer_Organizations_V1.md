# RHTP 8.C
# Civic and Volunteer Organizations
## Community Glue in an Era of Dissolution

*Series 8: Community Organizations*
*Rural Health Transformation Project*

## Introduction

Rural America once sustained dense networks of civic organizations that structured community life. Rotary clubs connected business owners. Lions clubs funded vision care. Kiwanis clubs supported youth. Volunteer fire departments protected neighbors. Community foundations channeled local philanthropy. Veterans organizations honored service. These organizations provided **social contact, mutual aid, and community identity** in places where formal institutions were sparse.

RHTP assumes these organizations exist and can contribute to health transformation. The assumption is increasingly problematic. **Civic organization membership has declined dramatically over decades**, with acceleration in recent years. What remains often serves aging memberships without younger replacements. The volunteer infrastructure that once held rural communities together has thinned considerably.

This article examines the **core tension between small scale and program scale**. Civic organizations operate at modest scope by design. A Lions club with 15 members running vision screenings operates effectively at that scale. RHTP operates at larger scale, requiring regional coordination, professional management, and substantial administrative capacity. The question is whether small-scale civic organizations can contribute to larger-scale transformation, or whether the scale mismatch makes meaningful participation impossible.

The honest answer: **civic organizations can contribute connection and convening, but not program implementation**. Expecting them to manage subawards, meet reporting requirements, or coordinate regional initiatives misunderstands what these organizations are and what they can do. Leveraging what they do well requires accepting what they cannot provide.

## The Civic Organization Landscape

### Service Clubs: Documented Decline

Service clubs represent the most systematically documented decline in American civic infrastructure. Robert Putnam's *Bowling Alone* captured the trend in 2000: attendance at club meetings such as Rotary and Kiwanis had declined **58% between 1975 and 2000**. The quarter-century since has only accelerated erosion.

**Rotary International** loses more members than it gains each year: approximately 44,000 new members annually against 51,000 departures. The organization's own president has acknowledged a "ROMEO problem," an acronym for "Rich Old Men Eating Out," describing the demographic perception that limits recruitment. Total membership has declined from 386,000 in 2004 to approximately 316,000 by 2024, a nearly 20% drop.

**Lions Clubs** have experienced more severe contraction, with membership declining approximately 60% from peak levels. Local clubs report similar patterns: predominantly retired membership, limited engagement from working-age adults, and uncertainty about organizational continuity.

**Kiwanis** membership has fallen by roughly 40% from historical highs. Local chapters report active membership often reduced to single digits. The Washington, Pennsylvania Kiwanis Club, operating for more than a century, folded in September 2024 with membership reduced to approximately five retirees. **"We've run out of people, run out of steam, and run out of energy,"** the club secretary reported.

**Iowa Small Town Poll data** provides the most rigorous longitudinal evidence. In 1994, approximately 20% of residents in typical small Iowa towns belonged to fraternal organizations (Kiwanis, Lions, Optimists, Rotary, Moose, Masons, Odd Fellows). By 2024, that figure had fallen to **5% to 6%**, a decline of more than two-thirds in thirty years.

| Organization | Peak Membership | Current Estimate | Decline |
|--------------|-----------------|------------------|---------|
| Lions Clubs International | ~1.4 million | ~1.4 million (global) | 60% (US specific) |
| Rotary International | 386,000 (2004) | 316,000 (2024) | 18% |
| Kiwanis International | Not specified | Varied | ~40% from peak |
| Fraternal orgs (Iowa towns) | 20% of residents | 5-6% of residents | 70% |

### Volunteer Fire Departments: Crisis Infrastructure

Volunteer fire departments face an existential crisis with direct public safety implications. The National Fire Protection Association reported approximately **676,900 volunteer firefighters in 2020**, a 6% decrease from the previous year and the lowest number ever recorded. Since 1984, volunteer firefighter numbers have decreased by 25% while the U.S. population grew by 40%.

The demographics compound the crisis. **Departments protecting fewer than 2,500 people have the highest percentage of firefighters over age 50 (34%)**. In many rural areas, volunteers in their 60s and 70s remain active because no younger replacements exist. A 50-year volunteer in Lakeview, Ohio described the situation: his department lost approximately seven to ten firefighters in two years, with people moving away or changing jobs.

The scope mismatch between traditional volunteerism and modern requirements drives much of the decline:
- **Training requirements** have expanded dramatically, consuming hundreds of hours
- **Call volumes** have tripled since 1986 while volunteer numbers dropped
- **Economic pressures** leave potential volunteers working multiple jobs with no time for unpaid service
- **Personal protective equipment** costs up to $2,500 per set
- **Career and family dynamics** prevent the commitment to being on-call

Nationally, **87% of fire departments are mostly or entirely volunteer** according to FEMA. These are not supplementary organizations; they are primary emergency infrastructure in thousands of rural communities. When volunteer departments cannot maintain staffing, response times extend from minutes to potentially fatal delays. A New Jersey fire service official framed the consequence directly: **"People are dying because the response is so far."**

### Community Foundations: Capacity Concentration

Community foundations represent an exception to the civic decline narrative, but with important qualifications. Assets have grown, particularly at larger regional foundations. However, **philanthropic capacity remains geographically concentrated**, and rural community foundations often lack the scale to support significant transformation initiatives.

Rural counties, home to 15-20% of the U.S. population, receive an estimated **3% of annual philanthropic dollars**. Less than 0.5% of foundation funding reaches Native American communities and causes. The Montana Community Foundation's 2024 experience illustrates the gap: administering $1.5 million through the Otto Bremer Trust Community Responsive Fund, they received 413 pre-applications requesting more than $21.3 million. Only 36 proposals (9%) received funding, leaving 87 proposals from low-capacity counties unfunded.

Typical rural community foundations operate with part-time staff, modest assets, and limited grantmaking capacity:

| Characteristic | Typical Rural Community Foundation |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|
| Assets | $500,000 to $5 million |
| Staff | Part-time director, no other staff |
| Annual grantmaking | $25,000 to $200,000 |
| Governance | Volunteer board, often aging |
| Management capacity | Basic grant administration |

These organizations serve important roles in their communities: managing donor-advised funds, distributing scholarships, supporting local nonprofits. **They are not equipped to serve as fiscal sponsors for multi-million dollar federal initiatives** requiring quarterly reporting, outcome tracking, and audit compliance.

### Veterans Organizations and Fraternal Groups

Veterans of Foreign Wars, American Legion, Moose, Elks, and Masons have all experienced membership erosion. **The Masons have lost over 70% of membership** since peak levels. Veterans organizations face demographic inevitability as World War II and Korean War veterans pass and Vietnam-era veterans age.

These organizations retain buildings, gathering spaces, and organizational infrastructure in many rural communities. However, declining membership means these assets are increasingly underutilized, and organizational capacity to take on new initiatives has shrunk correspondingly.

## The Scale Tension

### What Small Organizations Do Well

Civic organizations at modest scale perform several functions effectively:

**Community connection**: Regular meetings create social contact for members who might otherwise experience isolation. In communities where other gathering opportunities have disappeared, service club meetings provide consistent human interaction.

**Volunteer coordination**: Organizing volunteers for specific, time-limited activities remains achievable. Vision screenings, coat drives, bell-ringing campaigns, and similar discrete projects work within small organization capacity.

**Local philanthropy**: Distributing modest grants to local causes, funding scholarships, and supporting community projects all fall within typical capacity. A Lions club contributing $5,000 annually to various community needs operates effectively.

**Community knowledge**: Long-term members possess institutional memory and community relationships that outside organizations cannot replicate. They know who needs help, who can help, and how to navigate local dynamics.

**Convening legitimacy**: Inviting community members to discuss issues carries weight when the invitation comes from established, trusted local organizations.

### What Small Organizations Cannot Do

RHTP implementation requires capabilities that small civic organizations fundamentally lack:

**Professional grant management**: Federal subawards require financial controls, documentation systems, and reporting capacity that volunteer-led organizations cannot provide. A part-time community foundation director managing $2 million in assets cannot absorb a $500,000 RHTP subaward requiring quarterly reports, outcome metrics, and audit compliance.

**Continuous operations**: Service clubs meet weekly or monthly. RHTP programs require daily attention. Volunteer organizations structured around periodic gatherings cannot manage ongoing service delivery.

**Staff capacity**: Transformation programs require paid staff to handle administration, coordination, and implementation. Organizations operating entirely on volunteer labor have no mechanism to add this capacity without fundamentally changing their character.

**Regional coordination**: RHTP operates at county or multi-county scale. Individual civic organizations operate at community or neighborhood scale. Connecting small organizations into regional networks requires intermediary capacity that often does not exist.

**Risk absorption**: Small organizations lack reserves to manage cash flow uncertainty, weather implementation challenges, or absorb program failures. A $50,000 annual budget organization cannot survive a $200,000 program that fails to achieve objectives.

### The Vignette: Foundation Capacity Mismatch

The Jefferson County Community Foundation had served its rural community for 15 years. With $2.3 million in assets, a part-time executive director, and a volunteer board of local business owners and retirees, the foundation distributed approximately $75,000 annually in scholarships and community grants.

When the state health department sought fiscal sponsors for county-level RHTP initiatives, they approached the foundation about administering $800,000 over three years for community health worker deployment and social care navigation. The role would include managing subcontracts with healthcare providers, tracking outcome metrics, preparing quarterly reports, and coordinating with multiple state agencies.

The board debated for two months. Proponents saw an opportunity for transformative community impact, greater organizational profile, and significant indirect cost revenue. Skeptics worried the role would overwhelm existing capacity, change the foundation's community relationships, and put the endowment at risk if programs underperformed.

They ultimately declined. **The foundation's part-time director managed perhaps 20 hours weekly of administrative work**. The RHTP role would require at least one full-time position plus accounting support. Hiring staff would consume the indirect cost revenue. The foundation's existing donors contributed for scholarships and local grants, not federal program administration. Taking on a role ten times larger than current operations seemed more likely to destroy what worked than to enhance it.

The state found another fiscal agent, a larger regional nonprofit based 90 miles away with established federal grant experience. The community lost the opportunity for locally administered transformation. But the foundation continued serving its modest, sustainable role: **precisely what it was built to do**.

## The Community Capacity Skepticism

The alternative perspective deserving serious assessment holds that **civic capacity has eroded beyond recovery in many rural communities**. Decades of population decline, economic stress, and outmigration of young adults have depleted the volunteer base. What remains is fragile, aging, and unable to absorb additional demands.

### Evidence Supporting Skepticism

The Iowa Small Town Poll data provides the strongest support. A decline from 20% to 5% civic organization membership over thirty years represents **structural change, not cyclical variation**. Communities cannot quickly rebuild infrastructure that took decades to erode.

Volunteer firefighter demographics reinforce the pattern. When a 50-year-old member is "one of the young guys" at the firehouse, the organization faces generational discontinuity that recruitment campaigns cannot easily address. The underlying cause is not inadequate marketing but **demographic and economic transformation** that removed potential volunteers from rural communities entirely.

Urban migration continues. Since 1980, the urban share of U.S. population has grown from approximately 70% to over 85%. Rural communities continue losing young adults who might otherwise replace aging civic organization members. **The people who would rebuild civic infrastructure have largely moved to cities**.

### Evidence Questioning Skepticism

Civic capacity varies dramatically across communities. Some rural areas retain strong civic infrastructure while others have lost nearly all organizational capacity. **Assessment should replace assumption**.

Successful recruitment examples exist. The Granbury, Texas volunteer fire department grew from 37 to 68 members plus 13 probationary members through intentional messaging and community outreach. When organizations invest in recruitment with creativity and persistence, some succeed. But success requires resources (Granbury benefits from better local government funding than most rural departments) and circumstances that not all communities share.

Community foundations have grown in some regions. Major foundations like Montana Community Foundation manage substantial assets and increasingly recognize rural gaps. **Intermediary models** channeling foundation resources to rural areas show promise, though reach remains limited.

### Assessment

The skepticism has substantial validity for many communities, but overgeneralizes from depleted areas to all rural America. **The honest answer is that civic capacity varies enormously**, from communities with multiple active service clubs and robust volunteer infrastructure to communities where organized civic life has essentially disappeared.

RHTP implementation should assess actual capacity rather than assuming either presence or absence. States that **map civic infrastructure before programming** can match strategies to reality. Communities with capacity can support community-engaged transformation. Communities without capacity require alternative approaches.

## RHTP Role Analysis

### Current State Approaches

| State | Civic Organization Role | Mechanism | Assessment |
|-------|------------------------|-----------|------------|
| Kentucky | Community foundations as regional hubs | Fiscal sponsorship | Mixed capacity |
| Tennessee | Service clubs for community outreach | Volunteer mobilization | Limited scope |
| North Carolina | Community action agencies | Implementation partners | Higher capacity |
| Texas | Variable by region | No systematic engagement | Capacity varies dramatically |
| West Virginia | Faith-based over civic | Churches predominant | Civic infrastructure limited |
| Montana | Tribal and community foundations | Dual track | Capacity building needed |

Most states do not systematically engage civic organizations in RHTP implementation. When engagement occurs, it typically involves convening functions (gathering community input) rather than program management. This reflects realistic assessment of civic organization capacity.

### Appropriate Roles

**Connection and convening**: Civic organizations can host community meetings, provide gathering space, and legitimate community engagement processes. A Lions club inviting members to discuss community health needs carries weight that state health department outreach cannot replicate.

**Volunteer coordination**: Specific, time-limited volunteer activities remain achievable. Organizing transportation volunteers for medical appointments, staffing health fair booths, or supporting community health worker outreach events all fall within typical capacity.

**Community voice**: Long-standing organizations can represent community perspectives in transformation planning. Their knowledge of local dynamics, relationships, and history provides value that outside organizations cannot access independently.

**Local philanthropy**: Community foundations can support transformation through their normal grantmaking, funding local match requirements or sustaining programs after federal funding ends.

### Inappropriate Roles

**Fiscal sponsorship**: Managing federal subawards requires capacity that most civic organizations lack. Even well-functioning community foundations typically cannot absorb programs multiple times larger than their normal operations.

**Program implementation**: Continuous service delivery exceeds volunteer organization capacity. Programs requiring daily management, staff supervision, and outcome tracking need professional organizational capacity.

**Regional coordination**: Connecting multiple communities or counties requires intermediary infrastructure. Individual civic organizations operating at community scale cannot coordinate regional transformation.

## State and Regional Variation

### Why Capacity Varies

**Population stability**: Communities retaining working-age residents maintain larger volunteer pools. Communities experiencing persistent outmigration have depleted civic capacity regardless of historical strength.

**Economic conditions**: Prosperity enables civic participation. When residents work multiple jobs to survive economically, volunteer time disappears. Communities with stable employment and moderate prosperity sustain stronger civic organizations.

**Civic tradition**: Some regions have deeper traditions of civic participation that partially buffer against decline. Upper Midwest communities often retain stronger civic infrastructure than comparable communities elsewhere.

**State policy environment**: States providing volunteer firefighter tax credits, liability protections, and other support experience somewhat less volunteer erosion. Policy cannot reverse structural trends but can moderate decline.

**Institutional anchors**: Communities with colleges, regional hospitals, or major employers retain populations and institutions that support civic life. Communities without anchors face compounding erosion.

### The Vignette: Two Counties, Different Realities

Hamilton County has a community college, a regional hospital, and several manufacturing facilities that survived deindustrialization. Population has remained stable for two decades. The county seat's Rotary club maintains 45 members, including hospital administrators, college faculty, and business owners. The volunteer fire department operates with 28 active members, including several college students earning EMT certification. The community foundation manages $8 million in assets with a full-time director.

When the state sought community partners for RHTP implementation, Hamilton County had options. The community foundation could manage modest subawards. Civic organizations could support community engagement. The volunteer fire department could integrate with emergency medical services transformation. **Infrastructure existed to support transformation**.

Jefferson County, 80 miles away, presents a different reality. The county lost its hospital a decade ago. The manufacturing plant closed in 2008. Young adults leave after high school graduation. Population has declined 25% since 2000. The Kiwanis club disbanded last year with five remaining members. The volunteer fire department struggles to field responders; average age exceeds 55. The community foundation operates with $400,000 in assets and a volunteer administrator.

When the state sought partners in Jefferson County, it found few options. No organization had capacity for subaward management. Community engagement meant reaching residents through churches and the county extension office. **Transformation programming required external capacity or alternative approaches**.

The two counties demonstrate why **assessment must precede programming**. Assuming either presence or absence of civic capacity produces mismatched strategies.

## When Civic Organizations Can Support Transformation

Conditions enabling effective participation:

**Stable organizations with active membership**: Organizations with more than 20 active members, regular meetings, and leadership succession have capacity for modest roles. Organizations with fewer than 10 members struggling to maintain current activities cannot absorb additional demands.

**Leadership capacity beyond current activities**: When existing leadership can accommodate new responsibilities without overwhelming current operations, participation becomes feasible. When leadership is already stretched to maintain basic functions, adding transformation roles undermines everything.

**Network connections enabling coordination**: Organizations connected to regional networks, other civic groups, or intermediary organizations can participate in coordinated efforts. Isolated organizations lack pathways to regional transformation.

**Role scope matched to organizational capacity**: Convening, volunteer coordination, and community voice functions match civic organization capacity. Program management and fiscal sponsorship typically exceed capacity.

## When Civic Organizations Cannot Support Transformation

Conditions precluding effective participation:

**Declining organizations struggling to maintain current activities**: Organizations losing members, with aging leadership and uncertain futures, cannot take on new responsibilities. Adding transformation roles hastens organizational collapse.

**Aging membership without succession**: When no younger members are positioned to assume leadership, organizations face generational discontinuity within years. Long-term transformation commitments become impossible.

**Isolation without network connections**: Organizations lacking connections to other civic groups, intermediaries, or regional infrastructure have no pathway to coordinated transformation participation.

**Roles requiring capacity organizations do not have**: Federal grant management, continuous program operation, and staff supervision require professional organizational capacity that volunteer organizations cannot develop quickly.

**Alternative approaches for these contexts**: Healthcare-led transformation with community input rather than community-led transformation. Intermediary organizations providing capacity that local civic infrastructure cannot. State direct implementation rather than community partnership. Accepting that some communities lack civic infrastructure to engage.

## Assessment and Recommendations

### For Civic Organizations

**Honest self-assessment**: Evaluate actual capacity for transformation participation. How many active members? What is leadership capacity? Can the organization absorb additional responsibilities without undermining current functions?

**Contribute what you do well**: Offer convening, community voice, volunteer coordination, and local knowledge. These contributions have genuine value without requiring capacity organizations lack.

**Decline roles exceeding capacity**: When states or healthcare partners propose roles requiring professional grant management, continuous operations, or staff capacity, declining protects organizational integrity. Taking on roles destined to fail serves no one.

**Build capacity over time if transformation participation is desired**: Capacity building takes years. Organizations wanting larger transformation roles should invest in systems, staff, and infrastructure now for future opportunities.

### For State Agencies

**Conduct capacity assessment before assuming community partnership**: Map civic infrastructure at county level. Identify which communities have organizational capacity, which have emerging capacity, and which lack civic infrastructure entirely.

**Differentiate strategies based on actual capacity**: In communities with strong civic infrastructure, community-engaged transformation makes sense. In communities lacking civic capacity, use alternative approaches rather than pretending capacity exists.

**Leverage civic organizations for connection and convening**: These functions match organizational capacity. Expecting program management typically does not.

**Fund capacity building where potential exists**: Some communities have organizations that could develop greater capacity with investment. Multi-year capacity building grants can strengthen civic infrastructure, but results take time.

**Use intermediary organizations where local capacity is absent**: Regional nonprofits, healthcare systems, or state agencies can implement transformation in communities lacking local civic capacity. This is not failure; it is realistic response to actual conditions.

### For Healthcare Partners

**Value civic organizations for authentic community voice**: Long-standing organizations know their communities. This knowledge has value even when organizations lack program implementation capacity.

**Avoid overwhelming small organizations with partnership demands**: Requests for community partnership often translate into unfunded work that strains volunteer organizations. Be specific about what partnership entails and realistic about organizational capacity.

**Build community capacity rather than extracting community legitimacy**: Some healthcare partnerships use community organization names for legitimacy while providing nothing in return. Genuine partnership builds organizational capacity rather than depleting it.

**Accept that some communities lack partner organizations**: Not every community has civic infrastructure to engage. In these contexts, healthcare-led implementation with community input may be the only viable approach.

### For CMS

**Allow states flexibility to adapt to varying community capacity**: One-size-fits-all community engagement requirements ignore dramatic variation in civic infrastructure. States need flexibility to match approaches to actual capacity.

**Do not require community partnership where capacity does not exist**: Mandating community organization participation in communities lacking civic infrastructure produces compliance theater rather than genuine engagement.

**Measure community engagement quality, not just quantity**: Number of community meetings or partner organizations says little about engagement quality. Assessment should examine whether community voice actually influences transformation decisions.

## Conclusion

Civic organizations in rural America have experienced decades of decline that RHTP cannot reverse. **Service club membership has fallen by two-thirds in many communities**. Volunteer fire departments face existential crisis. Community foundations typically lack capacity for major program management. The civic infrastructure that once structured rural community life has thinned considerably.

This reality does not eliminate roles for civic organizations in transformation. Connection and convening, volunteer coordination, community voice, and local philanthropy all remain achievable functions. What civic organizations cannot provide is professional program implementation, federal grant management, or regional coordination capacity.

**Assessment must precede programming**. Some rural communities retain robust civic infrastructure capable of meaningful transformation partnership. Many do not. States that map actual capacity can match strategies to reality rather than assuming either universal presence or universal absence of civic organizations.

The alternative perspective holding that civic capacity has eroded beyond recovery overgeneralizes but captures important truth. In many communities, the organizational infrastructure that could support transformation does not exist and cannot be quickly created. Alternative approaches, including healthcare-led implementation, intermediary organizations, and state direct engagement, become necessary where civic capacity is absent.

RHTP cannot build community infrastructure that decades of demographic and economic change have depleted. It can strengthen infrastructure that exists. It should not pretend capacity is present when it is not.
