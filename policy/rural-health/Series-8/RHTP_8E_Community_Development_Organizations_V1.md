## Building Beyond Healthcare While Depending on Healthcare Funding

**Series 8: Community Organizations**

Community development organizations occupy a peculiar position in rural health transformation. They exist to address the determinants of health without being healthcare organizations. **CDFIs finance small businesses and affordable housing. Housing organizations rehabilitate substandard homes. Economic development entities recruit employers and support entrepreneurs.** These activities shape health outcomes without delivering healthcare services. RHTP's emphasis on social determinants of health creates partnership opportunities that did not exist before. It also creates risks that transformation funding may distort organizations built for different purposes.

The core tension is **mission sustainability versus grant dependency**. Community development organizations typically operate on thin margins with diversified funding from federal programs, foundations, and earned revenue. RHTP partnership offers substantial resources but concentrates funding in healthcare, potentially reshaping organizational priorities around a funding source that ends in 2030. Organizations face a difficult calculation: accept transformation resources and risk becoming dependent on healthcare funding, or decline participation and forfeit the opportunity to strengthen community infrastructure during a rare moment of investment.

This article examines whether community development organizations can support rural health transformation, what conditions enable effective partnership, and what happens when healthcare funding ends. The evidence suggests that **mission-aligned partnerships work; mission-distorting partnerships fail**. Organizations that integrate RHTP activities into existing community development work build lasting capacity. Organizations that reshape themselves around healthcare funding face collapse when funding disappears.

**Information Limits**

Analysis relies on organizational data, CDFI performance reports, and housing program evaluations. What these data cannot capture is the internal deliberation that shapes partnership decisions or the long-term effects of funding concentration. The 2030 funding cliff has not arrived. Whether RHTP-built capacity survives remains speculation informed by prior grant-dependency patterns.

## The Community Development Landscape

### CDFIs in Rural America

As of February 2025, **1,427 certified Community Development Financial Institutions** operate nationwide, including 68 Native CDFIs serving tribal communities. These include 561 loan funds, 496 credit unions, 196 banks or thrifts, 160 depository institution holding companies, and 14 venture capital funds operating in rural, urban, and suburban areas across all 50 states and the District of Columbia.

Rural CDFIs constitute a smaller share of the total than their urban counterparts, reflecting both population distribution and the challenges of operating mission-driven finance in thin markets. Rural areas present particular difficulties: smaller loan sizes mean higher per-loan costs, geographic dispersion increases servicing expenses, and limited population bases constrain lending volume.

| Characteristic | Rural CDFIs | All CDFIs |
|----------------|-------------|-----------|
| Estimated number | ~200-250 | 1,427 |
| Primary loan types | Small business, housing, facilities | Varied |
| Median loan size | $25,000-$75,000 | $50,000-$150,000 |
| Net charge-off rate | ~1.0-1.5% | ~1.0% |
| Primary funding sources | CDFI Fund, banks, foundations | Varied |

The CDFI Fund within the Treasury Department provides financial and technical assistance awards to certified CDFIs. In fiscal year 2024, CDFI Fund program award recipients financed more than 109,000 businesses and provided capital for community facilities, affordable housing, and economic development. The Healthy Food Financing Initiative has made 84 awards totaling $155.1 million to CDFIs in 18 states since 2015, addressing food access in underserved areas.

**Rural CDFIs already address social determinants of health**, though they may not frame their work in healthcare terminology. Small business lending creates employment with wages and benefits. Housing finance improves living conditions that affect respiratory health, mental health, and family stability. Community facility loans support clinics, schools, and childcare centers. The connection to health exists; RHTP makes it explicit and funded.

### Housing Organizations

Rural housing organizations include **Community Housing Development Organizations (CHDOs)**, nonprofit housing developers, community land trusts, and organizations that provide housing repair and rehabilitation services. These entities address housing affordability, quality, and stability through development, lending, and direct service provision.

As of 2024, more than **300 community land trusts** operate across 48 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. CLTs separate ownership of land from ownership of structures, maintaining permanent affordability while enabling wealth building for homeowners. Research indicates CLT homeowners experience lower foreclosure rates, greater housing stability, and reduced financial hardship compared to market-rate homeowners.

The connection between housing and health is well documented. Stable, affordable housing reduces chronic stress that contributes to hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and mental health conditions. Quality housing eliminates exposure to lead paint, mold, and other environmental hazards that cause respiratory illness and developmental delays. Housing stability enables consistent employment, medication adherence, and healthcare access.

**Rural housing organizations face particular challenges.** Thin real estate markets limit development opportunities. Scattered housing stock increases rehabilitation costs. Aging housing infrastructure requires substantial investment. The workforce for housing repair and construction is limited in rural areas. Organizations operating in these conditions typically have small staffs, modest budgets, and limited capacity for expansion.

### Economic Development Entities

Economic development organizations in rural areas include **regional planning commissions, economic development districts, chambers of commerce, and revolving loan funds**. These entities work to attract employers, support entrepreneurs, develop workforce skills, and improve infrastructure that enables economic activity.

The connection to health operates through employment and income. Job loss correlates with increased mortality, depression, and substance use. Economic instability in communities affects collective health through reduced tax bases, service cuts, and population decline. Economic development that creates stable employment with health insurance directly improves population health outcomes.

Rural economic development organizations vary dramatically in capacity. Some regions have sophisticated entities with professional staff, substantial revolving loan funds, and established relationships with state and federal programs. Others have minimal infrastructure: volunteer boards, part-time staff, and limited resources. This variation in capacity shapes the potential for RHTP partnership.

## The Core Tension: Mission Sustainability vs. Grant Dependency

### The Sustainability Imperative View

**Organizations should not build capacity they cannot sustain.** Grant-funded programs often collapse when grants end. RHTP provides five years of funding with no guarantee of renewal. Organizations that reshape themselves around healthcare funding risk losing not only the healthcare programs but also the organizational stability they had before RHTP.

This view emphasizes several concerns:

**Mission drift undermines organizational identity.** A CDFI exists to provide capital access in underserved markets. A housing organization exists to improve housing conditions. When healthcare funding becomes dominant, organizations may redirect attention from core mission to healthcare-aligned activities that qualify for funding. Staff hired for healthcare programs may lack expertise in core functions. Board attention may shift to healthcare partnerships. The organization becomes something different than what it was built to be.

**Funding concentration creates fragility.** Diversified funding protects organizations from the loss of any single source. Organizations with multiple federal programs, foundation grants, and earned revenue can survive changes in any one stream. Concentrating funding in RHTP creates dependence on a single source that will end. Prudent management maintains diversification rather than accepting concentration.

**The 2030 cliff is real.** RHTP funding ends. Organizations that have grown to depend on RHTP resources will face sudden revenue loss. Positions created with RHTP funds will be eliminated. Programs built with RHTP support will end. The capacity that appeared during the funding period will disappear after it.

### The Opportunity Reality View

**Refusing transformation funding because it might end abandons communities now.** Rural communities face immediate needs that RHTP can address. Waiting for perfect sustainability guarantees means waiting forever. Some capacity built during funded periods will persist through organizational learning, relationship building, and demonstrated value that attracts replacement funding.

This view offers several counterarguments:

**Healthcare and community development are naturally aligned.** Housing affects health. Employment affects health. Food access affects health. RHTP does not require mission distortion; it funds activities community development organizations already do or should do. Partnership that aligns with existing mission strengthens rather than distorts organizational purpose.

**Capacity building has lasting value.** Staff trained in health-housing connections retain that knowledge after funding ends. Relationships built with healthcare partners persist beyond specific programs. Data systems developed for RHTP reporting serve other purposes. Physical infrastructure remains. Not all capacity disappears with funding.

**Alternatives to RHTP partnership are worse.** Organizations that decline RHTP funding do not thereby become sustainable. They remain underfunded, under-capacity, and limited in impact. The choice is not between RHTP dependency and robust independence; it is between RHTP-supported activity and continued scarcity. Taking the funding and building what capacity can be built is rational.

### What Evidence Would Resolve the Tension

The tension cannot be fully resolved because it depends on what happens after 2030, which cannot be known. However, evidence from prior grant-funded programs suggests several patterns:

**Programs fully integrated into organizational mission survive at higher rates.** When grant-funded activities align with and strengthen core mission, organizations protect them after funding ends through reallocation from other sources. When grant-funded activities are peripheral, they are abandoned.

**Sustainability planning from program inception improves outcomes.** Organizations that build sustainability considerations into partnership design from the beginning fare better than those that address sustainability only when funding end approaches.

**Replacement funding for demonstrated programs exists in some cases.** Activities that document effectiveness and build stakeholder support sometimes attract replacement funding from states, foundations, or other federal programs. This is not guaranteed but is more likely for programs that invest in evaluation and relationship building.

## Organizational Capacity Analysis

| Organization | State/Region | Staff | Budget | Core Functions | Healthcare Role | RHTP Potential | Capacity Assessment |
|--------------|--------------|-------|--------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Southern Bancorp** | AR, MS, TN, LA | ~400 | $42M+ | Banking, lending, community development | Housing, small business for health workforce | High | Strong infrastructure, established health connections |
| **Rural LISC** | National | ~50 rural-focused | $30M+ rural | Technical assistance, capital deployment | SDOH partnerships in 150+ communities | High | Scale and expertise; network model |
| **Fahe** | Appalachian region | ~60 | $25M | Housing finance, community development | Housing quality, stability programs | High | Regional scale, demonstrated health interest |
| **MAY Coalition** | Rural NC | 8 | $2.5M | Small business lending | Employment creation | Moderate | Mission-aligned but limited scale |
| **Federation of Appalachian Housing Enterprises** | Appalachia | 30 | $12M | Housing development, lending | Housing rehabilitation, healthy homes | High | Health connection established |
| **Mountain Association** | Eastern KY | 18 | $4M | Lending, business development | Food systems, economic resilience | Moderate | Mission-aligned, capacity constraints |
| **Hope Enterprise Corporation** | MS, AL, AR, LA, TN | ~200 | $50M+ | Banking, lending, policy | Housing, small business, health facilities | High | Scale, track record, health interest |
| **Coastal Enterprises Inc.** | ME | ~80 | $15M | Lending, fisheries, rural development | Food access, housing, healthcare facilities | High | Diverse portfolio, demonstrated capacity |

### What This Table Reveals

**Large, established CDFIs can absorb RHTP partnership** without organizational distortion. Southern Bancorp and Hope Enterprise Corporation have scale, diversified funding, and existing health-related activities that make RHTP alignment natural. For these organizations, RHTP represents enhancement of existing work rather than new direction.

**Mid-size regional organizations face strategic choices.** Fahe, Coastal Enterprises, and the Federation of Appalachian Housing Enterprises have sufficient capacity for meaningful partnership but must choose how much organizational attention to direct toward healthcare. These organizations can integrate RHTP activities without dependency if they maintain portfolio balance.

**Small community development organizations risk proportional dominance of healthcare funding.** An organization with $2 million budget receiving $500,000 in RHTP-related funding has 25% of revenue from a single source. This concentration creates the dependency risk the sustainability imperative view emphasizes.

## The SDOH Partnership Opportunity

### What RHTP Enables

RHTP explicitly emphasizes social determinants of health, creating opportunities for community development organizations that address those determinants:

**Housing organizations** can partner on healthy homes initiatives that connect housing rehabilitation with health outcomes. Lead paint remediation, weatherization, and accessibility modifications all improve health while aligning with housing mission.

**CDFIs** can finance healthcare workforce housing, medical facilities in underserved areas, and small businesses that provide healthcare employment. Loan products for healthcare-related purposes fit CDFI models while serving RHTP goals.

**Economic development entities** can focus on healthcare sector development, connecting workforce training with healthcare employment needs. Employer recruitment can prioritize healthcare operations that bring both jobs and services to rural areas.

**Community land trusts** can incorporate health considerations into property selection and development, prioritizing locations with access to healthcare services and amenities that support health.

### What RHTP Risks

**Healthcare colonization of community development** occurs when healthcare funding reshapes organizations around healthcare priorities rather than community development mission. Signs of colonization include:

Healthcare partners directing organizational strategy rather than collaborating. Staff evaluation based on healthcare metrics rather than community development outcomes. Board composition shifting toward healthcare expertise at expense of community development knowledge. Organizational identity becoming healthcare-adjacent rather than community development-centered.

**Funding concentration creates vulnerability** even when activities align with mission. An organization doing exactly what it should do becomes fragile if the funding for that work comes predominantly from one source.

**Reporting burdens distort attention** when RHTP documentation requirements consume staff time that would otherwise go to core activities. Community development organizations typically have limited administrative capacity. Healthcare reporting demands may exceed what small organizations can absorb without reducing program delivery.

### Vignette: The CDFI Partnership Decision

*Appalachian Community Lending (a composite drawn from multiple organizations) has provided small business and housing loans in eastern Kentucky for 25 years. The organization has 12 staff, a $6 million operating budget funded by CDFI Fund awards, foundation grants, loan interest, and fee income. It has never worked directly with healthcare systems.*

*Kentucky's RHTP implementation identifies housing quality as a priority intervention. The state seeks CDFI partners to manage healthy homes financing, providing $800,000 annually for three years to support lending for housing rehabilitation that addresses health hazards.*

*ACL's leadership debates the opportunity:*

**The opportunity case:** Housing rehabilitation is core mission. The funding aligns with what ACL does. Three years of enhanced lending capacity could demonstrate a model that attracts ongoing foundation or state support. Healthcare connection could open new funding streams. Declining means another organization gets the resources and the relationship.

**The caution case:** $800,000 is 13% of budget. That is meaningful concentration. The funding requires healthcare-specific reporting ACL has never done. Staff will need training. The healthcare partnership may reshape expectations. What happens in year four when funding ends but community expects continued program?

*ACL leadership decides to accept with conditions: (1) no more than 20% of total budget from healthcare-related funding; (2) sustainability planning begins immediately, with explicit goal of identifying replacement funding; (3) reporting systems built to serve ACL purposes, not only funder requirements; (4) healthcare partnership structured as collaboration, not direction.*

*Three years later, ACL has built healthy homes expertise, established relationships with healthcare partners, and demonstrated outcomes. A regional foundation provides bridge funding while ACL pursues HUD healthy homes grants. The healthcare funding ended; the capacity persists. The conditions that structured the partnership protected organizational integrity.*

**What the vignette reveals:** Strategic partnership with explicit sustainability planning can work. The key is not avoiding partnership but structuring it to prevent dependency and mission distortion.

## RHTP Role Analysis

### Current RHTP Engagement by State

| State | Community Development Role | Funding Mechanism | Functions | Evidence |
|-------|---------------------------|-------------------|-----------|----------|
| **Arkansas** | Southern Bancorp as major partner | Subaward | Housing, small business, health workforce | Established partnership |
| **Kentucky** | Housing organizations for healthy homes | Subaward | Lead remediation, weatherization | Alignment with existing programs |
| **Mississippi** | Hope Enterprise Corporation engaged | Subaward/partner | Community facilities, housing | Ongoing relationship |
| **West Virginia** | CDFIs for housing quality | Subaward | Housing rehabilitation | Limited scale |
| **North Carolina** | Regional CDFIs for SDOH | Subaward | Food access, housing | Multiple organizations |
| **Texas** | Limited CDFI engagement | Minimal | Workforce housing discussion | Underdeveloped |

### What This Analysis Reveals

**States with established community development infrastructure engage CDFIs more effectively.** Arkansas and Mississippi have strong regional CDFIs that already operate at scale and have existing relationships with state agencies. Partnership emerges from infrastructure that exists rather than being created for RHTP purposes.

**States without community development infrastructure cannot manufacture it.** Texas has minimal rural CDFI presence relative to its rural population. RHTP cannot create community development organizations that do not exist. Where infrastructure is absent, transformation must proceed through other mechanisms.

**Healthcare-community development partnerships require translation.** Healthcare systems and community development organizations use different language, measure different outcomes, and operate under different regulatory frameworks. Effective partnership requires investment in relationship building and mutual education that neither RHTP timelines nor budgets may accommodate.

## Alternative Perspective: The Grant Dependency Skepticism

**Many organizations taking RHTP funds will not survive funding end.** The history of federal grant programs suggests that community organizations built around temporary funding frequently collapse. RHTP's five-year timeline is too short to establish sustainability. Organizations taking RHTP funds are setting themselves up for failure.

**Strongest version of this view:** Community development organizations are already fragile. Adding healthcare funding creates apparent capacity that is actually fragile dependency. When funding ends, organizations will have grown to meet RHTP requirements, making the contraction more painful than if they had never participated. Better to build slowly on sustainable revenue than quickly on temporary grants.

**Assessment of this perspective:** The skepticism has substantial historical support. Grant-dependent organizations do frequently fail when grants end. However, the categorical rejection of grant-supported capacity building ignores variation in organizational response. Some organizations do build sustainable capacity through grant-funded periods. The question is what distinguishes organizations that sustain from those that collapse.

Evidence suggests:

**Organizations with diversified funding before RHTP manage RHTP funding better.** Established CDFIs with multiple revenue sources can absorb RHTP funding without concentration. New or struggling organizations that see RHTP as salvation face higher failure risk.

**Mission alignment predicts sustainability.** Activities that align with organizational mission get protected after funding ends. Activities that were pursued only because funding was available get abandoned.

**Leadership matters.** Organizations with leaders who understand sustainability risks and plan for them fare better than those that defer sustainability thinking until funding end approaches.

## State and Regional Variation

### Why Capacity Varies

| Factor | Effect on Community Development Capacity | Examples |
|--------|----------------------------------------|----------|
| **Population density** | Thin markets limit CDFI viability | Great Plains states have few CDFIs |
| **Economic conditions** | Stronger economies support more lending | Upper Midwest has better CDFI presence |
| **Federal program history** | Areas with CDFI Fund investment have infrastructure | Mississippi Delta has Hope Enterprise |
| **Foundation presence** | Philanthropic investment builds capacity | Appalachia has foundation support |
| **State policy** | State CDFI tax credits and programs add resources | Louisiana, NC have state programs |

### Vignette: Same Organization Type, Different Contexts

*Two regional CDFIs serve rural areas with different characteristics:*

**Delta CDFI (Mississippi Delta):** Operates in persistent poverty region with 25% poverty rate, limited banking presence, and weak economy. Demand for credit exceeds supply. CDFI cannot meet all requests. Healthcare partnership offers resources but market conditions mean CDFI would deploy capital regardless. RHTP funding enhances capacity but does not fundamentally change operations. When funding ends, CDFI continues serving market that has always needed more capital than available.

**Plains CDFI (Great Plains):** Operates in agricultural region with 10% poverty rate, adequate banking presence, and stable economy. Demand for mission-driven lending is limited. CDFI struggles to deploy capital in market with alternatives. Healthcare partnership offers direction but also represents significant portion of activity. When funding ends, CDFI may lack other purpose sufficient to sustain operations.

**What the contrast reveals:** Community development capacity and RHTP partnership viability depend on underlying market conditions. Regions with strong demand for community development services can integrate healthcare funding without distortion. Regions with limited demand may see healthcare funding reshape organizational purpose in unsustainable ways.

## Implications for Transformation

### When Community Development Organizations Can Support Transformation

**Mission alignment exists.** RHTP activities should connect naturally to organizational purpose. Housing organizations addressing housing quality, CDFIs financing healthcare-related projects, economic development entities supporting healthcare employment all represent alignment. Activities that require organizational contortion to justify are warning signs.

**Capacity exists for partnership.** Organizations need staff time, management attention, and administrative systems to manage RHTP activities. Those without adequate capacity will struggle regardless of mission alignment.

**Funding concentration remains manageable.** RHTP funding should not exceed 20-25% of organizational revenue. Higher concentration creates dependency that threatens organizational stability.

**Sustainability planning begins immediately.** Organizations that develop sustainability strategies from partnership inception have better outcomes than those that defer thinking until funding end approaches.

### When Community Development Organizations Cannot Support Transformation

**Partnership would reshape mission.** When RHTP activities do not align with organizational purpose, partnership requires becoming a different organization. This transformation may not survive funding end.

**Capacity does not exist.** Organizations without adequate staffing, systems, and leadership cannot manage RHTP partnership effectively. Attempting partnership that exceeds capacity produces poor outcomes for community and organization.

**Market conditions do not support activity.** Community development organizations in regions without underlying demand for their services cannot sustain RHTP-funded activities when funding ends. Partnership may be appropriate during funding period while acknowledging temporary nature.

**Sustainability path does not exist.** Some activities have no plausible sustainability beyond RHTP. Organizations should understand this before accepting funding and make decisions accordingly.

## Assessment and Recommendations

### For Community Development Organizations

**Assess alignment honestly.** Does RHTP partnership connect to organizational mission, or would it require reshaping organizational purpose? Alignment enables sustainable partnership; misalignment predicts problems.

**Maintain funding diversification.** Accept RHTP funding but cap its share of revenue at levels that do not create dependency. Continue pursuing other funding sources throughout RHTP period.

**Build sustainability planning into partnership design.** From partnership inception, identify how activities will continue after RHTP. If sustainability path does not exist, acknowledge the temporary nature and plan accordingly.

**Protect organizational identity.** Partnership should enhance community development capacity, not subordinate it to healthcare priorities. Maintain board composition, staff expertise, and organizational culture aligned with community development mission.

### For State Agencies

**Assess community development infrastructure before designing partnerships.** States with strong CDFIs and housing organizations can pursue community development partnerships. States without this infrastructure should not assume it can be quickly created.

**Structure funding to prevent concentration.** Cap RHTP funding to any single organization at levels that prevent dependency. Spread funding across multiple organizations where possible.

**Invest in translation.** Healthcare systems and community development organizations operate differently. Effective partnership requires investment in relationship building and mutual understanding that does not happen automatically.

**Plan for 2030 from the beginning.** RHTP funding will end. States should begin identifying sustainability pathways for successful community development partnerships well before funding end.

### For Healthcare Partners

**Value community development expertise.** CDFIs and housing organizations understand community development in ways healthcare systems do not. Partnership should draw on this expertise rather than treating community development organizations as contractors implementing healthcare-designed programs.

**Accept that community development serves community development purposes.** Housing organizations exist to improve housing, not to improve health metrics. Health benefits flow from improved housing, but housing organizations should not be evaluated primarily on health outcomes.

**Build relationships, not just contracts.** Sustainable partnership depends on relationships that survive specific funding periods. Healthcare systems that invest in relationship building create possibilities for ongoing collaboration.

## Conclusion

Community development organizations can support rural health transformation where conditions enable effective partnership. Those conditions include mission alignment, adequate organizational capacity, manageable funding concentration, and realistic sustainability planning. Where conditions exist, partnership strengthens both community development and health transformation.

Where conditions do not exist, partnership produces dependency, mission distortion, and eventual failure. Organizations that reshape themselves around healthcare funding face collapse when funding ends. The 2030 cliff is real for organizations that ignore sustainability.

**The evidence favors strategic partnership over categorical acceptance or rejection.** Organizations that approach RHTP funding as opportunity requiring careful management build lasting capacity. Organizations that approach it as salvation or reject it entirely both miss the opportunity that careful partnership provides.

RHTP cannot create community development infrastructure that does not exist. It can strengthen infrastructure that does exist. The distinction matters for transformation strategy. States with strong community development organizations should leverage them. States without should pursue other approaches to SDOH intervention rather than pretending partnership capacity exists where it does not.
