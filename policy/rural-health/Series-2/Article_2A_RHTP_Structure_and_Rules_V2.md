# Article 2A: RHTP Structure and Rules

## The Architecture of Transformation

*Series 2: Federal Policy Architecture*

> *"The Rural Health Transformation Program represents the largest federal investment in rural health infrastructure in American history. Whether it transforms anything depends on understanding what the program actually is, what it can do, and what it cannot."*

## Introduction

The Rural Health Transformation Program exists because rural hospitals kept closing and Congress finally noticed. Between 2010 and 2025, more than 190 rural hospitals shut their doors permanently. Another 700 facilities operated at financial risk. Rural Americans died at rates 20 percent higher than urban residents from conditions that adequate healthcare could have prevented or treated. The political response arrived in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed July 4, 2025, which created a **$50 billion program** to prevent further collapse and build sustainable rural health systems.

**RHTP is not a bailout.** The program explicitly prohibits direct financial support to struggling hospitals. It is not a coverage expansion. The same legislation cut Medicaid by $911 billion, ensuring that coverage contraction would accompany any transformation investment. RHTP is a **competitive grant program** administered through cooperative agreements between CMS and state governments, designed to fund specific transformation activities while requiring states to demonstrate sustainability beyond the program's five-year window.

Understanding RHTP requires grasping both what the program provides and what it withholds. The funding is substantial but constrained. The flexibility is real but bounded. The timeline is fixed and unforgiving. States that misunderstand the program's architecture will waste resources. States that understand it may accomplish meaningful change within tight parameters.

This article explains how RHTP actually works: the funding formula that determines state allocations, the application requirements that shape state plans, the approved uses that define permissible activities, the administrative structure that governs implementation, and the oversight mechanisms that enforce compliance. **Every subsequent analysis of state RHTP strategies depends on this foundation.**

## Statutory Framework

### Legislative Authority

The Rural Health Transformation Program was established under Title V, Section 5201 of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (Public Law 119-21). The legislation passed both chambers of Congress in June 2025 following months of negotiation over Medicaid restructuring, tax provisions, and rural health investments. Senator Lisa Murkowski's reluctance to support the broader package without meaningful rural health provisions reportedly drove the program's inclusion and scale.

**The program authorizes $50 billion over five years**, allocated as $10 billion annually from FY2026 through FY2030. An additional $12 billion within this total is designated specifically for initiatives aligned with Make America Healthy Again priorities, the administration's wellness and prevention agenda. CMS administers the program through the newly created **Office of Rural Health Transformation**, which reports to the CMS Administrator.

RHTP operates through **cooperative agreements** rather than traditional grants. This distinction matters. Cooperative agreements involve substantial federal involvement in program activities, allowing CMS to provide ongoing technical assistance, require specific performance metrics, and adjust program requirements through administrative action rather than legislative amendment. States accept federal oversight as a condition of receiving funds.

### Program Purpose

The statute articulates four primary objectives:

**Prevent rural hospital closures** by supporting financial stabilization and operational transformation. The program cannot provide direct operating subsidies, but it can fund activities that improve hospital financial performance, such as care coordination systems, telehealth infrastructure, and value-based payment transitions.

**Expand healthcare access** in rural and frontier areas through workforce development, technology deployment, and new service delivery models. Access expansion includes both increasing provider supply and reducing barriers that prevent rural residents from utilizing existing services.

**Build sustainable rural health infrastructure** that can continue operating after federal funding ends. Sustainability is not optional. States must demonstrate credible plans for post-2030 continuation of initiatives launched with RHTP funds.

**Promote value-based care transformation** by transitioning rural providers from fee-for-service payment to models that reward quality and outcomes. The program prioritizes payment reform as a pathway to financial sustainability, though evidence on value-based care success in rural settings remains mixed.

## The Funding Formula

### 50/50 Split Structure

RHTP allocates the annual $10 billion through a two-part formula. **Fifty percent is distributed equally among all approved states**, creating a baseline of approximately $100 million per state per year regardless of rural population size or health status. The remaining **fifty percent is allocated based on rurality metrics and application scores**, rewarding states with larger rural geographies and stronger technical applications.

The equal distribution component reflects political reality. Every state has rural areas and every senator wanted funding. A purely population-based formula would have concentrated resources in a handful of large states, making passage politically impossible. The 50/50 compromise ensures all states receive substantial funding while providing additional resources to states with greater rural territory.

### Rurality Metrics

The rurality-weighted portion considers multiple geographic factors:

**Land area** contributes to allocation calculations, with larger states receiving credit for greater territory requiring health infrastructure. This metric advantages western states with vast rural expanses over smaller eastern states with equivalent rural populations.

**Population density** inversely affects allocations, with lower density areas receiving more funding per capita. Frontier counties with fewer than six persons per square mile receive enhanced weighting compared to higher-density rural areas.

**Frontier and Remote Area (FAR) codes** provide additional weighting for communities meeting extreme isolation criteria. FAR Level 4 areas, the most isolated, receive maximum consideration in formula calculations.

**Rural-Urban Continuum Codes (RUCC)** classify counties on a 1-9 scale measuring metropolitan influence. Counties with RUCC 8-9 designations (completely rural, not adjacent to metro areas) receive enhanced formula weighting compared to RUCC 4-6 counties (rural but metro-adjacent).

### Application Scoring

Beyond formula-driven allocation, application quality influences final awards. CMS scores applications on:

**Technical quality of the transformation plan**, including specificity of proposed activities, realistic timelines, adequate staffing, and logical theory of change connecting inputs to outcomes.

**MAHA policy alignment**, with points awarded for state initiatives supporting Make America Healthy Again priorities. States implementing SNAP purchase restrictions, fitness programs, and prevention initiatives receive scoring advantages.

**Stakeholder engagement documentation**, demonstrating meaningful consultation with providers, community organizations, tribal governments, and other affected parties during application development.

**Prior rural health program performance**, recognizing states with track records of effective implementation in Flex Program, SHIP, and other federal rural health initiatives.

### The Scale Penalty

The formula creates systematic disadvantage for states with large rural populations. **Texas has 4.7 million rural residents, the largest rural population nationally.** It received $281.3 million in FY2026, the highest absolute award. Divided by rural population, this equals approximately **$60 per rural resident**.

**Alaska has 250,000 rural residents.** It received $272.2 million, yielding **$368 per rural resident**. Wyoming, with fewer than 300,000 rural residents, receives over $400 per capita.

The University of Pennsylvania Leonard Davis Institute analyzed RHTP allocations for Senator Ron Wyden's office. Their findings revealed **an inverse relationship between health need and funding levels**. States with the lowest rural mortality rates receive approximately twice as much RHTP funding per rural resident as states with the highest mortality rates. The formula rewards geographic rurality over health outcomes.

| State | Rural Population | FY2026 Award | Per Rural Resident |
|-------|------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Alaska | 250,000 | $272.2M | $368 |
| Wyoming | 280,000 | ~$200M | $400+ |
| Montana | 550,000 | $233.5M | $425 |
| Texas | 4,700,000 | $281.3M | $60 |
| California | 2,700,000 | $233.6M | $87 |
| Mississippi | 1,600,000 | ~$190M | $119 |

This is the scale penalty. Large rural states receive the largest absolute awards but the smallest per-capita investments. The formula advantages sparse settlement over concentrated need, geographic isolation over mortality burden, frontier designation over population health outcomes.

Whether this represents poor program design or necessary political compromise depends on perspective. What it means for implementation is clear: **Texas cannot accomplish what Alaska can with available funding**, despite Texas facing more hospital closures, more coverage gaps, and more preventable deaths.

## Application Requirements

### Eligible Applicants

Only state governments may apply for RHTP funding. Each state designates a lead agency to submit applications and manage implementation. Common lead agency designations include:

**State Departments of Health** serve as lead agencies in most states, leveraging existing rural health expertise and provider relationships.

**State Medicaid Agencies** lead in states where Medicaid transformation aligns closely with RHTP objectives.

**Combined Health and Human Services Agencies** lead in states with consolidated organizational structures.

**State Offices of Rural Health** occasionally serve as lead agencies or co-leads, particularly in states with strong Office of Rural Health capacity.

The single-agency accountability model ensures clear responsibility for program performance. States cannot split RHTP funding across multiple independent agencies, though lead agencies routinely partner with other state entities during implementation.

### Required Consultations

Applications must document meaningful engagement with specified stakeholders:

**State Medicaid Agency** consultation is mandatory regardless of which agency leads RHTP implementation. Medicaid alignment affects sustainability planning and care coordination design.

**State Office of Rural Health** consultation ensures integration with existing rural health initiatives and avoids duplication of Flex Program and other federal investments.

**Tribal affairs offices** must be consulted in states with federally recognized tribes. Consultation requirements recognize tribal sovereignty while ensuring RHTP investments complement rather than supplant Indian Health Service programs.

**Provider and community stakeholders** must participate in application development. CMS evaluates whether stakeholder input meaningfully shaped proposed activities or merely provided political cover for predetermined plans.

### Plan Components

Applications must include a **Comprehensive Rural Health Transformation Plan** addressing:

**Needs assessment** documenting rural health challenges, infrastructure gaps, workforce shortages, and population health status. Assessments must use current data and identify priority areas for intervention.

**Strategic initiatives** specifying proposed activities in at least three of ten approved use categories. Initiatives must include measurable objectives, implementation timelines, responsible parties, and resource requirements.

**Performance metrics** defining how success will be measured. States select from CMS-approved metrics and may propose additional state-specific measures. Metrics must be quantifiable and trackable through existing or proposed data systems.

**Governance structure** explaining how the lead agency will coordinate with partners, manage subawards, monitor performance, and ensure accountability.

**Sustainability plan** describing how initiatives will continue after FY2030. States must identify alternative funding sources, demonstrate partner commitments, and explain transition strategies.

## Approved Uses of Funds

### Ten Statutory Categories

RHTP funds may only support activities falling within ten congressionally authorized categories:

**1. Evidence-based prevention and chronic disease management.** Programs addressing diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and other chronic conditions through lifestyle intervention, care management, and community-based prevention. Alignment with MAHA priorities is expected.

**2. Provider payments for specified health services.** States may use RHTP to enhance provider reimbursement for specific services, though not for general operating support. Payments must be tied to defined services, quality measures, or transformation activities.

**3. Consumer-facing technology for chronic disease management.** Mobile applications, remote monitoring devices, patient portals, and digital health tools that enable patients to manage chronic conditions. Technology must be accessible to rural populations with limited broadband and digital literacy.

**4. Training and technical assistance for technology adoption.** Support for providers implementing new health IT systems, telehealth platforms, and care coordination tools. Includes both initial training and ongoing technical support.

**5. Clinical workforce recruitment and retention.** Loan repayment, signing bonuses, relocation assistance, housing support, and other incentives to attract and keep providers in rural areas. **Requires five-year minimum service commitments** to prevent immediate departure after incentive receipt.

**6. IT advances for efficiency, cybersecurity, and patient outcomes.** Health information exchange, interoperability improvements, electronic health record optimization, cybersecurity infrastructure, and data analytics platforms.

**7. Right-sizing healthcare delivery systems.** Restructuring rural health infrastructure to match community needs, including hospital service line adjustments, facility conversions, regional network development, and care delivery redesign.

**8. Opioid use disorder, substance use disorder, and mental health services.** Expanding behavioral health access through workforce development, telehealth, hub-and-spoke treatment models, and integration with primary care.

**9. Value-based care arrangements and alternative payment models.** Transitioning rural providers from fee-for-service to accountable care organizations, bundled payments, global budgets, and other payment reforms.

**10. Additional uses promoting sustainable rural health access.** Catch-all category for innovative approaches not fitting neatly into other categories, subject to CMS approval.

### Critical Restrictions

Certain uses are explicitly prohibited regardless of how they might be characterized:

**RHTP cannot backfill Medicaid cuts.** The same legislation that created RHTP reduced Medicaid spending by $911 billion over ten years. States cannot use RHTP to replace lost Medicaid revenue. New Jersey's application acknowledged this restriction explicitly while noting the state faced $3.3 billion in projected hospital and public health funding cuts.

**RHTP cannot provide direct operating subsidies.** Hospitals facing insolvency cannot receive RHTP funds to cover operating losses. States may fund transformation activities that improve financial performance, but not general financial support to keep facilities open.

**RHTP must fund transformation, not maintenance.** Activities must represent new capabilities, expanded services, or system changes. Continuing existing programs without enhancement does not qualify. The distinction between transformation and maintenance is sometimes ambiguous, but CMS guidance emphasizes that RHTP investments should create durable change, not temporarily sustain status quo operations.

## Program Administration

### Oversight Structure

CMS assigns project officers to each state for ongoing monitoring and technical assistance. Project officers review quarterly reports, participate in state stakeholder meetings, and serve as primary federal contacts for implementation questions.

**Quarterly progress reports** document activity against plan milestones, financial expenditures, emerging challenges, and course corrections. Reports follow standardized templates enabling cross-state comparison while allowing narrative explanation of state-specific circumstances.

**Annual performance reviews** assess whether states are meeting stated objectives and maintaining policy alignment. Reviews consider both quantitative metrics and qualitative implementation quality. Poor performance triggers enhanced monitoring, technical assistance requirements, or funding adjustments.

**Annual CMS Rural Health Summit** convenes state leaders, federal officials, and stakeholders to share best practices, address common challenges, and build peer learning networks. The first summit occurs during the 2026 CMS Quality Conference.

### Cooperative Agreement Framework

Unlike traditional grants where recipients operate independently, RHTP cooperative agreements involve **substantial federal involvement**:

**Technical assistance** is available from CMS-contracted organizations providing expertise in telehealth implementation, workforce development, care coordination, and other transformation domains. States are expected to utilize available technical assistance rather than solving problems independently.

**Peer learning networks** connect state officials facing similar challenges. CMS facilitates structured sharing of implementation lessons, successful strategies, and cautionary tales.

**Best practice dissemination** occurs through CMS publications, webinars, and the annual summit. States achieving notable success are expected to share approaches with peers.

### Spending Requirements

**States must obligate FY2026 funds by September 30, 2027.** This two-year obligation deadline forces rapid implementation. States cannot wait for perfect plans or extended stakeholder processes. The timeline from award announcement (December 29, 2025) to obligation deadline provides approximately 21 months to structure subawards, execute contracts, and initiate activities.

The requirement has competing implications. It forces action, preventing states from allowing funds to languish while committees deliberate. It also risks hasty decisions, potentially favoring shovel-ready projects over more impactful but slower-developing initiatives. States must balance speed and quality, launching activities quickly enough to meet deadlines while maintaining strategic focus.

Unobligated funds return to CMS for reallocation in subsequent fiscal years. States that fail to obligate risk losing not only current-year funding but also credibility for future awards.

## Clawback and Recalculation

### Annual Re-Scoring

The Office of Rural Health Transformation reviews state performance annually against:

**Stated performance metrics.** Did the state achieve what it said it would achieve? Metrics vary by state based on application commitments, but all states face accountability for promised outcomes.

**Continued policy alignment.** Is the state maintaining MAHA-aligned policies that contributed to initial scoring? A state that adopted SNAP restrictions for application advantage but subsequently reversed them faces scoring penalty.

**Implementation quality.** Beyond metrics, is the state making genuine progress on transformation? CMS evaluators assess whether activities constitute meaningful change or paper compliance.

### Clawback Authority

CMS Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz characterized clawback provisions as **"leverage governors can use to push policies by pointing to the potential loss of millions"** rather than punishment. The framing suggests clawback threat as political tool for advancing MAHA priorities within states.

**Clawback triggers include:** failure to obligate funds within required timelines, substantial deviation from approved transformation plans without CMS approval, material misrepresentation in applications or progress reports, sustained poor performance on stated metrics, and reversal of policy commitments that influenced scoring.

**Due process provisions** require CMS notification of potential clawback, opportunity for state response, and escalation procedures before fund recovery. States facing clawback can appeal to the HHS Departmental Appeals Board, though the timeline for resolution may exceed the program period.

### State Responses to Clawback Risk

States respond to clawback provisions differently based on political orientation and fiscal exposure:

**Republican-led states** generally embrace MAHA alignment, viewing policy requirements as congruent with administration priorities they already support. Clawback risk reinforces existing policy direction.

**Democratic-led states** face tension between policy preferences and funding access. Some adopted MAHA-aligned policies despite ideological discomfort, calculating that funding benefits outweigh policy costs. Others declined, accepting lower scores rather than implementing unwanted restrictions.

**All states** must weigh clawback risk in implementation decisions. Activities that underperform metrics or drift from approved plans create vulnerability. The uncertainty of annual re-scoring encourages conservative interpretation of approved uses and careful documentation of compliance.

## What RHTP Is and Is Not

### What RHTP Provides

**Substantial funding** for transformation activities. Even with per-capita disparities, most states receive $150-280 million annually, meaningful resources for rural health initiatives.

**Federal legitimacy** for state priorities. RHTP designation validates state rural health strategies, potentially attracting matching investments from foundations, health systems, and other partners.

**Technical assistance** and peer learning opportunities that would otherwise require state investment.

**Political cover** for difficult decisions. States can cite federal requirements when implementing unpopular policies or declining requests that fall outside approved uses.

**Timeline pressure** that forces action. The obligation deadlines prevent indefinite planning processes, requiring states to actually implement rather than perpetually prepare.

### What RHTP Does Not Provide

**Coverage expansion.** RHTP funds transformation activities, not insurance coverage. The 1.4 million Texans in the Medicaid coverage gap remain uncovered regardless of RHTP investment.

**Hospital bailouts.** Facilities on the brink of closure cannot receive operating subsidies. RHTP may fund activities that eventually improve their financial position, but not direct rescue.

**Medicaid replacement.** The $911 billion in Medicaid cuts far exceeds RHTP investment. States cannot use transformation funds to compensate for coverage and reimbursement losses.

**Guaranteed sustainability.** RHTP ends in FY2030. States must develop their own sustainability strategies. Federal funding provides a window for transformation, not permanent support.

**Formula equity.** Large rural states face structural disadvantage. Texas cannot achieve what Alaska can with equivalent effort because per-capita resources differ by a factor of six.

## Conclusion

The Rural Health Transformation Program offers $50 billion to address rural health infrastructure collapse. The investment is real and substantial. So are the constraints.

States must navigate a funding formula that advantages geography over population, application requirements that reward political alignment, spending deadlines that force rapid implementation, and sustainability expectations that require planning for federal withdrawal. **Success requires understanding these parameters, not merely having good intentions.**

Article 2B examines the Medicaid context that makes RHTP simultaneously necessary and insufficient. The $911 billion cut creates the crisis that $50 billion attempts to address. The math does not work, but states must work with what exists.

RHTP will not save rural healthcare. It may, if implemented strategically within its constraints, enable specific transformations that improve specific outcomes for specific populations. Expecting more guarantees disappointment. Expecting less wastes opportunity. Understanding the program as it actually operates allows states to accomplish what is possible.
