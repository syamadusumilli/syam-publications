# Technical Document 2-TD-B
# Federal Rural Health Program Coordination Matrix

## Document Overview

This technical document provides a **comprehensive reference for federal rural health programs** operating alongside the Rural Health Transformation Program (RHTP). The matrix enables state planners, providers, and analysts to identify program overlaps, coordinate funding streams, and understand the federal landscape that RHTP transformation must navigate.

**RHTP does not operate in isolation.** CMS, HRSA, IHS, and USDA collectively administer billions in rural health funding through programs with distinct eligibility criteria, funding mechanisms, and reporting requirements. Effective transformation requires understanding these relationships rather than treating RHTP as standalone investment.
