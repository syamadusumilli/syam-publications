# Article 2C: Medicare Rural Provisions

## The Infrastructure Beneath Transformation

*Series 2: Federal Policy Architecture*

> *"Medicare provides the financial foundation upon which rural health infrastructure either stands or collapses. RHTP transformation efforts cannot succeed if that foundation crumbles."*

## Introduction

Medicare pays the bills that keep rural hospitals open. In 2023, Medicare and Medicaid combined covered 72% of rural hospital inpatient discharges. Rural residents skew older than urban populations, which means Medicare constitutes an even larger share of the payer mix for hospitals serving these communities. When Medicare payment policies change, rural hospitals feel the effects immediately and intensely.

Congress recognized this dependence decades ago and created special payment provisions designed to preserve rural healthcare access. **Critical Access Hospitals receive cost-based reimbursement.** Sole Community Hospitals receive payment protections based on historical costs. Rural Health Clinics receive enhanced reimbursement for primary care visits. These provisions form the baseline financial architecture that RHTP transformation efforts must build upon.

Understanding Medicare rural provisions matters for two reasons. First, RHTP cannot replace Medicare. The transformation program provides one-time investments while Medicare provides ongoing operational revenue. Second, Medicare provisions are under constant political pressure. Cost-based reimbursement faces periodic challenges from budget hawks. Payment protections require congressional renewal. **The foundation that rural hospitals depend upon is not guaranteed.**

This article examines the major Medicare rural provisions, their requirements and payment structures, their limitations, and how they interact with RHTP transformation efforts.

## Critical Access Hospital Program

### Origins and Purpose

The Critical Access Hospital designation emerged from crisis. More than 400 rural hospitals closed during the 1980s and early 1990s. Small facilities could not survive under Medicare's prospective payment system, which paid fixed rates based on diagnosis rather than actual costs. Low patient volumes meant high per-patient costs that fixed payments could not cover.

Congress responded with the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, creating the CAH designation and the Medicare Rural Hospital Flexibility Program. The concept was straightforward: allow the smallest rural hospitals to receive cost-based payment instead of prospective payment, removing the financial penalty for serving small populations.

**As of April 2025, 1,377 Critical Access Hospitals operate across the United States.** They represent the majority of small rural hospitals and provide essential services to communities that would otherwise have no local healthcare access.

### Designation Requirements

To qualify as a Critical Access Hospital, a facility must meet specific criteria:

**Geographic requirements** demand isolation from other hospitals. A CAH must be located more than 35 miles from another hospital or CAH. In mountainous terrain or areas with only secondary roads, the distance requirement drops to 15 miles. Hospitals designated as "necessary providers" by their state before January 1, 2006, are exempt from distance requirements but must still be located in rural areas.

**Size limitations** cap capacity at 25 inpatient beds for acute care. CAHs may also operate distinct part rehabilitation and psychiatric units, each with up to 10 beds, that do not count against the 25-bed limit.

**Length of stay requirements** mandate an annual average acute care stay of 96 hours or less. This encourages CAHs to focus on short-term stabilization and transfer patients requiring extended care to larger facilities.

**Emergency service requirements** demand 24/7 emergency care capability using on-site or on-call staff. Specific response time requirements apply depending on staffing models.

**State participation** requires that the hospital be located in a state with an established Medicare Rural Hospital Flexibility Program and state rural health plan. Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, and Rhode Island have not established Flex programs and therefore have no CAHs.

### Cost-Based Reimbursement

The defining benefit of CAH status is cost-based reimbursement at **101% of allowable costs** for inpatient, outpatient, and swing-bed services. This sounds simple but involves considerable complexity.

**Cost-based payment is not cost-plus payment.** The common misconception that Medicare simply reimburses whatever costs a CAH incurs is false. Medicare pays 101% of "reasonable and allowable costs" as determined through cost report settlement. Not all services qualify. Not all costs are deemed reasonable. The gap between actual costs and reimbursable costs can be substantial.

**Sequestration reduces effective payment.** Federal budget sequestration, in effect since 2013, reduces CAH reimbursement by 2%, bringing effective payment to approximately 99% of allowable costs rather than 101%.

**Coinsurance burdens fall on patients.** Medicare beneficiaries pay coinsurance based on hospital charges, not costs. Because CAH charges often exceed costs significantly, beneficiaries can end up paying 40-60% of actual costs rather than the standard 20%. This creates financial barriers for the very populations CAHs serve.

**Bad debt accumulates.** When patients cannot pay their coinsurance, CAHs experience bad debt losses. Medicare reimburses only 65% of bad debt on Medicare patients. Higher coinsurance amounts generate higher bad debt exposure.

### Financial Reality

CAH status does not guarantee financial viability. The Flex Monitoring Team's 2024 analysis showed total margins for rural CAHs ranging from negative 20.5% to positive 28.0%. One-third of rural hospital closures over the past decade involved Critical Access Hospitals.

**Cost-based payment helps but cannot solve fundamental viability problems.** CAHs still lose money on non-Medicare patients. Commercial insurers and Medicaid do not provide cost-based reimbursement except in certain states with favorable Medicaid policies. Hospitals with high Medicare shares benefit most from CAH status; those with diverse payer mixes may see less advantage.

**Low volumes remain problematic.** Cost-based payment covers Medicare costs but cannot generate sufficient revenue when total patient volume is inadequate. Fixed costs must be spread across whatever volume exists. A CAH with declining admissions faces rising per-patient costs even with cost-based reimbursement.

### Swing Bed Services

CAHs can use swing beds to transition patients between acute care and skilled nursing care without physical transfer. This flexibility allows small hospitals to serve multiple functions with limited bed capacity.

**Swing bed payment follows CAH cost-based methodology** rather than the Skilled Nursing Facility Prospective Payment System that applies to other providers. The HHS Office of Inspector General has repeatedly recommended aligning CAH swing bed payments with SNF PPS rates, estimating potential Medicare savings of $7.7 billion over six years. CMS has not concurred with these recommendations, recognizing that rural access concerns outweigh cost savings.

### Quality Reporting

CAHs participate in the Medicare Beneficiary Quality Improvement Project through the Flex Program. MBQIP reporting includes measures on patient experience, healthcare-associated infections, and other quality indicators. Unlike larger hospitals, CAHs are not subject to value-based purchasing penalties based on quality performance, though quality reporting requirements apply.

## Rural Emergency Hospital Program

### A New Provider Type

The Rural Emergency Hospital designation, created by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 and effective January 1, 2023, represents the first new rural provider type since CAHs in 1997. REHs address a specific problem: what happens when a rural hospital cannot sustain inpatient services but the community still needs emergency and outpatient care.

**As of October 2025, 42 facilities have converted to REH status.** Uptake has been slower than some expected, with 19 conversions in 2023, 18 in 2024, and 5 in 2025. Over 1,500 hospitals were initially eligible for the designation.

### Conversion Requirements

To convert to an REH, a facility must have been enrolled and certified as a Medicare-participating hospital on December 27, 2020, operating either as a CAH or a rural PPS hospital with 50 or fewer beds. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act expanded eligibility to include hospitals that operated between January 1, 2014, and December 26, 2020, but subsequently closed.

**REHs cannot provide inpatient services** except for post-hospital extended care in a distinct part unit licensed as a skilled nursing facility. They must provide 24/7 emergency services and may provide observation care up to 24 hours and other outpatient services.

**State licensure is required.** Because REH is a new provider type, states must establish specific licensing requirements. The National Conference of State Legislatures tracks state legislative actions on REH licensure.

### Payment Structure

REH payment includes two components that together create a more predictable revenue stream than volume-dependent traditional hospital payment.

**Outpatient services receive 105% of Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System rates.** This 5% premium compensates for rural cost differentials and provides incentive for conversion.

**Monthly facility payments provide baseline revenue regardless of volume.** For 2025, each REH receives $285,625.90 per month, totaling approximately $3.4 million annually. This payment increases annually by the hospital market basket percentage. The facility payment is uniform across all REHs regardless of size, location, or service volume.

### Conversion Barriers

Despite financial incentives, REH conversion faces significant barriers.

**Community resistance to losing inpatient services** creates political obstacles. Local residents and elected officials often view hospital conversion as failure rather than strategic adaptation. The perception of "losing the hospital" can override rational analysis of sustainability.

**Loss of swing beds** eliminates an important revenue stream and service capability. Facilities that derive significant revenue from skilled nursing services in swing beds may find conversion financially disadvantageous.

**340B program revenue loss** affects many converting hospitals. CAHs participating in the 340B Drug Pricing Program may lose that status upon REH conversion, eliminating pharmacy revenue that supported other operations.

**Financial modeling uncertainty** makes conversion decisions difficult. The REH designation is new enough that long-term financial performance data does not exist. Hospitals considering conversion must rely on projections rather than demonstrated outcomes.

### Early Observations

Analysis of first-year REH conversions by the Rural Healthcare Initiative revealed several patterns:

**Non-expansion state concentration.** Twenty percent of U.S. states have not expanded Medicaid, but these states account for approximately 66% of REH conversions. This suggests hospitals in non-expansion states face greater financial pressure requiring the REH lifeline.

**Sole Community Hospital vulnerability.** Despite CAHs outnumbering SCHs by 3-to-1, more SCHs than CAHs converted to REH status in the first year. The older SCH designation may provide less financial protection in the current environment.

**Independent hospital predominance.** Most converting hospitals were independent rather than system-affiliated. Systems can cross-subsidize struggling facilities while independents must be self-sustaining.

**Declining volumes preceded conversion.** Hospitals converting to REH status typically showed declining inpatient volumes before conversion, suggesting the designation captures facilities already losing inpatient viability.

## Sole Community Hospitals and Medicare Dependent Hospitals

### Protecting Essential Access

Sole Community Hospitals and Medicare Dependent Hospitals operate under the Inpatient Prospective Payment System but receive enhanced payments to address rural financial pressures. These programs recognize that standard PPS rates may be inadequate for hospitals with specific characteristics.

### Sole Community Hospital Program

**SCH designation applies to hospitals that are geographically isolated** and serve as the sole source of inpatient services reasonably available to Medicare beneficiaries in their area. Requirements include location more than 35 miles from other like hospitals, or location in a rural area with 25-35 miles distance and demonstration that no more than 25% of residents seeking hospital care go elsewhere, or location in a rural area with other qualifying circumstances including weather, travel conditions, and terrain.

**SCHs receive payment protections** based on a historical cost baseline. Medicare pays the higher of the federal PPS rate or a hospital-specific rate derived from historical costs. This floor protects against PPS rates that would be inadequate for the hospital's cost structure.

**SCHs can request volume decrease adjustments** when circumstances beyond their control cause discharge declines exceeding 5%. This provision prevents catastrophic financial consequences from short-term volume disruptions.

### Medicare Dependent Hospital Program

**MDH designation applies to small rural hospitals heavily dependent on Medicare revenue.** Requirements include location in a rural area, no more than 100 beds, at least 60% of inpatient days or discharges attributable to Medicare beneficiaries, and not classified as a Sole Community Hospital.

**MDH payment provides enhanced reimbursement** for Medicare inpatient services, with hospitals receiving 75% of the difference between the federal rate and their hospital-specific rate (calculated based on historical costs).

### Expiration Risk

**MDH enhanced payments and low-volume hospital adjustments face expiration on September 30, 2025.** Congress has repeatedly extended these programs, but each renewal requires legislative action. The Rural Hospital Support Act and Assistance for Rural Community Hospitals Act would permanently extend these provisions, but passage is not guaranteed.

If extensions do not occur, CMS estimates affected hospitals would lose approximately $500 million in annual payments. For individual MDH facilities, this could represent the difference between viability and closure.

## Rural Health Clinic Program

### Primary Care Access

Rural Health Clinics provide primary care services in rural areas designated as medically underserved or Health Professional Shortage Areas. **More than 5,700 RHCs operate across the United States as of October 2025.** They serve as the primary care backbone for many rural communities that lack physician practices.

### Certification Requirements

RHC certification requires:

**Rural location** in an area designated as rural by the Office of Management and Budget based on Core Based Statistical Area definitions.

**HPSA or MUA designation** confirming shortage of health professionals or medical services in the area.

**Mid-level practitioner staffing** with at least one nurse practitioner or physician assistant on site at least 50% of operating hours.

### Payment Structure

**Medicare pays RHCs through an All-Inclusive Rate** that bundles payment for a covered visit regardless of the specific services provided during that visit. Multiple medically necessary visits on the same day generally count as a single visit for payment purposes, with limited exceptions.

**For 2025, the AIR payment limit is $152 per visit** for independent RHCs and provider-based RHCs in hospitals with 50 or more beds. Certain provider-based RHCs with AIR rates established before April 2021 may receive higher payments based on their historical cost-based rates.

**The CY 2025 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule Final Rule** made several significant changes to RHC payment policy, including elimination of productivity standards, revised care management billing codes, new Advanced Primary Care Management Services opportunities, and changes to vaccine reimbursement timing.

### Provider-Based vs. Independent

RHCs may be independent (freestanding) or provider-based (operated as part of a hospital, skilled nursing facility, or home health agency). **Provider-based RHCs in hospitals with 50 or more beds face the same AIR payment limits as independent RHCs.** Provider-based RHCs in smaller hospitals may receive higher rates if their historical costs exceeded current limits.

This distinction matters for RHTP planning. Hospitals considering RHC development must understand the payment implications of different organizational structures.

## Medicare Advantage in Rural Areas

### Growing Penetration

**Medicare Advantage enrollment in rural areas grew from 400,000 beneficiaries in 2010 to more than 1.8 million in 2023**, a fourfold increase. MA plans now enroll a majority of all Medicare beneficiaries nationally, though rural penetration rates remain lower than urban.

This growth has profound implications for rural hospitals that depend on Medicare cost-based and enhanced payments. MA plans are not required to pay cost-based rates. They negotiate reimbursement like commercial payers, eliminating the financial protections that Medicare fee-for-service provides.

### Payment Challenges

**MA plans reimburse rural providers an average of 10% less than traditional Medicare relative to costs**, according to a February 2025 AHA report. Rural hospitals with special designations fare worse: Medicare Dependent Hospitals and Low-Volume Hospitals receive 15% less from MA plans than from traditional Medicare.

**Even Critical Access Hospitals experience MA payment shortfalls.** Industry benchmark data from Strata Decision Technology shows MA plans paying CAHs only 95% of traditional Medicare rates. This effectively undermines the cost-based reimbursement that justifies CAH status.

Limited competition among MA plans in rural markets weakens hospital bargaining power. Rural areas may have only one or two MA plan options, giving plans leverage in rate negotiations that urban hospitals with more plan competition do not face.

### Operational Burdens

MA plans impose administrative requirements that strain rural hospital resources.

**Prior authorization requirements** delay care and require staff time to process. Nearly four in five rural clinicians report significant increases in prior authorization burdens over the past five years, with 86% reporting negative impacts on care delivery.

**Discharge delays** occur when MA plans dispute coverage or lack adequate post-acute care networks. MA patients stay nearly 10% longer in rural hospitals than clinically similar traditional Medicare patients before discharge to post-acute settings.

**Network adequacy gaps** create access barriers. Rural areas may lack sufficient MA network providers, forcing beneficiaries to travel long distances or seek out-of-network care.

### Policy Implications

The Bipartisan Policy Center and other analysts have called for reforms ensuring MA plans pay rural hospitals at rates adequate to sustain access. Proposals include requiring MA plans to pay cost-based rates to CAHs, establishing minimum payment floors for rural hospitals, and improving network adequacy requirements in rural areas.

**For RHTP planning purposes, states must account for MA penetration** when projecting hospital financial performance. Transformation investments in facilities heavily exposed to MA payment shortfalls may produce limited returns if underlying payment inadequacy persists.

## Telehealth and Rural Medicare

### COVID-Era Flexibilities

The COVID-19 public health emergency produced rapid expansion of Medicare telehealth coverage, eliminating geographic restrictions, waiving originating site requirements, and allowing audio-only services for certain conditions. These flexibilities proved particularly valuable for rural beneficiaries facing distance and transportation barriers.

**Temporary provisions require congressional reauthorization.** Without legislative action, many telehealth flexibilities will expire on December 31, 2025. RHCs and FQHCs can continue billing for telehealth services through that date under existing temporary authority.

### Permanent Rural Provisions

Certain telehealth provisions specific to rural areas are permanent or have longer authorizations:

**CAHs may serve as telehealth originating sites**, receiving facility fees for hosting telehealth encounters. This creates revenue opportunities when patients receive specialist consultations via telehealth at their local CAH.

**Mental health telehealth** received expanded permanent coverage under the CY 2022 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule, allowing FQHCs and RHCs to bill for behavioral health visits using audio-visual and, in some cases, audio-only technology.

**Rural-specific originating site rules** allow services to be furnished at specified rural originating sites without the geographic restrictions that apply to urban telehealth.

### RHTP Telehealth Investments

RHTP explicitly authorizes telehealth infrastructure investments as approved uses of transformation funds. States may invest in equipment and connectivity for rural providers and patients, training and technical assistance for telehealth adoption, technology platforms for virtual care delivery, and consumer-facing applications for chronic disease management.

**These investments depend on continued Medicare coverage** of telehealth services. RHTP can fund infrastructure, but providers need ongoing reimbursement to sustain telehealth operations. Congressional failure to extend telehealth flexibilities would undermine transformation investments in this area.

## RHTP Interaction with Medicare Provisions

### Building on the Foundation

RHTP transformation activities operate on top of the Medicare foundation. The program cannot replace ongoing Medicare operational revenue. It provides one-time investments to strengthen infrastructure that Medicare payments must subsequently sustain.

**Successful RHTP implementation requires understanding how transformation investments interact with Medicare payment.** A few examples:

**Workforce investments** may increase hospital costs. If those costs are allowable under CAH cost-based methodology, Medicare will cover the increase. If not (because the service is not covered, or the cost is deemed unreasonable), the hospital absorbs the cost.

**Telehealth infrastructure** generates revenue only if Medicare covers telehealth services at rates adequate to sustain operations. RHTP can fund equipment; Medicare determines whether using that equipment pays.

**Care coordination improvements** may reduce hospitalizations. Under value-based arrangements, this benefits providers. Under fee-for-service, reduced volume means reduced revenue, potentially undermining the financial case for transformation.

### Designation Strategy

States and hospitals should consider Medicare designation strategy as part of RHTP planning:

**CAH conversion** may benefit PPS hospitals struggling with low volumes and high Medicare shares. The cost-based reimbursement may provide more stable revenue than volume-dependent PPS payment.

**REH conversion** may suit facilities that cannot sustain inpatient services. The monthly facility payment provides baseline revenue regardless of volume, while 105% OPPS payment supports outpatient operations.

**Maintaining existing designations** may be optimal for hospitals where current provisions provide adequate support. Change for its own sake offers no benefit.

### Payment Adequacy Assumptions

RHTP applications and state plans typically assume continued Medicare payment at current levels. **This assumption may not hold.** Per capita cap implementation, MA payment shortfalls, sequestration, and potential changes to cost-based reimbursement could all reduce Medicare revenue below projected levels.

States should consider sensitivity analysis examining how RHTP transformation strategies perform under various Medicare payment scenarios. Plans that depend on continued cost-based reimbursement are vulnerable to policy changes that eliminate or modify that protection.

## The External View

### MedPAC Scrutiny

The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission periodically examines rural payment provisions. MedPAC has questioned whether cost-based reimbursement remains appropriate for all CAHs, particularly those near other hospitals or in areas with declining access concerns.

**Proposals to reform CAH payment** have included limiting cost-based reimbursement to truly isolated facilities, aligning swing bed payment with SNF PPS rates, and restructuring the CAH program based on community need rather than historical designation.

Rural hospital advocates vigorously oppose these proposals, arguing that reduced payment would accelerate closures. The political reality is that rural constituencies have sufficient representation to protect existing provisions, though not necessarily to expand them.

### Access vs. Efficiency Debates

Policy debates over rural Medicare provisions reflect fundamental tension between access and efficiency goals.

**Access arguments** hold that rural populations deserve healthcare access regardless of cost. Cost-based reimbursement exists because standard payment mechanisms cannot sustain rural infrastructure. Cutting payments would eliminate services that cannot be replaced.

**Efficiency arguments** hold that Medicare should not overpay for services available at lower cost elsewhere. If beneficiaries can reasonably access care at non-CAH facilities, paying CAH rates represents waste. Resources directed to small facilities might produce more health benefit if redirected to larger regional facilities or alternative service models.

**RHTP attempts to bridge this tension** by funding transformation toward sustainable models that reduce dependence on enhanced payment provisions. The program's emphasis on right-sizing healthcare delivery systems reflects recognition that maintaining current infrastructure indefinitely may not be possible or desirable.

## Politics and Policy

### Congressional Dynamics

Rural payment provisions enjoy bipartisan support rooted in geographic representation. Rural states and districts span both parties, creating coalitions that can protect rural healthcare funding even when overall Medicare spending faces pressure.

**Extension battles recur regularly.** MDH and low-volume hospital provisions require periodic renewal. Each expiration creates legislative urgency that advocates leverage to secure extensions, but also creates uncertainty that complicates long-term planning.

**Reform proposals typically fail** when they threaten rural access. Even proposals that would improve efficiency face opposition from hospitals, communities, and elected officials who prioritize maintaining existing facilities.

### MAHA Alignment

The current administration's Make America Healthy Again priorities emphasize prevention and wellness over treatment. **How this philosophy applies to Medicare rural provisions remains unclear.** MAHA rhetoric focuses on reducing chronic disease, which could theoretically reduce need for hospital services. But rural populations currently have higher chronic disease burdens, suggesting near-term hospital demand will persist even if prevention efforts eventually succeed.

### Sequestration Politics

**Budget sequestration continues reducing Medicare payments across the board**, including the 2% reduction to CAH cost-based reimbursement. Sequestration relief has been proposed but faces budgetary offset requirements. Rural advocates continue seeking sequestration exemptions for rural providers, with limited success.

## Conclusion

Medicare rural provisions create the financial foundation that RHTP transformation must build upon. Critical Access Hospitals receive cost-based reimbursement that protects against volume volatility. Rural Emergency Hospitals offer a conversion pathway for facilities that cannot sustain inpatient services. Sole Community Hospitals and Medicare Dependent Hospitals receive enhanced PPS payment. Rural Health Clinics receive bundled payment for primary care visits.

**These provisions are not permanent, not adequate for all circumstances, and not immune to policy change.** RHTP planners must understand how transformation investments interact with Medicare payment structures and how those structures might change during the five-year RHTP window and beyond.

The growth of Medicare Advantage complicates rural hospital finance by introducing negotiated payment that may fall below fee-for-service equivalents. Telehealth provisions that expanded during COVID face uncertain futures absent congressional action to make them permanent.

Article 2D examines HRSA rural programs, including the National Health Service Corps, Community Health Center program, and other workforce and access initiatives that complement Medicare payment provisions in supporting rural health infrastructure.
