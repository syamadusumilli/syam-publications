## Being Helped vs. Being Fixed

The consultant from Louisville arrived in Letcher County with PowerPoint slides describing **"barriers to healthcare transformation."** The slides used words like "resistant," "noncompliant," and "hard to reach." They documented deficits: low education levels, high rates of chronic disease, limited broadband access, distrust of institutions. The presentation concluded with recommendations for "culturally competent interventions" to overcome community resistance.

Helen Caudill had lived in Letcher County her entire seventy-three years. She raised four children there, buried her husband there, cared for her mother there until dementia claimed her. She had spent forty years as a community health worker, the term they eventually learned to call what she had always done: helping her neighbors navigate systems designed without them in mind.

She sat in the back of the community meeting where the consultant presented. She heard her community described as a problem. She heard solutions designed by people who had never lived where she lived, who analyzed her neighbors as data points, who mistook unfamiliarity for expertise.

**"They come to fix us,"** she told her daughter afterward. **"They do not come to help us. They come to make us more like them, because the way we are is wrong in their eyes."**

Her distinction, between being fixed and being helped, captures what dignity means in healthcare transformation. Help honors the person being helped. It asks what they need, respects their judgment, expands their options, preserves their agency. Fixing treats people as problems. It diagnoses deficits, prescribes solutions, measures compliance, judges success by whether the fixed person now resembles what fixers intended.

Rural health transformation operates predominantly in the fixing mode. This article examines what that costs.

## The Phenomenon

**Deficit framing** pervades how external institutions perceive and describe rural communities. Grant applications document needs and problems to justify funding. Research studies measure disparities and gaps to demonstrate the case for intervention. Policy briefs compile statistics on what rural America lacks: fewer physicians, higher mortality, lower income, less education, more chronic disease.

This framing is not false. The disparities exist. The needs are real. But deficit documentation shapes what solutions look like. When a community is defined by its problems, interventions target those problems. **The community becomes the object of intervention** rather than a participant in determining what intervention should look like.

The framing also affects how communities see themselves. Decades of being described as deficient, backward, left behind, in decline produces internalized narratives that constrain imagination. If young people absorb that their communities have no future, they leave. If remaining residents absorb that they are problems awaiting solution, they may accept solutions that do not serve them or reject engagement entirely.

**Expert imposition** flows from deficit framing. Problems identified by external analysis require solutions developed through external expertise. The logic is straightforward: communities have problems, experts have knowledge, expert knowledge should be applied to community problems.

The pattern appears throughout transformation. State agencies design programs based on evidence from research conducted elsewhere. Technical assistance providers from national organizations advise on implementation strategies developed for different contexts. Consultants with credentials but no local knowledge prescribe practices that worked in settings unlike the ones where they now recommend them.

**"Evidence-based"** has become a term that often means "developed and tested elsewhere." The evidence base for rural health interventions is thin, with most research conducted in urban or suburban settings. Applying findings from those settings to rural contexts assumes transferability that may not exist. **What worked in Cleveland may not work in Harlan**, not because Harlan resists evidence but because the contexts differ in ways the evidence did not examine.

**Outcome attribution** compounds the dignity problem. When transformation efforts succeed, success is credited to the program, the intervention, the external expertise that guided implementation. When transformation efforts fail, failure is attributed to the community: they were resistant, noncompliant, not ready to change, lacking capacity, unwilling to engage.

This attribution pattern appears explicitly in program evaluations and implicitly in how transformation is discussed. Communities become responsible for implementing programs designed without their input, then bear blame when programs do not achieve outcomes determined by external metrics. **Agency in design flows to experts; accountability for outcomes flows to communities.**

**Paternalism** operates through assumptions about what communities need that may not align with what communities want. The assumption that healthcare transformation should prioritize clinical quality metrics presumes that communities share that priority. The assumption that workforce development should emphasize credentialing presumes that communities value credentials over relationships. The assumption that technology deployment improves care presumes that communities experience technology as improvement.

Paternalism does not require malice or condescension. Well-intentioned actors genuinely believe they know what communities need and act accordingly. **The problem is not bad faith but the presumption** that external knowledge supersedes local knowledge about local conditions and local values.

## The Core Tension: Being Helped vs. Being Fixed

Help and fixing share surface resemblance but differ fundamentally in how they position the person receiving assistance.

**Help preserves dignity** by treating the helped person as capable, as possessing judgment worthy of respect, as knowing their own circumstances better than helpers can know them from outside. Help asks what is needed. It offers resources and options. It respects refusal and supports choice. The helper positions themselves as serving the helped person's purposes, not their own.

**Fixing diminishes dignity** by treating the fixed person as deficient, as lacking judgment or capacity, as needing correction by someone who knows better. Fixing diagnoses problems. It prescribes solutions. It measures compliance. It judges success by whether the fixed person now meets the fixer's standards. The fixer positions themselves as superior to the person being fixed.

Much of healthcare operates in fixing mode. Medical training emphasizes diagnosis and treatment. Patients present with problems; clinicians identify causes and prescribe interventions. The framework places clinical expertise above patient experience by design. **Clinical knowledge matters** because clinicians know things patients do not.

But the fixing frame extends beyond clinical knowledge into domains where expertise claims are weaker. When transformation programs presume to know how communities should be organized, what values communities should hold, how people should relate to their health, they claim expertise that their credentials do not support.

**Helen Caudill's distinction matters** because rural communities experience transformation through this lens. The consultant who presents slides describing community deficits may believe they are providing helpful analysis. The community receiving that analysis hears: you are deficient and we will fix you.

The same information, framed differently, produces different experience. "Your community faces challenges that outside resources might help address, if you want them" positions the community as agent. "Your community has barriers to health that our intervention will overcome" positions the community as object.

## Vignette: What Partnership Requires

The first meeting between the rural health transformation planning committee and community members in Carroll County, Kentucky went poorly. The planning committee, composed of state agency staff, hospital administrators, and technical assistance consultants, presented a draft plan developed over months without community input. The plan was evidence-based, aligned with RHTP priorities, and responsive to regional health data showing elevated rates of chronic disease and behavioral health needs.

Rita Begley, who had organized community health events in Carroll County for fifteen years, asked why the community was learning about the plan at a presentation rather than helping develop it. The planning committee chair explained that community engagement was happening now, at this meeting, where feedback was welcome.

**"Feedback on your plan is not the same as involvement in making a plan,"** Begley said. **"You have already decided what we need. Now you want us to say we agree."**

The tension that followed reflected competing views of community engagement. The planning committee believed they had engaged appropriately: they analyzed data, reviewed evidence, developed a plan designed to address identified needs, and brought that plan to the community for response. Community members believed engagement required something different: being present when needs were identified, when options were considered, when trade-offs were weighed.

The planning committee had expertise. They knew RHTP requirements, understood evidence on effective interventions, and possessed technical capacity to develop fundable applications. Community members had different expertise: knowledge of their own circumstances, understanding of local dynamics, awareness of what previous interventions had attempted and why they failed or succeeded.

**Neither expertise was sufficient alone.** The planning committee's plan reflected evidence from elsewhere applied to a community they did not know. Community members' objections reflected experience that shaped receptivity to external intervention. Effective transformation required both, but the process had prioritized one over the other.

Six months later, a reconstituted planning process produced different results. Community members participated from the beginning, identifying what they saw as priority concerns (transportation, behavioral health, prescription costs) that differed somewhat from what data analysis had highlighted. Technical experts contributed knowledge about what interventions had evidence, what funding would support, what implementation required. **The resulting plan reflected both perspectives**, imperfectly merged but genuinely collaborative.

Rita Begley chaired the community advisory committee for the revised plan. She acknowledged that the plan was not what she would have designed alone, just as it was not what the state agency would have designed alone. **"But it is ours,"** she said. **"We made it together. When it works, we did that. When it struggles, we have to fix it together. That is different from being handed something and told to make it succeed."**

The difference she described was ownership, which is another word for agency. Plans developed through partnership belong to those who developed them. Plans developed elsewhere and delivered to communities belong to whoever developed them, regardless of who must implement them.

## Asset-Based Alternatives

**Asset-based community development** emerged as explicit alternative to deficit-based approaches. Rather than beginning with what communities lack, asset-based approaches begin with what communities have: skills, relationships, institutions, knowledge, resources that can be mobilized for community purposes.

The framework originated in community development and has influenced public health practice. **Asset-based public health** identifies community strengths that promote health, builds on those strengths, and engages communities as partners in health improvement rather than targets of intervention.

Research examining asset-based approaches identifies several principles that distinguish them from deficit approaches:

**Community members drive the process.** Rather than external experts determining priorities, community members identify what matters to them and what resources they can contribute. Technical expertise supports community priorities rather than supplanting them.

**Strengths precede needs.** Assessment begins with what exists and works, not with what is absent and broken. Problems are addressed through mobilizing existing assets rather than importing external solutions.

**Relationships matter more than services.** Connection between community members builds capacity that services cannot provide. Creating relationships produces outcomes that service delivery alone does not.

**Change comes from within.** Sustainable transformation requires community ownership that external intervention cannot create. Programs that build community capacity leave lasting change; programs that deliver services leave dependency.

The evidence on asset-based approaches in health remains limited, in part because asset-based approaches resist the standardization that conventional evaluation requires. Studies suggest that community engagement in health program design improves outcomes, that programs involving community members as partners outperform programs treating communities as recipients, and that asset-based framing affects community self-perception in ways that influence health behaviors.

**But asset-based approaches face practical constraints** that honest assessment must acknowledge. Funders typically require deficit documentation to justify investment. Grant applications must demonstrate need, and need is documented through problems. Asset-based framing struggles to meet funder expectations designed for deficit-based logic.

Asset-based approaches also take time that transformation timelines may not allow. Building relationships, identifying assets, developing community-driven priorities requires extended engagement. Programs facing implementation deadlines may not have time for processes that asset-based approaches require.

## Alternative Perspectives

Several alternative perspectives challenge the primacy of dignity and agency concerns.

**The deficit reality view** holds that **problems are real and must be named.** Rural health disparities exist. Mortality rates are elevated. Provider shortages persist. Pretending these problems do not exist or minimizing them to avoid deficit framing abandons communities that need intervention. Effective transformation requires honest acknowledgment of what is wrong.

**The expertise necessity view** holds that **expert knowledge is necessary for effective programs.** Communities may not know what interventions have evidence supporting them. They may not understand healthcare financing, workforce policy, or regulatory requirements. Technical expertise enables programs that work; communities lack capacity to design effective interventions alone.

**The outcomes priority view** holds that **results matter more than process.** If an externally designed program improves health outcomes, the fact that communities did not design it matters less than the improvement achieved. Dignity concerns become obstacles if they prevent effective intervention from reaching populations that need help.

**The capacity limitation view** holds that **communities often lack capacity** that asset-based approaches assume. Small rural communities may not have the organizational infrastructure, leadership depth, or civic engagement necessary to drive transformation processes. Waiting for community capacity may mean waiting indefinitely while health worsens.

Each perspective contains truth that the dignity frame must accommodate.

**Deficits are real.** The critique of deficit framing is not that problems do not exist but that defining communities by their problems shapes intervention in ways that may undermine effectiveness. Acknowledging problems while recognizing strengths represents integration, not contradiction.

**Expertise matters.** Technical knowledge about effective interventions, funding requirements, and implementation science contributes to transformation success. The critique is not that expertise has no value but that expertise in healthcare does not extend to knowing communities better than communities know themselves.

**Outcomes deserve emphasis.** Transformation that does not improve health fails regardless of process quality. The critique is that outcomes achieved through dignity-eroding processes may create different problems, including community disengagement that undermines sustainability.

**Capacity varies.** Asset-based approaches assume capacity that some communities may lack. The question is whether external intervention builds capacity or substitutes for it, leaving communities no more capable after intervention than before.

## RHTP and Dignity

RHTP structure creates both opportunities and constraints for dignity-preserving transformation.

**Community engagement requirements** in RHTP applications mandate stakeholder involvement in planning. States must demonstrate community input, advisory structures, and engagement mechanisms. These requirements create space for community voice that might otherwise be absent.

But requirements are interpreted minimally when time and capacity are short. **"Community engagement" often means** a single meeting to present completed plans, an advisory committee that meets quarterly to receive updates, a survey distributed and summarized without affecting program design. The requirements establish floors that become ceilings.

**Performance metrics** embedded in RHTP emphasize outcomes that federal priorities identify. States must track clinical quality measures, healthcare utilization, population health indicators. These metrics matter, but communities may prioritize different outcomes: access without travel, trusted relationships, providers who stay.

Metric focus can override community priorities. When success is measured by federal definitions, community definitions of success become secondary. **Programs optimize for measurement** rather than for what communities would choose if choosing.

**Technical assistance** provided to states typically emphasizes implementation strategies developed through national or regional expertise. Consultants bring knowledge from elsewhere, which can inform local implementation but can also override local knowledge with standardized approaches.

The dignity question is not whether RHTP helps. Investment in rural health infrastructure, workforce, and services provides genuine benefit. The question is whether the help preserves or diminishes dignity: whether communities emerge from transformation as **agents who shaped their own improvement** or as objects who received intervention designed elsewhere.

## Honest Assessment

The being-helped-versus-being-fixed distinction clarifies what dignity-preserving transformation requires without resolving the practical tensions that constrain implementation.

**Transformation at scale creates tension with community-specific approaches.** RHTP operates across fifty states and thousands of communities. Scalable approaches necessarily standardize in ways that may not fit specific communities. The alternative, fully individualized transformation for each community, exceeds implementation capacity and funding structures.

**Timelines create tension with relationship-building.** Trust develops over years. RHTP implementation occurs over months. The relationships that would enable dignity-preserving engagement may not exist when engagement must occur.

**Expertise claims create tension with community knowledge.** Technical experts know things communities do not. Communities know things experts do not. Integrating both requires processes that take time neither experts nor communities may have.

**Accountability structures create tension with local control.** Federal funding requires federal accountability. State administration requires state authority. Local control within federally funded, state-administered programs operates within constraints that limit how much control is actually local.

The honest assessment is that **RHTP will feel like fixing to many communities** regardless of how individual programs approach community engagement. The structure, with federal priorities flowing through state administration to community implementation, positions communities as recipients rather than originators.

What individual programs can do is **mitigate the fixing experience** while operating within structural constraints. Genuine engagement that begins before plans are completed. Community members in decision-making roles, not just advisory ones. Metrics that include what communities define as success alongside what federal requirements mandate. Technical assistance that asks questions before offering answers. Implementation flexibility that allows communities to adapt approaches to local conditions.

These mitigations do not transform fixing into helping. They reduce the dignity cost of fixing while structural conditions persist.

Helen Caudill, watching transformation unfold in Letcher County, distinguishes programs that try from programs that do not. **"Some of them ask questions,"** she says. **"They want to know what we think, what we have tried, what we know about our own people. Others come with answers already decided. Both call it community engagement, but we know the difference."**

The difference she identifies is not structural. Both programs operate within the same RHTP framework, face the same timelines, respond to the same federal requirements. The difference is orientation: whether implementers see themselves as bringing solutions to deficient communities or supporting communities in addressing challenges communities identify.

That orientation difference does not resolve structural tensions. But it affects experience. **Communities know when they are being helped versus being fixed.** The distinction may not appear in program evaluations or federal reports, but it shapes whether transformation feels like partnership or colonization, whether communities engage or withdraw, whether whatever is built will last beyond the funding that created it.

## Conclusion

Dignity and agency matter for transformation not because they are pleasant but because they affect effectiveness. Communities treated as deficient disengage. Communities whose knowledge is dismissed do not share it. Communities positioned as objects resist rather than participate.

The alternative view that outcomes matter more than process misses that **process affects outcomes.** Transformation that alienates communities cannot sustain. Programs developed without community ownership fail when external support ends. Implementation that erodes dignity produces compliance at best, resistance at worst, and sustainability never.

RHTP cannot resolve the structural tensions between federal accountability and local control, between scalable approaches and community-specific needs, between expert knowledge and local knowledge. What RHTP implementation can do is attend to dignity within constraints: engage communities genuinely, recognize assets alongside deficits, position communities as partners rather than recipients, measure success partly by community definitions, and approach transformation as helping rather than fixing.

The distinction Helen Caudill made, between being helped and being fixed, will determine how rural communities experience transformation. The experience will shape whether transformation succeeds.
