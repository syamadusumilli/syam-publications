## What Systems Ask of Those Who Can Give the Least

Healthcare systems are designed by people who have never worried about whether they could afford the gas to drive to an appointment. They assume cars that run reliably, schedules that flex around medical needs, broadband that supports patient portals, and health literacy that decodes insurance notices. For rural Americans, navigating these systems is not merely inconvenient. It is a **second job layered on top of being sick**, one that extracts time, money, and cognitive energy from people who often have the least of all three.

This article examines what it actually costs rural patients to use healthcare systems built around urban assumptions. The central argument is that what institutions call "patient-centered care" often coexists with patient-hostile design, and that burden is not equally distributed. Those with the fewest resources bear the heaviest load, with predictable consequences for whether treatment is sought, initiated, and completed.

## Vignette: The Appointment That Costs a Day

David Carver's appointment is at 2:15 p.m., which means he has to leave by 11:30 to arrive on time. The specialist is in a city 73 miles away, the only cardiologist within reasonable distance who accepts his insurance. His truck gets fourteen miles to the gallon. At current gas prices, the round trip will cost him about forty dollars.

He cannot take the whole day off work. The fabrication shop where he's worked for twenty-two years does not offer sick leave, and he already used his vacation days for his wife's surgery in October. So he worked the early shift starting at 5 a.m., arranged to clock out at 11, and will lose about six hours of pay. That is another ninety dollars he will not see in his check.

His daughter was going to drive him, but her shift at the nursing home could not be covered. His brother offered, but his brother has a CDL and cannot risk being late for his afternoon haul. So David drives himself, which the cardiologist's office discouraged because of the new medication that sometimes makes him dizzy. He drives anyway. There is no one else.

The appointment itself takes eighteen minutes. The cardiologist is running behind, so David sits in the waiting room for an hour and twenty minutes, which is actually short by recent standards. The doctor adjusts his medication, orders a test that will require another trip, and tells him to schedule a follow-up in six weeks. The front desk person hands him a paper referral for the test and a number to call to schedule it. She does not know which facilities accept his insurance. He will have to figure that out himself.

He gets home at 6:40 p.m., having eaten nothing since the banana he grabbed at 4:45 that morning. The whole day, by his calculation, cost him about $180 between gas, lost wages, and the copay. Plus the day itself, which you cannot put a price on but which he needed for other things.

His wife asks how it went. "Fine," he says. "They want me back in six weeks."

She does not ask whether he will go. They both know the answer depends on whether they can afford it.

## The Phenomenon

The burden of accessing healthcare falls unevenly across the American population, with rural residents experiencing systematically higher costs in time, money, and effort. Research consistently documents that **rural patients report more problems with transportation and travel distance** and carry a higher burden of travel when measured by both distance and time traveled.

Distance burden is the most visible dimension. The average rural resident lives further from primary care, far further from specialists, and often prohibitively far from tertiary services. A scoping review of 135 studies from developed countries found consistent evidence of "distance decay," meaning that healthcare utilization declines as distance to services increases. This pattern holds regardless of how distance is measured, though time traveled may be a more meaningful indicator of burden than raw miles.

The burden varies by service type. **Specialty and subspecialty care require the longest trips**. Cancer treatment, cardiology, maternal-fetal medicine, and behavioral health often exist only in regional centers. Rural patients needing these services face round trips of two hours or more, with all the cascading costs that distance implies. One study found that veterans reported travel distance as the strongest barrier to healthcare, with 33% endorsing it as a significant obstacle.

Scheduling burden compounds distance. Healthcare systems optimize appointment times around provider convenience and facility efficiency, not patient reality. Working hours conflict with appointment availability. Employers do not always accommodate healthcare needs. The rural resident who cannot take time off work without losing pay faces a direct trade-off between health and income that urban patients with flexible professional jobs may never experience.

Information burden grows as healthcare systems digitize. **Patient portals assume broadband access** that 17% of rural residents lack. Prior authorization requirements generate paperwork that demands health literacy many patients do not possess. Referral systems create mazes where finding the next step requires persistence, access, and knowledge of how systems work. Each point of friction is minor for patients with resources and education. Each point becomes a potential break point for patients without them.

Financial burden layers onto all other burdens. High-deductible health plans expose patients to thousands of dollars in costs before insurance pays anything. Rural residents are more likely to be uninsured or underinsured. Even with coverage, cost uncertainty makes healthcare utilization a financial gamble. The 2024 AMA survey found that prior authorization creates significant delays and burden for both physicians and patients, with 94% of physicians reporting care delays and 79% reporting treatment abandonment.

Cognitive burden may be the least visible but most pervasive dimension. **Navigating complex systems while sick taxes the very capacities that illness depletes**. Understanding insurance benefits, coordinating care across multiple providers, tracking medications and appointments, completing forms that assume clarity of thought: these tasks are manageable when health permits. When illness impairs energy, concentration, or mood, they become overwhelming.

## Tensions and Dynamics

The central tension in healthcare navigation is the **gap between system design and patient reality**. Healthcare systems are designed to optimize provider workflow, payer administration, and facility efficiency. They are not designed around the actual constraints that patients face. The language of "patient-centered care" has become ubiquitous in healthcare, yet the systems described as patient-centered often impose burdens that no patient would choose.

Consider the prior authorization process. From the payer perspective, prior authorization ensures medical necessity, controls costs, and prevents inappropriate utilization. From the patient perspective, it delays needed care by an average of several days, generates paperwork that may be difficult to complete, and sometimes results in denial of treatments that physicians have determined necessary. The 2024 AMA survey found that physicians handle 39 to 45 prior authorization requests per week, spending approximately 13 hours on these tasks. That burden falls not just on physicians but ultimately on patients whose care is delayed or denied.

Patient portals illustrate similar tensions. From the system perspective, portals improve efficiency, reduce phone calls, and enable patients to access their own records. From the rural patient perspective, portals require internet access that may be unavailable or unreliable, digital literacy that may be limited, and technology devices that may not be present. Research shows that **portal adoption is lowest among populations with the greatest access barriers**, creating a situation where technology intended to improve access instead widens disparities.

A deeper tension exists between **individual responsibility and structural barriers**. When patients do not complete referrals, miss appointments, or fail to adhere to treatment plans, healthcare systems often frame this as "non-compliance." The problem is located in the patient: insufficient motivation, poor health literacy, resistance to medical advice. This framing obscures the structural barriers that make compliance difficult or impossible. The patient who misses a follow-up appointment may have lacked transportation, could not afford the copay, or could not get time off work. Attributing failure to individual deficiency rather than system design ensures that the system will not change.

The alternative view holds that current systems, while imperfect, represent reasonable trade-offs. Portals do improve efficiency for those who use them. Prior authorization does prevent some inappropriate care. Scheduling optimization does reduce wait times. Navigation tools are available for patients who seek them out. From this perspective, burden is an unfortunate but necessary cost of healthcare complexity.

This view mistakes system convenience for patient benefit. Efficiency gains that accrue to providers and payers while imposing costs on patients are not neutral trade-offs. They represent **value extraction from those least able to bear it**. When a prior authorization denial forces a patient to choose between appealing (requiring time and persistence they may not have) or abandoning treatment, the system has failed that patient regardless of what efficiencies it achieves elsewhere.

## Vignette: The Portal That Helps No One

The letter arrived on a Tuesday, explaining that Mountain Regional Health had upgraded its patient portal. All communications, test results, appointment requests, and prescription renewals would now be handled through MyChart. Patients should log in using their email address and create a secure password following the guidelines provided.

Sarah Bowman read the letter twice. She does not have an email address. Her phone is the prepaid kind you buy minutes for at the Walmart in Johnstown, and it does not really do internet. Her daughter set up a Gmail account for her once, but she cannot remember the password and besides, she never used it.

She called the number on the letter. After eleven minutes on hold, a pleasant voice explained that she could create an account at the library if she did not have internet at home. The library is eighteen miles away and closes at 5 p.m. on weekdays. Sarah gets off work at 4:30, which means she would arrive at 4:48 assuming no delays. She has twelve minutes to create an email account, register for MyChart, remember multiple passwords, and learn to navigate a system designed by people who have never thought twice about these steps.

The voice also explained that she could request a "proxy" to manage her account if she had difficulty with technology. The proxy would need to complete a form available on the website.

The following month, Sarah's medication renewal did not go through because the request had been sent via portal and no one responded. She learned this when she ran out of pills and called the pharmacy. The pharmacist spent fifteen minutes navigating the problem, eventually reaching a nurse who manually processed the renewal. The pharmacist told Sarah, kindly but wearily, that this happens several times a week.

"You really should get on the portal," she said. "That's how everything works now."

Sarah knows how everything works now. She knows that everything works for people who are not her.

## Determinants and Dynamics

Navigation burden emerges from the interaction of multiple factors, some geographic, some systemic, and some reflecting assumptions embedded in how healthcare operates.

**Geographic reality** creates the foundation. Rural residents live farther from services not because they choose to but because healthcare facilities locate where population density supports them. The hospital closure crisis has widened these gaps. Since 2010, 182 rural hospitals have either closed or converted to models that do not provide inpatient care. Nearly 60% of rural hospitals no longer deliver babies. When facilities close, the distances that patients must travel increase correspondingly.

**Transportation infrastructure** compounds geography. Rural public transit barely exists in most communities. Volunteer driver programs help but cannot meet demand. Medical transportation services have limited reach. This leaves patients dependent on personal vehicles, which assumes vehicle ownership, reliable vehicles, ability to drive, and resources to cover fuel costs. One study found that having a personal driver's license doubled the number of chronic care visits in a year. Patients without licenses, or without reliable transportation, simply receive less care.

**Healthcare system design** creates friction that accumulates. Electronic health records were mandated partly to improve coordination, yet many systems do not communicate with each other. Patients moving between facilities may face duplicate testing, conflicting medication lists, and providers unaware of previous care. Rural hospitals report that transferring records remains a "chore" so burdensome it often goes undone.

Prior authorization has expanded dramatically despite consistent evidence of harm. The AMA reports that 95% of physicians say prior authorization contributes to burnout. More importantly for patients, research shows that prior authorization requirements imposed unequally have disparate impact on historically marginalized groups, including rural populations. Paperwork that is merely tedious for someone with resources and education becomes an **insurmountable obstacle** for patients with learning disabilities, limited literacy, or no internet access.

**Health literacy gaps** interact with system complexity. Healthcare communications assume reading levels and background knowledge that many patients do not possess. Insurance explanations of benefits are notoriously difficult to interpret. Medical terminology creates barriers even when patients are highly educated in other domains. The cognitive burden of decoding complex information falls disproportionately on those with less education, those managing multiple chronic conditions, and those whose health conditions impair cognitive function.

**Financial exposure** has increased as health plans shift costs to patients. High-deductible plans expose patients to thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket costs. Cost uncertainty makes healthcare utilization a financial gamble. Rural residents, who have lower average incomes than urban residents, face these costs with fewer resources. The result is care delayed, foregone, or abandoned because patients cannot afford it.

## Transformation Implications

If navigation burden is structural rather than individual, then addressing it requires changing structures rather than educating patients to navigate existing systems more effectively. RHTP investments can either reduce burden or shift it, and the difference determines whether transformation improves rural health or adds new frustrations.

**Bringing services to people** reduces burden more effectively than expecting people to reach services. Mobile health units, community-based screening, and traveling specialists reduce the distance that patients must travel. Telehealth can substitute for some in-person visits, though it requires infrastructure and digital literacy that not all patients possess. The goal should be minimizing the travel, time, and cost required to access necessary care.

**Community health workers reduce navigation burden** by providing human assistance with system navigation. When someone helps patients understand their insurance, schedule appointments, arrange transportation, and complete paperwork, the cognitive and practical burdens that otherwise accumulate can be managed. This is not merely a convenience but a recognition that complex systems require support that patients cannot always provide for themselves.

**System redesign** rather than patient education addresses root causes. Eliminating unnecessary prior authorization requirements removes friction. Simplifying portal requirements or providing alternatives for patients who cannot access technology addresses digital exclusion. Coordinating scheduling around patient constraints rather than provider convenience acknowledges that patient time has value. Each design choice either adds or reduces burden; transformation should systematically choose reduction.

**Financial burden requires financial solutions**. Cost uncertainty can be addressed through price transparency and predictable cost structures. Transportation costs can be subsidized for patients who cannot afford them. Coverage gaps can be addressed through policy interventions that ensure rural residents can access care regardless of ability to pay. Programs that address other dimensions of burden while leaving financial exposure unchanged help some patients but not those for whom cost is the primary barrier.

The alternative view suggests that some burden is inevitable in complex systems and that patient responsibility for managing their own care is appropriate. There is some truth here. Healthcare systems cannot eliminate all complexity, and patients do have some responsibility for their own health. But the current distribution of burden is not neutral or necessary. It reflects design choices that could be made differently and that systematically disadvantage those with the fewest resources.

## Conclusion

What rural patients experience when they seek healthcare is not just inconvenience but a systematic extraction of time, money, energy, and hope. Systems designed for provider efficiency and payer administration impose costs on the people those systems ostensibly serve. The burden is not equally distributed; it falls heaviest on those who can bear it least.

This matters for transformation because **burden determines whether patients engage**. The most evidence-based intervention fails if patients cannot get to it, cannot afford it, or cannot navigate the systems required to access it. Telehealth reduces travel burden but requires technology infrastructure. Care coordination reduces cognitive burden but requires trusting someone to help. Payment reform reduces financial burden but takes years to implement. No single intervention addresses all dimensions, and approaches that address some burdens while ignoring others provide only partial relief.

The deeper issue is what navigation burden reveals about how healthcare systems view rural patients. When systems impose burdens that patients cannot bear and then document "non-compliance" when patients fail to meet system expectations, the burden itself becomes invisible. The problem is located in the patient rather than the system. This framing allows structures to persist unchanged.

Transformation that takes burden seriously must ask different questions. Not "why don't patients comply?" but "what does compliance require that patients cannot provide?" Not "how can we educate patients to navigate better?" but "how can we redesign systems so navigation is less burdensome?" The shift from patient deficiency to system redesign is not merely rhetorical. It determines whether transformation addresses the actual barriers that prevent rural Americans from receiving the care they need.
