## The Hidden Resources Work Requirements Assume

*Series 15: Human Dimensions of Work Requirements*

Two people receive identical work verification notices on the same Tuesday. Both are expansion adults earning approximately $22,000 annually, both working irregular hours, both facing the same 45-day deadline.

Sarah reads the notice over dinner with her partner, who spent three years in HR before their current retail management job. Her partner recognizes immediately what the form requires and knows Sarah's employer maintains a pay stub portal. They draft a quick plan: pull records at lunch tomorrow, upload that evening. By Thursday, Sarah has submitted her documentation.

Marcus reads the same notice alone in his efficiency apartment after a ten-hour landscaping shift. He's not sure what "verification of work hours" means, exactly. His employer pays cash weekly, writing hours on slips Marcus generally throws away. He doesn't know anyone who's dealt with Medicaid paperwork. He puts the notice on his kitchen counter, intending to figure it out this weekend. The weekend passes. The notice migrates to a stack of papers by the door. Forty-four days later, it's still there. Marcus loses his Medicaid coverage not because he refused to comply, not because he wasn't working, but because **he lacked the invisible resources that made compliance possible for Sarah**.

Same requirement. Same deadline. Same income level. Vastly different outcomes. The difference between them has nothing to do with work and everything to do with capital.

## Capital Beyond Money

The French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu spent his career demonstrating that economic capital, the money and material resources people possess, represents only one form of the advantages that shape life outcomes. In his foundational 1986 essay "The Forms of Capital," Bourdieu identified three fundamental types: **economic capital** (financial resources and material assets), **cultural capital** (knowledge, skills, educational credentials, and familiarity with dominant cultural forms), and **social capital** (the networks of relationships and group memberships that provide access to resources and opportunities). Each form can, under certain conditions, be converted into the others, and each operates according to its own logic while contributing to the reproduction of social advantage across generations.

Bourdieu's framework emerged from his studies of French education and elite cultural reproduction, but its explanatory power extends far beyond those contexts. The insight that mattered most was deceptively simple: **the resources that enable success in institutional settings are not equally distributed, and income measurement captures only a fraction of the relevant inequality**. Two families with identical incomes may possess radically different amounts of cultural and social capital, leading to radically different outcomes when they encounter the same institutional demands.

Work requirement verification systems assess income to determine eligibility. Someone earning below 138 percent of the federal poverty level qualifies for Medicaid expansion coverage. But the systems assume that everyone meeting this threshold possesses equivalent capacity to navigate the verification process itself. They do not. The Sarah and Marcus of the opening vignette have the same income. They do not have the same capital. The verification system recognizes only the former while depending entirely on the latter.

This mismatch between what systems measure and what outcomes require lies at the heart of why work requirements produce such different results across populations that appear, on paper, to be similarly situated. Understanding this requires examining how each form of capital operates in the specific context of Medicaid work requirement compliance.

## Social Capital and the Navigation Network

When the verification notice arrives, who can you call? This seemingly simple question determines outcomes more than perhaps any other factor in work requirement compliance. Social capital consists of the actual and potential resources linked to durable networks of relationships, the collective sum of connections through which an individual can access help, information, and practical support.

For Sarah, that network included a partner with relevant professional knowledge. It might also include a coworker who navigated Medicaid verification last year, a family member at a social services agency, or a neighbor who mentioned a community organization that helps with paperwork. **The invisible infrastructure of relationships transforms an opaque bureaucratic requirement into a solvable problem**.

For Marcus, that network is thin or absent. No one in his immediate circle has dealt with Medicaid verification. His coworkers struggle with similar challenges. When he encounters a form he doesn't understand, he has no one to ask. When he needs a ride to the county office, he has no one to drive him. When he forgets about the deadline, no one reminds him.

Robert Putnam's "Bowling Alone" documented the decades-long erosion of American social capital. That decline has not been uniform. **The populations most likely to be subject to Medicaid work requirements are also those who have experienced the sharpest declines in social connection**. Residential instability disrupts neighborhood networks. Shift work makes sustained relationship maintenance difficult. Economic precarity strains family ties.

Sociologist Mario Small's research on "unanticipated gains" illuminates another dimension. Significant social capital emerges from routine institutional affiliations that middle-class life entails: parent associations, professional organizations, religious congregations. These affiliations generate connections as a byproduct of participation, connections later mobilizable for navigating bureaucratic systems. **Populations with fewer stable institutional affiliations accumulate fewer of these incidental network resources**.

The verification deadline approaches. Someone with robust social capital might receive a text message reminder from a friend who saw their notice on the counter. They might get a call from a case manager at a clinic they've used before. They might encounter a flyer about verification assistance at the church they attended last Sunday. Someone without those connections faces the deadline alone, and the deadline, like all bureaucratic deadlines, does not care about isolation.

## Cultural Capital and Administrative Literacy

Understanding what a verification notice asks for requires "administrative literacy," the capacity to decode institutional communications, recognize what documentation "really" means, and navigate implicit bureaucratic expectations. This is cultural capital, deeply connected to educational attainment and childhood socialization, that remains invisible until its absence produces failure.

Annette Lareau's ethnographic masterpiece "Unequal Childhoods" documented how middle-class parents engage in **"concerted cultivation"**, deliberately developing children's capacity to interact with institutions. Middle-class children learn to question authority figures, articulate needs, and navigate organizational expectations. Working-class and poor children more often experience "accomplishment of natural growth," emphasizing respect for authority but providing less preparation for institutional navigation.

These childhood differences have lasting consequences. The adult raised to question a doctor's diagnosis is prepared to question a denial letter. The adult who learned to maintain school records knows how to maintain employment verification. **The adult who absorbed, through dinner-table conversations, how bureaucratic institutions operate approaches verification forms with unconscious competence that cannot easily be taught at age thirty**.

Cultural capital in work requirements operates at multiple levels. At the most basic: knowing what "attestation" means, understanding that "verification" requires documentation not verbal assurance. At deeper levels: understanding that government forms require particular responses, that official deadlines function differently than informal ones, that there are right and wrong ways to present information to bureaucratic systems.

First-generation engagement with complex systems compounds these challenges. Marcus isn't just facing Medicaid verification for the first time. He may be facing sustained engagement with formal bureaucratic systems for the first time in his adult life. He lacks accumulated learning from navigating student loan paperwork, housing applications, or professional licensing. **Every verification form assumes a reservoir of prior experience. For those without that reservoir, every form is first contact with an alien system**.

## Economic Capital's Hidden Role

Work requirements apply to populations with income below 138 percent of the federal poverty level. By definition, everyone subject to verification has limited economic capital. But income eligibility does not exhaust the economic dimensions of compliance capacity. **Within the income-eligible population, significant variation in economic resources shapes who can successfully navigate verification**.

Begin with technology access. Digital submission has become the preferred verification pathway. This assumes smartphone ownership with adequate data plans, or home internet with a working computer. It assumes printers when systems fail, or scanners for documents that exist only on paper. Someone whose phone was disconnected last month cannot complete digital verification.

Transportation costs present another barrier. When digital submission fails, in-person visits become necessary. For someone without a car, this means transit fare or Uber costs. For someone with an unreliable vehicle, it means gambling the car will start that morning. For someone rural without transit, it may mean compensating someone to drive an hour each way. **The unfunded costs of proving eligibility fall entirely on those least able to bear them**.

Time itself is an economic resource. Hourly workers cannot typically leave shifts to visit county offices during limited business hours without losing wages. Someone working two part-time jobs may have no hours when both employment and bureaucratic access are possible. The trade-off between income and compliance creates impossible calculations for people with no margin.

Childcare during verification activities presents yet another hidden cost. The parent bringing children to the county office faces longer waits and more difficult form completion. The parent paying for childcare has spent money they may not have on maintaining coverage that someone with more resources would retain automatically.

These economic dimensions are not assessed or accommodated. Someone earning $22,000 annually with stable housing, reliable transportation, and family support for childcare faces an entirely different landscape than someone earning the same with housing instability, no car, and children to manage alone. **Income equality does not mean capital equality**.

## The Convertibility Problem

Bourdieu emphasized that capitals convert into one another, though with friction and under specific conditions. Someone with economic capital can purchase cultural capital through education and training. Someone with social capital can mobilize network connections to generate economic opportunity. Someone with cultural capital can deploy educational credentials to gain access to elite social networks. The forms are distinct but interconnected, each enabling accumulation of the others.

For populations subject to work requirements, this convertibility operates in reverse. Limited economic capital constrains the social capital that might develop through stable residential community. Limited social capital means fewer pathways to the cultural capital that might come from knowing someone who knows how systems work. Limited cultural capital makes it harder to leverage whatever economic resources exist into effective bureaucratic navigation. **The capitals that poverty diminishes are precisely the capitals that navigating poverty's bureaucratic consequences requires**.

This creates a paradox that work requirement systems do not acknowledge. The conditions that lead someone to need Medicaid, low income, unstable employment, limited education, thin social networks, tend to be the same conditions that make verification difficult. The system conditions healthcare on demonstrating work activity. But work activity verification requires resources that the working poor disproportionately lack. **The requirement is not equally difficult across the eligible population; it is systematically more difficult for those with fewer capitals, regardless of income**.

Marcus works more hours than Sarah in our opening vignette. His landscaping job demands physical labor from dawn to evening, leaving him exhausted in ways that office work does not produce. He is neither lazy nor disengaged from the labor force. But his work does not generate pay stubs, does not involve an employer with HR systems, does not leave time and energy for bureaucratic navigation, and does not embed him in networks where someone might help him figure out what to do. **He possesses less capital despite more work**.

## Navigation as Capital Substitution

Community organizations providing navigation assistance operate, in Bourdieusian terms, as capital substitution infrastructure. They supply the social capital that isolated individuals lack (someone to call), the cultural capital that institutional novices need (knowledge of how to complete forms), and the economic capital that the working poor cannot spare (free services, flexible hours, transportation assistance). Navigation is not simply helping individuals with paperwork; it is **temporarily providing the capital that unequal social structures have failed to distribute**.

This framing clarifies both importance and limits. On importance: if compliance depends on capital, and capital is unequally distributed, then equity requires either redistributing capital or substituting it. Navigation substitutes. It gives Marcus access to knowledge Sarah's partner possessed. It provides reminder networks Sarah's connections provided. Without navigation infrastructure, **work requirements function as a capital test disguised as a work test**.

On limits: capital substitution is expensive, and navigation cannot fully substitute for deeper advantages. A navigator can help Marcus complete verification this month. They cannot install networks that would remind him next month. They cannot provide childhood socialization that would make bureaucratic forms feel navigable. Navigation addresses symptoms of capital inequality. It does not address capital inequality itself.

The populations with greatest navigation needs are also those navigation infrastructure struggles to reach. Someone with social capital will hear about services through networks. Someone without may not know services exist. Someone with cultural capital recognizes navigation organizations as resources. Someone without may view them with institutional suspicion. **The capital deficits that make navigation necessary also make accessing navigation more difficult**.

## What Systems Assume

Work requirement verification systems embody assumptions about users. The current approach assumes people will:

Receive and read official notices in a timely fashion (social capital: someone checking mail; cultural capital: recognizing official correspondence; economic capital: stable mailing address).

Understand what notices ask for (cultural capital: bureaucratic literacy; social capital: someone to explain if unclear).

Know where to find required documentation (cultural capital: awareness of records; economic capital: employers with formal recordkeeping).

Be able to access and submit documentation (economic capital: technology, transportation, time; cultural capital: technical literacy).

Complete processes before deadlines expire (social capital: deadline reminders; economic capital: scheduling flexibility).

Respond effectively to problems and denials (cultural capital: appeals knowledge; social capital: access to assistance).

**Each assumption represents a capital demand that systems do not assess and do not provide**. Someone meeting all assumptions finds verification straightforward. Someone failing on multiple dimensions finds it impossible regardless of actual work status. The verification tests capital, not work.

This is not a design flaw in the sense that someone made a mistake. It reflects that systems are typically designed by people with abundant capital for populations with less. The policy analysts, software developers, and administrators who create verification systems navigate bureaucracy with unconscious ease. **Their systems reflect their experience rather than the experience of those who will use them**.

## Design Implications

If work requirement compliance depends on capital as much as work, several design implications follow.

**First, systems could minimize capital demands rather than maximize them**. Auto-populated forms reduce cultural capital needed to know what to enter. Automated data matching eliminates economic capital for documentation gathering. Shorter timelines with frequent reminders compensate for social capital that might otherwise provide reminders informally. Every design choice either assumes capital or substitutes for it.

**Second, navigation infrastructure could be funded proportionally to capital deficits**. Communities with thin networks, low educational attainment, and concentrated poverty require more intensive navigation than communities where informal capital is abundant.

**Third, outcome measurement could distinguish between work non-compliance and capital-related verification failure**. Marcus losing coverage because he lacked navigation capacity is categorically different from someone losing coverage because they don't qualify for exemption. Conflating these cases obscures what work requirements accomplish.

**Fourth, good cause exceptions could explicitly recognize capital barriers**. Someone who failed verification for lack of transportation, technology, or understanding has not demonstrated refusal to comply. They have demonstrated what capital deficits produce when systems assume what people lack.

## The Cruelest Form of Means-Testing

Means-testing in social programs typically refers to income-based eligibility determination. Someone whose income exceeds a threshold does not qualify; someone below the threshold does. Whatever the merits of this approach, it has the virtue of transparency. People know what the test is. They know whether they pass.

Work requirements introduce a different kind of means-testing, a test of capital rather than income. But because the test is not made explicit, people do not know they are being tested. They believe they are being asked to demonstrate work activity. They are actually being asked to demonstrate the social, cultural, and economic resources necessary to navigate a verification system designed without them in mind.

**Marcus works**. He is not failing a work test. He is failing a capital test that pretends to be a work test. The requirement tells him that his problem is not enough work activity. His actual problem is not enough of the invisible resources that would make documenting work activity possible. When he loses coverage, the system records non-compliance. What actually occurred was something more like exclusion by design.

Work requirements formally demand work. They informally demand networks, knowledge, and economic cushion. The formal demand is the policy's stated logic. The informal demands determine who actually loses coverage. Until systems account for this gap, **the verification process will continue to sort people not by work but by the capitals they possess or lack**. Sarah will submit her documentation and move on with her life. Marcus will join the millions whose coverage depends on resources the system assumes but does not provide.

The sociological literature on capital and inequality was not developed with Medicaid work requirements in mind. But it illuminates what is happening with uncomfortable precision. Bourdieu's insight that capital comes in multiple forms, that these forms are unequally distributed, and that institutions reward capitals they do not assess applies directly to the administrative gauntlet that work requirements create. Understanding this does not resolve the policy debate. It clarifies what the policy debate is actually about.
