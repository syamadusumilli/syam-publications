# What Health Insurers Can Do: Turning Enrollment Volatility Into Care Continuity

*Medicaid managed care faces unprecedented churn. The strategic question is how to adapt.*

## The Fiscal Viability Question

Medicaid managed care organizations have spent the past decade building business models around predictable assumptions: relatively stable enrollment, utilization patterns that follow member acuity, quality metrics that reward care continuity, and value-based arrangements where 12-18 month care coordination investments pay off through prevented acute care. OB3's work requirements beginning December 2026 upend every one of these assumptions simultaneously.

The fundamental problem isn't just that 18.5 million people will face new administrative requirements. It's that the requirements create enrollment volatility uncorrelated with medical risk. Arkansas's 2018 implementation demonstrated the pattern: 18,000 people lost coverage in ten months, but research showed most were actually working or qualified for exemptions—they simply couldn't navigate documentation. The diabetic Uber driver couldn't document gig income. The construction worker switching contractors mid-month missed reporting deadlines. The single mother managing her child's asthma qualified for caregiver exemption but couldn't get paperwork processed.

This creates what actuaries call adverse selection in reverse. Documentation-capable people stay enrolled regardless of health status while documentation-challenged people cycle out regardless of health need. Historical utilization patterns become nearly useless for predicting future costs. The business model built on actuarial predictability faces systematic unpredictability.

For the 18.5 million adults subject to OB3's work requirements beginning December 2026, managed care organizations face systematic volatility that cascades through every operational aspect. If similar patterns apply nationally, plans could see 30-40% annual churn rates in expansion populations—far exceeding baseline Medicaid turnover. The actuarial foundations of managed care—built on relative enrollment stability—face fundamental disruption.

## The Cascade of Dysfunction

The operational impacts compound. Consider chronic disease management. Your plan invests in a diabetic member over six months: comprehensive assessment, medication optimization, specialist coordination. The investment pays off as A1C comes under control and emergency visits decline. Then the member loses coverage because she missed a work verification deadline during a family crisis. Three months later, when she navigates appeals and gets reinstated, her A1C has jumped two points, she's developed early neuropathy, and she's been to the emergency department twice. Nine months of care coordination investment is partially erased.

Multiply this across thousands of members and actuarial models predicting next quarter's costs become unreliable. Medical loss ratio targets assumed stable populations with predictable utilization curves. Churn creates sawtooth patterns—members cycling through periods of managed care and unmanaged deterioration. When enrolled, they're in crisis recovery mode with higher acute utilization. When out, they're getting sicker. When they return, they present with advanced disease states.

The care coordination team faces impossible math. If you expect a member to churn within six months, do you invest in comprehensive care management when payback periods typically run 12-18 months? Investing fully in someone who'll be gone in six months is actuarially irrational. Not investing guarantees poor outcomes during enrollment, damaging quality metrics and increasing costs. There's no good answer—only trade-offs.

Quality metrics designed for stable populations distort. HEDIS measures have continuous enrollment requirements. Star ratings that determine bonus payments face similar issues. You're competing with plans in states without work requirements whose populations have more stable coverage. Your diabetic population's outcomes look worse not because your diabetes program is inferior but because members cycle through coverage gaps that disrupt medication access and monitoring.

Value-based payment arrangements assume you can influence member behavior over meaningful periods. Shared savings calculations typically look at 12-month measurement periods with continuous enrollment requirements. Work requirements mean substantial portions of your expansion population don't meet continuous enrollment criteria, removing them from value-based payment success metrics. The members who most need care coordination are least likely to be included in shared savings calculations.

## The Stratification Dilemma

The logical response to unpredictable populations is stratification—dividing members into groups managed differently with resources allocated accordingly. But work requirements create two competing logics pointing in opposite directions.

The first logic stratifies by coverage stability. Invest heavily in members likely to maintain continuous enrollment: those with stable employers who help with verification, strong digital literacy, documented exemptions, or sufficient social support. For these members, traditional care coordination works—long-term care plans, intensive chronic disease management, preventive care focus. The payback period justifies investment.

For members at high risk of churning—gig workers, seasonal employees, those with unstable housing, limited English proficiency, episodic health conditions—operate with shorter time horizons. Front-load preventive services at enrollment, provide portable self-management tools, focus on acute intervention rather than long-term coordination. This optimizes care coordination spending.

But the second stratification logic cuts against this entirely. Coverage instability correlates with medical complexity and social vulnerability. The gig worker cycling on and off coverage likely has chronic conditions making traditional employment difficult. The person who can't navigate documentation systems probably struggles with medication management too. The individual with housing instability almost certainly has higher medical needs. Unstable coverage doesn't predict low medical risk—it predicts high medical risk combined with high social complexity.

If you stratify by coverage stability and reduce investment in volatile populations, you're reducing investment in people whose health will deteriorate most rapidly without intervention. When they cycle back, they return sicker and more expensive. The emergency visits, hospitalizations, and complications you didn't prevent during first enrollment hit your medical loss ratio when they return. Short-term savings from reduced care coordination gets overwhelmed by increased acute care costs.

The timing mismatch compounds the problem. Your costs for unmanaged deterioration often appear after re-enrollment. You saved on care coordination during first enrollment. But the expensive hospitalization from uncontrolled hypertension happens during second enrollment. Your actuarial attribution model sees high costs in the second period without connecting them to under-investment in the first period.

The question becomes: optimize for short-term operational efficiency by matching investment to expected enrollment duration, or optimize for total population health and long-term cost control by investing most heavily in people most likely to get expensive when care breaks down? The two optimization problems point in opposite directions.

## The Rate Negotiation Paradox

The textbook response to increased costs and risk is negotiating higher capitation rates. Work requirements create new administrative burden, care coordination complexity, and utilization uncertainty. Document these costs and request rate adjustments reflecting the new reality.

But this negotiation happens in a political economy where states implemented work requirements partly to reduce Medicaid spending. The Congressional Budget Office scored OB3's work requirements as saving $344 billion through reduced enrollment. States expect savings, not increased per-member costs. When managed care plans request rate increases because work requirements make populations harder to manage, states hear: "The policy we implemented to save money is costing more money."

The dynamics are complex because plans and states have asymmetric information. Plans have detailed utilization data showing increased costs. States have enrollment data showing reduced coverage. From the state's perspective, if enrollment drops 15% but total spending only drops 10%, retained members appear more expensive, suggesting rate reductions. From the plan's perspective, members who left were relatively healthy (documentation-capable, not documentation-challenged), so the remaining pool is higher acuity, justifying rate increases.

Neither side has complete information about the counterfactual. Are increased per-member costs due to work requirement churn or underlying medical trend? Is risk pool composition actually changing or are plans managing less effectively? Without randomized trials, these questions are empirically unresolvable.

Political optics compound the challenge. Managed care plans requesting rate increases while people lose healthcare coverage creates terrible optics, even if actuarially justified. States might accept that volatile populations cost more and adjust rates accordingly, but this creates new problems. If rates include premiums for work requirement administration, plans have financial incentive for requirements to continue. If rates are risk-adjusted for coverage instability, plans might not invest optimally in preventing that instability.

More likely, rates won't fully adjust to cover increased costs, at least initially. States will allow some adjustment but less than plans request. Plans will absorb some volatility through operational efficiency. This creates pressure to manage expansion populations at lower cost per member, bringing back the stratification dilemma with sharper trade-offs.

## Working Within State Infrastructure

The instinct when facing operational challenges is building proprietary solutions. Plans see gaps in state systems and consider building their own navigation infrastructure, documentation assistance programs, employer partnerships, and tracking platforms.

This instinct is understandable but potentially counterproductive. If every plan builds separate navigation infrastructure, the result is fragmentation making things worse for members. The unemployed member trying to find qualifying volunteer opportunities gets five different calls from five different insurers offering help, but none coordinate with each other or the state's official system. The employer gets verification requests in five different formats from five different entities. The community organization doesn't know which plan's system to use for which members.

The chaos multiplies when state and plan systems diverge. A member obtains medical exemption through their plan's provider network, but the state's system doesn't recognize it because it wasn't submitted through official channels. An employer provides verification to the plan, but the state never receives it and terminates coverage.

The more rational approach is working within and extending state infrastructure rather than creating parallel systems. If the state has an official work requirement portal, integrate with it rather than building separate portals. If the state contracted with community organizations for navigation, coordinate with those organizations rather than hiring competing navigators. If the state established exemption processes, help members navigate those processes rather than creating alternative pathways.

This means engaging with states at policy and operational levels during work requirement design and implementation. Before verification systems are built, advocate for integration points—APIs allowing plan systems to check member verification status, feed member information into state processes, and receive real-time updates. Before exemption processes are finalized, push for streamlined documentation leveraging existing provider relationships rather than requiring separate bureaucratic pathways.

The care coordination integration matters enormously. State work requirement systems typically operate separately from healthcare delivery systems. Eligibility workers track employment hours; care coordinators track health status. But for the member with diabetes qualifying for medical exemption based on complications, these should be the same conversation. The endocrinologist managing her care is best positioned to document that disease severity prevents full-time work.

Plans should advocate for state processes enabling healthcare integration. Allow providers to document medical exemptions through normal clinical workflows with attestations flowing directly to eligibility systems. Let care coordinators identify potential exemptions during regular care management and initiate exemption processes on behalf of members. Create feedback loops where eligibility systems notify care coordinators when members risk losing coverage.

The human layer becomes critical. Automated verification works well for straightforward employment, but complex cases need human judgment. The member working 30 hours at one job and 20 at another but only getting documentation from the first employer needs someone to work through the gap. The member with episodic health conditions flaring this month needs flexibility in exemption application. The member who lost their job but is actively searching needs bridge support during transition.

States rarely have capacity for nuanced case management. They have eligibility workers processing hundreds of determinations monthly following standardized rules. Health plans have care coordinators who know members individually, understand health trajectories, and have time for complex problem-solving. Rather than building separate navigation services, the more effective model is plans extending state capacity by deploying care coordinators as work requirement support for complex cases.

This requires formal coordination mechanisms: regular meetings between plan care coordination leadership and state eligibility policy teams, shared case conferencing for members stuck in coverage gaps despite apparent eligibility, data sharing agreements letting plans see eligibility status in real-time, and clear escalation pathways when plan navigators identify system problems needing state-level resolution.

## Leveraging SDOH and HRSN Infrastructure

Over the past five years, Medicaid managed care invested heavily in addressing social determinants of health. Plans contracted with community-based organizations for food security, housing stability, and transportation access. They built screening tools identifying social needs during care encounters. They hired community health workers bridging clinical care and social services. Some launched dedicated SDOH management platforms coordinating community resource referrals.

Work requirements create new demand for exactly the infrastructure these SDOH initiatives built. The member who can't get to work verification appointments because of transportation barriers is the same member your SDOH program identified for transportation support. The member struggling to gather documentation because of housing instability is the same member your care coordinators help find stable housing.

Rather than building separate work requirement navigation as distinct function, integrate it into existing SDOH care coordination. When community health workers conduct home visits addressing food insecurity, they can also help gather employment documentation. When care coordinators help members find stable housing, they can simultaneously help document caregiver exemptions related to housing instability. When plans coordinate transportation to medical appointments, extend that to transportation for verification appointments.

Contracted community organizations already embedded in neighborhoods are natural extension points. The food bank where your SDOH program sends members can become a place where members bring paystubs to be scanned and uploaded. The housing assistance organization can help document exemptions for people whose housing instability makes consistent work difficult. The adult education program can automatically report education hours counting toward work requirements.

This integration serves multiple purposes simultaneously. Members get holistic support without understanding which needs are "health" versus "SDOH" versus "work requirements"—they get comprehensive help. Plans leverage existing infrastructure rather than building duplicative systems. Community organizations gain additional value proposition for partnerships with health plans beyond SDOH.

Technology platforms many plans deployed for SDOH coordination can be extended. If you have a community resource platform letting care coordinators search for food pantries and make electronic referrals, extend it to search for volunteer opportunities, job training programs, and employers willing to provide flexible verification. If you have closed-loop referral systems tracking whether members successfully connected to housing support, extend them to track work verification completion.

The case management model adapts naturally. Instead of SDOH care coordinators asking only "Do you have stable housing? Are you food secure?" they ask "Do you have stable housing? Are you food secure? Do you need help with work verification?" The conversation flows naturally because for members facing social complexity, these needs cluster together.

## Maintaining Connection Through Coverage Gaps

The most challenging operational question is what to do when members lose coverage despite prevention efforts. Some coverage loss is inevitable—members will miss deadlines, documentation won't arrive on time, exemptions won't process quickly enough, system errors will occur. When that happens, the member is no longer enrolled. You're not receiving capitation. Traditional managed care logic says stop providing services.

But that logic creates terrible outcomes. The diabetic who loses coverage stops taking insulin because she can't afford it. Three months later, when she resolves verification issues and re-enrolls, she's in diabetic ketoacidosis requiring hospitalization. Your plan bears that hospitalization cost. The preventive investment in her diabetes care is partially erased. You're starting over with a sicker, more expensive member.

The care coordination question becomes: Can you maintain some connection and support even during periods when members aren't enrolled, viewing it as investment in population health that pays off when they return? And if so, what level of engagement is appropriate given you're not being paid during coverage gaps?

The answer likely varies by member acuity and expected gap duration. For members with serious chronic conditions who you expect will re-enroll relatively quickly, maintaining minimal connection makes economic sense. A monthly check-in call. Text reminders about medication adherence. Connection to community resources for free or low-cost care. Information about prescription assistance programs. Crisis support access if they need urgent help. These are low-cost interventions preventing expensive deterioration.

For members with lower acuity or longer expected coverage gaps, the calculus differs. You can't afford full care coordination for non-enrolled members indefinitely. But you can provide access to self-service resources costing almost nothing to maintain. Keep their records in your system so when they re-enroll, care coordinators have immediate access to history. Send occasional automated messages reminding them you're available if they need help navigating back into coverage. Maintain their connection to community resources that aren't insurance-dependent.

Legal and regulatory questions require careful navigation. States might object to plans providing services to non-enrolled people, seeing it as inappropriate use of Medicaid dollars. But if services are funded from plan reserves rather than current capitation, and if they ultimately save money by preventing expensive complications, states should be agnostic. Contractual language matters—some contracts explicitly prohibit services to non-enrolled individuals; others are silent and could be interpreted to allow it.

Member communication approach matters enormously. You can't tell members "You lost your Medicaid coverage but we're keeping helping you anyway" because that creates confusion about insurance status. But you can say "You're not currently enrolled, but when you're ready to re-enroll, we're here to help. In the meantime, here are resources that might help you manage your health." The distinction is subtle but important—you're not providing insurance benefits, you're providing information and connection services supporting eventual re-enrollment.

Technology enablement makes this feasible at scale. Automated text message campaigns cost pennies per member per month. You can maintain low-touch engagement with thousands of disenrolled members for minimal cost. Messages can be condition-specific: diabetes management tips, blood pressure monitoring reminders, mental health crisis line information. Add links to community resources, information about re-enrollment pathways, and contact information for your care coordination team if they need human support.

The community health worker model extends naturally. CHWs aren't clinicians providing medical care; they're community members providing support and connection. When a member loses coverage, the CHW can maintain relationship through the coverage gap. Home visits might pause, but phone contact continues. The CHW becomes the continuity point—someone who knows the member, understands their situation, and can help navigate back to coverage when ready.

The measurement question is whether this investment pays off. Track re-enrollment rates among members who received gap support versus those who didn't. Monitor health status and utilization patterns when members re-enroll. Calculate cost of gap support services versus savings from prevented complications. If members who receive gap support return healthier, re-enroll faster, and use less acute care, the business case strengthens.

## The Strategic Choice Point

Medicaid managed care organizations face a genuine strategic choice. One path is optimizing narrowly—stratify by coverage stability, reduce investment in volatile populations, negotiate for higher rates or accept lower margins, and focus on managing stable populations well. This path minimizes short-term costs and protects financial sustainability in a challenging environment.

The other path is building infrastructure maintaining care continuity despite volatility—invest in navigation and exemption support, integrate work requirement assistance into existing SDOH coordination, maintain light-touch engagement through coverage gaps, document impacts, and work with states to improve the policy environment over time. This path requires upfront investment and accepts near-term financial pressure in exchange for long-term competitive advantage and population health outcomes.

Most plans will land somewhere in the middle. But the direction matters. Plans that view work requirements as operational burden to be minimized will make different decisions than plans viewing them as a new domain where managed care value proposition can be demonstrated. Plans that see volatile populations as unprofitable will manage them differently than plans seeing them as opportunities to prove care coordination works even in the hardest cases.

The coming years will reveal which approach succeeds. Or perhaps more accurately, they'll reveal both approaches are correct for different types of organizations in different markets with different risk appetites and competitive positions. The Medicaid managed care industry has always been heterogeneous—plans pursue different strategies, emphasize different capabilities, and succeed through different paths.

What seems certain is that OB3's work requirements will separate plans that can manage complexity from plans that struggle with it. The winners will be organizations building operational excellence in navigating volatility, integrating work requirement support seamlessly into existing care models, maintaining relationships and health status despite enrollment churn, and documenting impacts rigorously enough to shape future policy. The strugglers will be organizations treating work requirements as pure compliance burden, allowing care coordination to degrade as populations churn, and optimizing for short-term costs at expense of long-term outcomes.

Beginning December 2026, we'll begin to see which approach proves more successful.
