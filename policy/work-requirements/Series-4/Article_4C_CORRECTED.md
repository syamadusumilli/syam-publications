# Article 4C: Building Redetermination Infrastructure for Expansion Adults
## The Multi-Stakeholder Reality

Articles 4A and 4B established the problem. Semi-annual redetermination for expansion adults creates concentrated pressure affecting 18.5 million people who entered Medicaid through expansion pathways. These expansion adults face work verification and exemption renewal converging with standard eligibility checks every six months. Vulnerable populations with compounding barriers experience redetermination as recurring crisis. Standard processes fail predictably.

Meanwhile, the remaining 71.5 million Medicaid beneficiariesâ€”children, elderly, disabled populations who entered through traditional pathwaysâ€”continue annual redetermination cycles without work requirement complexity.

This article addresses what states, MCOs, employers, providers, and community organizations must actually build in fourteen months to serve expansion adult populations effectively. Not aspirational solutions. Pragmatic infrastructure decisions with available time, money, and workforce.

The structure matters. Redetermination isn't a technology problem requiring AI solutions. It's a coordination problem requiring aligned infrastructure across multiple stakeholders serving the expansion adult population specifically. Technology enables coordination. It doesn't substitute for stakeholder commitment and capacity.

## State Core Infrastructure: Expansion-Focused Capacity

States hold ultimate eligibility determination authority. Everything else depends on states building functional systems by January 2027 to handle both expansion adult semi-annual cycles and continuing annual cycles for other populations.

### Processing Volume Reality

Eligibility determination systems must handle approximately 20-25 percent increased annual processing volume, concentrated in expansion adult systems. The calculation: states currently process roughly 90 million annual determinations (71.5 million annual renewals for children, elderly, disabled, pregnant women, plus approximately 18.5 million annual renewals for expansion adults). Semi-annual cycles for expansion adults add approximately 18 million determinations annually (18.5 million people Ã— 2 cycles minus the 1 annual cycle they previously had). Total: approximately 108 million annual determinations versus previous 90 million, roughly 20 percent increase.

But this increase concentrates heavily in systems handling expansion adult eligibility. States need expanded capacity specifically for:
- Income verification for expansion populations
- Work verification integration for expansion adults  
- Exemption documentation processing for expansion populations
- Household composition updates affecting expansion eligibility

Technology systems handling children's Medicaid or disability pathway populations don't require significant expansion. The pressure falls on expansion adult processing infrastructure.

Legacy systems built for annual expansion adult renewal lack processing capacity for semi-annual cycles. States need either substantial system upgrades to expansion-focused modules or complete replacement of expansion adult eligibility systems. The fourteen-month timeline means most states must procure vendor solutions rather than building custom. RFP processes taking 6-12 months leave minimal time for implementation and testing.

### Data Integration Complexity

Data integration across verification streams creates single member view for expansion adults. Work verification data from Article 2A's distributed submission networks. Income verification from wage databases and tax systems. Exemption documentation from providers. Household composition updates. Address changes. These streams flowing separately must converge for expansion adult redetermination. Without integration, caseworkers manually compile information from disparate systems, creating processing bottlenecks and error rates.

The integration challenge: building systems that handle both semi-annual cycles for 18.5 million expansion adults AND annual cycles for 71.5 million other beneficiaries without confusing the two populations or applying wrong redetermination schedules.

### Staffing Requirements

Processing capacity requires adequate staffing concentrated in expansion adult eligibility units. States cannot simply spread existing staff across increased volume. They need approximately 20-25 percent more eligibility worker time, heavily concentrated in units handling expansion adults rather than distributed across all Medicaid populations.

Options: temporary surge staff for synchronized expansion adult cycles, or permanent increases for staggered cycles. Training new eligibility workers takes months. States starting hiring now might have trained staff by November 2026. States waiting until mid-2026 won't.

The challenge isn't just numbers. It's specialization. Eligibility workers processing expansion adult renewals need different training than workers processing children's Medicaid: work verification protocols, exemption evaluation, episodic employment pattern assessment. This specialized knowledge doesn't exist broadly in current workforce.

### Appeals Infrastructure Scaling

Appeals infrastructure must scale proportionally for expansion adult population. More frequent redetermination for these 18.5 million people means more coverage terminations means more appeals. Hearing officer capacity, legal review workflows, and continuation of benefits during appeals all require expansion focused on this population.

The appeals differ qualitatively too. Traditional Medicaid appeals involve income verification disputes or household composition disagreements. Expansion adult appeals add work verification disputes, exemption denials, and documentation timing issues requiring different expertise and procedures.

### Communication Automation for Multiple Populations

Communication automation generates personalized renewal notices based on member data and population type. The challenge: systems must send appropriate notices to expansion adults on semi-annual cycles while sending different notices to other populations on annual cycles. Generic form letters fail, as Article 4A discussed.

Systems must populate notices with specific information: your population category, your redetermination schedule, your current exemption status, documents needed for renewal, deadline dates, what happens if you don't respond. This requires database queries pulling member-specific data, population classification, and conditional logic generating appropriate guidance.

For expansion adults: notices must reference work requirements, exemption status, verification requirements. For children: notices reference household composition, income only. For traditional disabled: notices reference annual schedule, no work requirements. The automation complexity multiplies across population types.

### Technology Platform Decisions

Technology platform decisions happen now or never. Build versus buy versus adapt existing systems for expansion adult processing. Custom development offers maximum flexibility but requires capacity states typically lack. Vendor solutions promise faster deployment but may not accommodate state-specific expansion adult policy choices. Adapting existing eligibility platforms works only if current systems have adequate foundation for population-specific processing.

The critical decision: invest in expansion adult-specific systems or adapt universal systems to handle differential scheduling. Most states will choose hybrid approachesâ€”universal front-end portals with population-specific back-end processing rules. The decision must be made by early 2026 to allow time for implementation.

## MCO Operational Infrastructure: Market Segmentation Matters

Article 3B provided comprehensive MCO implementation checklist for work requirements generally. Redetermination requires specific infrastructure beyond that foundation. Critically: MCOs serving high proportions of expansion adults face greater infrastructure demands than plans focused on children, elderly, or traditional disabled populations.

### Risk Stratification for Expansion Adult Populations

Risk stratification models identify expansion adult members needing intensive renewal support. Article 3B discussed algorithms combining medical complexity, SDOH screening, historical engagement patterns, and demographic factors. For expansion adult redetermination, add timing factors: members with renewal deadlines during predicted high-stress periods, members with exemption expiration coinciding with renewal, members who struggled with previous renewals.

Risk scoring enables proactive outreach 90 days before deadline for expansion adult members rather than reactive response after coverage loss. MCOs serving primarily children or elderly populations can maintain simpler annual outreach cycles. The intensity requirement correlates directly with expansion adult enrollment proportion.

### Care Coordinator Workflow Integration

Care coordinator workflow integration makes expansion adult redetermination part of routine member contact, not separate administrative burden. Dashboard shows member's renewal status alongside clinical information: diabetes control, medication adherence, upcoming appointments, renewal deadline in 45 days. Care coordinator addresses health needs and renewal completion in same interaction.

For MCOs serving primarily expansion adults, this integration from Article 3B's redesigned workflows becomes critical during every member contact. For MCOs serving primarily other populations, simpler annual reminders may suffice. The operational complexity and cost burden varies dramatically by member mix.

### Documentation Facilitation Processes

Documentation facilitation processes help expansion adult members gather renewal materials without MCOs determining eligibility. Care coordinators can explain what documents are needed, help members request provider letters, verify that uploaded documents are complete before submission. Article 3B's payer-facilitated verification infrastructure applies: member photographs pay stub, care coordinator confirms it meets state requirements, MCO submits on member's behalf with appropriate permissions.

This facilitation requires technology platforms, trained staff, and state data sharing agreements concentrated in plans serving expansion adults. Plans serving primarily children or elderly populations need minimal documentation facilitation infrastructure since work verification doesn't apply.

### Gap Engagement Systems

Gap engagement systems maintain connection during coverage loss affecting expansion adults. Article 3A discussed automated text campaigns, condition-specific self-management resources, and re-enrollment navigation tools. During redetermination-caused gaps among expansion populations, this infrastructure prevents complete care disruption while members resolve renewal issues.

MCOs serving high proportions of expansion adults need robust gap engagement capabilities. Plans serving stable populations with annual cycles face less coverage volatility and require less sophisticated gap management.

### Capacity Planning and Market Dynamics

Capacity planning accounts for surge demand specific to expansion adult populations. Synchronized renewal cycles for expansion members create predictable volume spikes requiring temporary capacity expansion. Staggered cycles create continuous demand requiring sustained staffing levels. Article 3B's 14-month checklist included staffing models. Redetermination reveals whether those models adequately projected expansion adult workload.

The market segmentation matters for rate negotiations. MCOs with 80 percent expansion adult enrollment face different administrative costs than plans with 20 percent expansion adults and 80 percent children or elderly. States cannot simply apply across-the-board rates when expansion adults generate distinctly different processing demands. Rate structures must reflect differential burden.

## Employer Verification Infrastructure for Expansion Adult Workforces

Article 2A examined distributed submission networks for ongoing work verification. Redetermination creates different employer needs: bulk attestation capacity for expansion adult renewal periods.

### Large Employer Partnerships

Large employer partnerships enable automated verification for all Medicaid-eligible expansion adult employees facing renewal deadlines. HR systems flagged for June and December (synchronized cycles) or continuous monthly processing (staggered cycles) generate verification letters automatically.

The target: employers with significant expansion-eligible workforces. Retail, food service, hospitality, construction, gig economyâ€”industries employing the 18.5 million expansion adults. Traditional Medicaid populations (children, elderly, disabled) don't face work requirements, so their employers have no verification role. The employer engagement strategy must focus appropriately.

### Payroll Processor Integration

Payroll processor integration provides scalable solution for employers using ADP, Paychex, Gusto, and similar services. Instead of individual employer verification for expansion adult workers, processors attest for all client companies. States need processor API integration with eligibility systems enabling automated verification for millions of expansion adult workers whose employers lack internal capacity.

### Small Employer Support

Small employer support through industry associations spreads burden across businesses too small for individual capacity in industries employing expansion adults. Restaurant associations, construction industry groups, agricultural cooperatives, and chambers of commerce can provide member services including verification during renewal periods for their expansion-eligible workers.

States and MCOs coordinating with associations prevent duplicative outreach to same small employers. The focus: industries with high proportions of expansion adult employees.

### Gig Platform Cooperation

Gig platform cooperation matters enormously for expansion adult redetermination efficiency. Uber, DoorDash, Instacart, and other platforms can attest for all expansion adult workers facing renewal deadlines. Platform API integration with state systems enables automated verification. Without platform participation, hundreds of thousands of gig workers in expansion coverage face manual documentation gathering during renewal periods.

## Provider Documentation Infrastructure for Expansion Adults

Article 2B examined exemption systems and functional assessment approaches. Redetermination requires provider documentation infrastructure handling semi-annual renewal volume for expansion adults seeking medical exemptions.

### Exemption Renewal Workflows

Exemption renewal workflows integrate with clinical appointments for expansion adult patients. Someone with diabetes seeing endocrinologist every three months can get exemption renewal during routine visit rather than separate documentation request. Provider completes brief attestation during encounter: patient's condition still prevents work, exemption should continue.

This integration from Article 2B's design principles reduces burden on providers and expansion adult members while ensuring timely documentation. Providers serving primarily traditional disabled populations face simpler annual documentation cycles.

### Template Standardization

Template standardization enables rapid attestations for expansion adult exemptions. Article 2B discussed reducing 30-minute letters to 5-minute checkbox forms. For redetermination, templates must specify: exemption category, functional limitation description, expected duration, provider signature and credentials. Nothing more.

Excessive documentation requirements guarantee provider bottlenecks during expansion adult renewal periods. Simplified templates enable safety-net providers serving high proportions of expansion adults to sustain participation without overwhelming administrative burden.

### Provider Portals and EHR Integration

Provider portals enable direct submission to state systems without expansion adult member intermediation. Provider completes exemption renewal, clicks submit, attestation goes directly to state eligibility system. Member receives notification that provider submitted renewal.

EHR integration makes documentation part of clinical workflow for expansion adult populations rather than separate administrative task. Exemption renewal template populates with patient data from EHR. Provider reviews, confirms accuracy, submits. This integration from Article 2B reduces documentation time substantially.

### Compensation Considerations

Compensation for documentation time acknowledges unfunded work intensifying for expansion adult populations. Providers currently absorb exemption documentation as practice expense. With semi-annual cycles for 18.5 million expansion adults, the administrative burden doubles for this population subset. Recognizing this as billable service through administrative fees or stipends enables sustainable provider participation.

Safety-net clinics serving Medicaid populations are overwhelmed and understaffed. Adding semi-annual exemption renewals for expansion adult patients to existing clinical workload creates bottlenecks without additional support. States must decide whether access to exemptions matters enough to fund provider capacity appropriately.

## Community Organization Navigation Infrastructure

Article 2C examined human infrastructure and peer navigator models. Redetermination requires navigation capacity scaled to expansion adult population needs concentrated during renewal periods.

### Navigation Capacity Targeting

Navigation capacity must target expansion adults facing semi-annual cycles with work requirements. Children's Medicaid doesn't require navigation for work verification. Traditional disabled populations with annual cycles need less intensive support frequency. The navigation investment should concentrate on expansion adult populations and multiply-burdened members within that group.

### Peer Navigator Training

Peer navigator training must prepare navigators for expansion adult-specific challenges: work verification documentation, exemption application processes, employer coordination, episodic employment patterns, and intersection of health barriers with work requirements. Generic Medicaid application assistance isn't sufficient.

### Community-Based Infrastructure

Community-based infrastructure positions navigation services where expansion adults access other support: community health centers, food banks, housing assistance organizations, workforce development programs. These touchpoints serve expansion populations specifically rather than all Medicaid beneficiaries generally.

## Technology Coordination Across Stakeholders

The technology challenge isn't individual systems. It's integration enabling coordination across stakeholders serving expansion adults. State eligibility systems, MCO care coordination platforms, employer verification networks, provider documentation portals, and community navigator tools must share data appropriately.

API standards enable automated data flow between systems. State-to-MCO data sharing provides care coordinators with member renewal status. Employer-to-state verification submission enables real-time processing. Provider-to-state exemption documentation bypasses mail delays. Navigator-to-state application assistance ensures complete submissions.

The timeline is brutal. Developing API specifications takes months. Implementation and testing add more time. Security requirements for health data intensify complexity. Most sophisticated integration won't be ready for January 2027. Basic capability must launch with enhancement over time based on what actually serves expansion adult populations effectively.

## The Market Dynamics

MCOs, providers, employers, and community organizations make infrastructure investment decisions based on market realities. Organizations serving high proportions of expansion adults must invest substantially. Organizations serving primarily other populations invest minimally.

This market segmentation may drive consolidation. MCOs may optimize portfolios for specific populationsâ€”some specializing in expansion adults with sophisticated work requirement infrastructure, others focusing on children or elderly with simpler systems. Provider networks may differentiate similarly. The Medicaid managed care market has always been heterogeneous. Semi-annual expansion adult cycles intensify that heterogeneity.

States must recognize this reality in rate setting. Plans serving 80 percent expansion adults cannot operate on rates designed for plans serving 20 percent expansion adults. The administrative cost differential is substantial and legitimate.

## What Success Looks Like

Success means expansion adults experience semi-annual redetermination as routine administrative process rather than recurring crisis. Renewal notices arrive with clear instructions. Documentation verification happens automatically when possible. Exemption renewals integrate with clinical care. Appeals proceed rapidly when determinations are incorrect.

Success means vulnerable expansion adults receive intensive support preventing coverage loss. Care coordinators identify high-risk members proactively. Peer navigators assist with documentation barriers. Providers facilitate exemption renewals during appointments. Community organizations connect people to resources enabling compliance.

Success means other Medicaid populations experience minimal disruption from expansion adult infrastructure changes. Children, elderly, and disabled populations on annual cycles don't get confused by communications about semi-annual cycles that don't apply to them. Systems handle multiple population types without processing errors.

## What Failure Looks Like

Failure means expansion adults cycling through repeated coverage loss. Renewal deadlines arrive without adequate support. Documentation requirements exceed capacity. Exemption applications languish. Appeals take months. Coverage gaps interrupt care. Health deteriorates. Emergency utilization increases. The system optimizes for average cases while vulnerable expansion populations experience systematic failure.

Failure means stakeholders building misaligned infrastructure. States create eligibility systems without MCO integration points. MCOs develop care coordinator tools without employer verification access. Providers submit documentation through channels states don't monitor. Community navigators use systems disconnected from state processing. Everyone builds something but nothing coordinates effectively.

Failure means market exits. MCOs serving high proportions of expansion adults cannot sustain operations on inadequate rates and exit those markets. Safety-net providers overwhelmed by documentation burden stop accepting new Medicaid expansion patients. Community organizations lacking sustainable funding close navigation programs. The infrastructure doesn't exist because the market can't support it.

## The Fourteen-Month Reality

Fourteen months until January 2027. States need RFPs issued by early 2026 for vendor solutions. MCOs need actuarial analysis complete by March 2026 for rate negotiations. Employers need engagement beginning immediately for partnership development. Providers need portal access and training by mid-2026. Community organizations need funding secured and staff trained by fall 2026.

Every month of delay compounds the challenge. The perfect is the enemy of the functional. States must deploy minimum viable systems at launch for expansion adults with enhancement over time. MCOs must start with basic capabilities and build sophistication through iteration. Employers must commit to partnership even before perfect processes exist. Providers must participate despite imperfect integration. Community organizations must operate despite incomplete funding.

The alternative is chaos. Eighteen point five million expansion adults entering semi-annual cycles without adequate infrastructure means predictable mass coverage loss. The health consequences will be substantial. The system costs from emergency utilization will exceed what maintaining coverage would have cost. The human cost will be immeasurable.

Building what's needed requires commitment from everyone with authority to build something. States can't do this alone. MCOs can't coordinate across populations without state partnership. Employers won't verify without clear processes. Providers won't document without sustainable support. Community organizations can't scale without funding. Success requires aligned infrastructure across stakeholders specifically serving expansion adult populations. Fourteen months to build it. The clock is running.
