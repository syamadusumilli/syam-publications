# What We Owe and What We Build
## A Manifesto on Medicaid Work Requirements and the Infrastructure of Mutual Obligation

In ten months, the largest transformation of American social policy since welfare reform will begin. Starting December 2026, approximately 18.5 million Medicaid expansion adults must document 80 hours monthly of work, education, training, or qualifying activities to maintain healthcare coverage. Semi-annual redetermination cycles will verify compliance. Those who cannot demonstrate qualifying activity, or cannot prove exemption from the requirement, will lose coverage.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act settled the political question. Work requirements are law. What the law did not settle is the implementation question: whether this transformation will function as a recognition system that identifies people already meeting expectations, or a compliance system that catches people failing to prove it. That architectural choice will determine whether millions of Americans keep the healthcare coverage they need to stay employed, or lose it because they could not navigate paperwork designed without understanding their lives.

This series exists because that implementation question has received almost no serious analytical attention.

## The Finding That Reframes Everything

The conventional framing of work requirements treats the policy as an employment incentive. People receiving Medicaid should work. Requirements create the expectation. Compliance rates measure whether people respond. Coverage losses represent the cost of non-participation.

The evidence tells a different story. Arkansas implemented Medicaid work requirements in 2018, the only state to do so before courts intervened. In ten months, 18,164 people lost coverage. Research conducted after implementation found that approximately 95 percent of those who lost coverage were already working or qualified for exemptions. They did not fail to work. They failed to prove they were working.

This single finding reframes the entire policy challenge. If coverage losses primarily reflect documentation failure rather than behavioral failure, then work requirements are not principally an employment program. They are an administrative infrastructure program. The question is not how to motivate people to work. The question is how to build verification systems, exemption processes, navigation networks, and coordination mechanisms capable of recognizing compliance that already exists.

The distinction has practical consequences. An employment program invests in job training, placement services, and labor market access. An administrative infrastructure program invests in data integration, employer verification systems, community navigation capacity, and exemption processing workflows. Confusing the two means building the wrong systems, investing in the wrong capacities, and measuring success against the wrong benchmarks.

## Compliance Systems and Recognition Systems

Every state implementing work requirements faces a foundational design choice that is rarely made explicitly but determines everything that follows.

A compliance system starts from the assumption that members are non-compliant until proven otherwise. It places the documentation burden on individuals. It requires monthly or semi-annual self-reporting through portals, paper forms, or phone systems. It treats missed deadlines as evidence of non-participation. It measures success by the percentage of members who submit complete verification packages on time. In a compliance system, the state waits for proof. Silence means failure.

A recognition system starts from the assumption that most members are already doing what the policy requires and designs infrastructure to confirm it. It uses payroll data matching to automatically verify W-2 employment. It cross-references educational enrollment databases. It identifies probable exemptions through clinical records already in MCO systems. It reserves human-intensive verification for cases that automated systems cannot resolve. In a recognition system, the state actively looks for compliance. Silence triggers outreach, not termination.

The difference is not philosophical. It is operational. A compliance system requires 18.5 million people to individually navigate reporting processes every six months. A recognition system requires investment in data infrastructure that verifies compliance for the majority automatically and concentrates navigation resources on the complex minority.

Arkansas built a compliance system. It required members to log hours through an online portal that many could not access, during reporting windows many did not understand, with documentation many could not produce. The result was 18,164 coverage terminations in ten months, overwhelmingly among people who were working or exempt.

Ohio is building something closer to a recognition system. Its data matching infrastructure cross-references Medicaid enrollment against unemployment insurance wage records, automatically verifying employment for members whose hours appear in state databases. The system still cannot reach cash economy workers, gig employees outside payroll systems, or people whose qualifying activities do not generate digital records. But it eliminates the documentation burden for the majority of the expansion population and concentrates caseworker time on people who actually need help.

The choice between these architectures is not binary. Every state will build some hybrid. But the default orientation matters. Systems designed primarily to catch non-compliance will produce coverage losses among compliant people. Systems designed primarily to recognize compliance will retain coverage for people already meeting requirements while identifying the smaller population that genuinely needs support or intervention.

Georgia's Pathways to Coverage program illustrates the stakes. The program enrolled roughly 5,500 people against projections of 25,000 eligible. Even with relatively minimal reporting requirements, the target population could not reliably navigate the system. The state's waiver extension proposal now eliminates monthly reporting in favor of annual verification, a tacit admission that the compliance architecture was producing failure, not accountability.

## The Coordination Problem Nobody Owns

Work requirements sound simple: verify that people are working 80 hours a month. In practice, they require coordination across institutions that have never worked together at this scale or speed.

States must build eligibility systems, define exemption categories, establish reporting standards, and manage the volume of processing 18.5 million determinations twice yearly on top of 71.5 million annual determinations already straining capacity. MCOs must integrate compliance support into care coordination, manage actuarial volatility as enrollment fluctuates, and protect risk adjustment scores that degrade when members churn in and out of coverage. Employers must verify hours for workers who hold multiple part-time jobs, work gig arrangements, or earn wages in cash economies that produce no records. Providers must attest to medical conditions qualifying for exemptions without reimbursement for the time required or guidance on how to do it consistently. Community organizations must help people navigate systems that did not exist twelve months ago with funding that has not been established. Educational institutions must verify enrollment without infrastructure connecting them to Medicaid eligibility systems.

No single entity owns this problem. States have authority but limited operational capacity. MCOs have operational capacity but limited authority over upstream systems. Employers have data but no obligation to share it. Providers have clinical knowledge but no mandate to translate it into administrative attestation. Community organizations have trust but not scale. This is a distributed implementation problem with no natural coordinator and no precedent for the cross-sector alignment required.

The closest analogy is the Medicaid unwinding of 2023-2024, when the end of continuous enrollment protections required states to redetermine eligibility for their entire populations. States with strong data infrastructure and proactive outreach retained coverage for eligible members. States with weak systems and passive approaches lost millions of enrollees who remained eligible but could not navigate administrative processes. Work requirements layer additional complexity onto systems that struggled with the simpler task of annual redetermination.

## What This Series Does

Over twelve weeks, this analytical series examined every dimension of work requirement implementation across more than 180 articles organized in 18 thematic series. The ambition was comprehensive: not to advocate for or against work requirements, but to map the full terrain of what implementation requires, who it affects, and where the failure modes hide.

Series 1 through 3 establish the philosophical foundations and stakeholder landscape. Work requirements can be understood through conservative frameworks emphasizing dignity through contribution, progressive frameworks emphasizing rights without preconditions, or communitarian frameworks seeking balance between expectation and accommodation. The implementation challenges exist regardless of which framework motivates the policy. These pieces bracket the normative question deliberately.

Series 4 through 6 examine technology infrastructure, employer dynamics, and dual eligible populations. Verification systems, exemption workflows, data integration, and member portals must be built within timelines that compress years of normal procurement into months. Employer engagement proves more complex than assumed, particularly for small businesses, gig platforms, and cash-economy operations. Dual eligibles face overlapping requirements from programs with different rules, different agencies, and different expectations.

Series 7 addresses rulemaking architecture: the hundreds of decisions states must make about exemption categories, verification standards, timing rules, and delegated authority before a single member faces a compliance determination. These decisions, made in administrative proceedings attracting little public attention, will shape outcomes more than the legislation itself.

Series 8 and 9 map community organization and provider landscapes, revealing infrastructure gaps that threaten implementation. Faith-based organizations, grant-funded CBOs, social enterprises, mutual aid networks, and volunteer systems each offer partial capacity that must be coordinated into functioning navigation networks. Provider attestation for medical exemptions requires clinical workflows, liability frameworks, and reimbursement structures that do not yet exist at scale.

Series 10 examines educational institutions from universities to GED programs to vocational training, analyzing how education qualifies as a compliance pathway and what verification infrastructure is needed across fragmented institutional landscapes.

Series 11 is the heart of the human dimension. Nineteen articles examine populations facing intersecting barriers: pregnant and postpartum women, people with serious mental illness, those in substance use recovery, justice-involved individuals, people experiencing homelessness, caregivers, those in life transitions, domestic violence survivors, people in geographic and digital isolation, those with limited English proficiency, people with disabilities not qualifying for SSI/SSDI, veterans, LGBTQ+ individuals, those with complex medical conditions, foster care alumni, agricultural workers, structurally locked-out populations, and communities in post-industrial regions. A twentieth article examines intersectionality, because these barriers almost always compound.

Series 12 and 13 address economics and cross-cutting implementation challenges: navigation investment returns, activity credit frameworks, the financial cliff facing people who lose coverage December 31st, retention paradoxes, documentation gaps, behavioral economics of compliance, fraud prevention, and the technology vendor landscape.

Series 14 profiles implementation readiness across all 50 states and the District of Columbia. What works in Ohio's automated data-matching environment will not work in Mississippi's paper-based county systems. What California faces with 5 million expansion adults and simultaneous policy collisions bears no resemblance to Wyoming's challenge with 8,000.

Series 15 and 16 bring interdisciplinary perspectives from psychology, behavioral science, social work, sociology, philosophy, history, geography, and political science. Allostatic load. Executive function paradoxes. Caseworker discretion. Bureaucratic inequality. The spatial politics of compliance. Media framing. Litigation strategies.

Series 17 and 18 examine structural policy and financial exposure: risk adjustment models, ACO dynamics, federal-state financing, and what MCOs and health systems stand to lose when coverage churn accelerates.

## The Thesis

Across all of this analysis, a single thesis emerges:

Work requirements will function as documentation requirements. Documentation requirements will function as administrative burden. Administrative burden will concentrate on the populations least equipped to bear it. And the resulting coverage losses will fall overwhelmingly on people who are already doing what the policy asks them to do.

This is not ideology. It is an inference from the only empirical evidence available, combined with structural analysis of the systems being built. Arkansas proved the pattern. Georgia confirmed that even minimal reporting requirements create barriers the target population cannot reliably navigate. The unwinding demonstrated that administrative processes optimized for institutional efficiency rather than human capacity produce coverage losses among eligible populations.

Nothing in the current implementation trajectory suggests different results at national scale.

But the thesis carries a constructive corollary. If documentation failure rather than behavioral failure is the primary risk, then documentation infrastructure is the primary solution. Recognition systems that use data matching to verify employment through payroll records. Presumptive compliance for populations with demonstrated high work rates. Proactive exemption identification using clinical data already in MCO systems. Navigation networks that help people prove what they are already doing. These approaches serve the policy's stated goals better than compliance architectures that maximize documentation demands on populations unable to meet them.

The question is whether states and their implementation partners will build recognition systems or compliance systems. The answer will determine outcomes for 18.5 million people.

## Why This Work Exists

This series was written from a position of deliberate philosophical neutrality. The analysis does not argue that work requirements are good policy or bad policy. It argues that they are complex policy, that complexity creates implementation risk, and that implementation risk can be managed through informed design or left to produce foreseeable harm through neglect.

The neutrality is not indifference. Behind every data point are people whose healthcare coverage depends on systems that do not yet exist, administered by institutions that have never coordinated at this scale, evaluated against standards that have not been written, with consequences that cannot be reversed once they occur. A person who loses Medicaid coverage because they could not navigate an employer verification portal does not get retrospective coverage for the months they went without insulin. The health consequences of administrative failure are not administrative.

The intended audience is everyone with a role in building these systems: state Medicaid directors making rulemaking decisions, MCO executives designing member support programs, community organization leaders positioning for navigation contracts, provider groups developing attestation workflows, employer associations creating verification infrastructure, technology vendors building platforms, and policymakers evaluating whether the systems being constructed will achieve the outcomes the policy intends.

Ten months remain before December 2026. The infrastructure of mutual obligation is either being built right now or it is not. This series is an attempt to ensure that those building it understand what they are building, who it affects, and what is at stake if they get it wrong.
