# Article 18D: Medicaid ACO Financial Exposure Analysis

## Work Requirements and the Unraveling of Value-Based Care Economics

**Series 18: Financial Exposure and Strategic Response**

## Opening Narrative

The chief medical officer at a large Coordinated Care Organization in Oregon stares at the actuarial projections her finance team delivered that morning. The numbers describe a familiar problem through an unfamiliar lens. Federal work requirements effective December 2026 will affect approximately 520,000 expansion adults across Oregon's CCO network. Her organization serves roughly 185,000 of them. These are not marginal members generating minimal revenue. These are precisely the members her CCO has invested most heavily in over the past five years: the patients with diabetes who finally achieved A1C control after eighteen months of care management, the individuals with serious mental illness whose medication adherence required weekly care coordinator contact, the members recovering from substance use disorder who are six months into successful treatment.

The spreadsheet before her contains conventional projections. Expected coverage losses of 15 to 20 percent. Premium revenue reduction of $84 million annually. Global budget adjustment implications. The numbers look concerning but manageable. Her CFO has prepared talking points for the board emphasizing the organization's strong reserve position.

What the spreadsheet fails to capture is everything that happens after a member loses coverage. Maria, 47, works seasonally in agricultural processing. She has type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and depression. The CCO's disease management program spent eighteen months achieving her current stability. When Maria loses coverage in March because her winter work hours fell below 80 monthly, the investment evaporates. When she returns in September after demonstrating spring and summer employment, her conditions have deteriorated during six months without medication access. The CCO must restart from a worse baseline while bearing immediate costs that exceed Maria's inadequate returning risk score.

The CMO understands something her spreadsheet does not quantify: **value-based care economics require enrollment stability that work requirements destroy**. The three-year investment horizon that justified prevention spending, behavioral health integration, and community health worker programs assumed members would remain attributed long enough for returns to materialize. Semi-annual redetermination cycles compress that horizon below the threshold where most upstream investments break even.

## Why Revenue Loss Calculations Fail for ACOs

### The Conventional Approach and Its Fundamental Error

Most early analyses of ACO financial exposure from work requirements follow straightforward methodology. Identify expansion adult attribution. Estimate percentage losing coverage due to compliance failures. Multiply by average per-member revenue. Some analysts then apply margin assumptions borrowed from MCO analysis, which represents a category error since ACO payment models do not operate on margin economics. Others attempt model-appropriate analysis but still miss the dominant exposure categories. Either approach generates numbers that create false comfort while missing the majority of actual financial impact.

The conventional calculation correctly recognizes that when members lose coverage permanently, the ACO no longer receives attribution payments and no longer bears financial responsibility for their care. Under certain payment models, this appears to create a wash. The ACO loses revenue but sheds associated costs.

This logic fails for ACOs in ways it does not fail for fee-for-service arrangements or even traditional managed care. ACO payment models reward investment in prevention, care coordination, and population health improvement. These investments require upfront spending that generates returns over time. When the invested population disappears mid-cycle, the ACO has incurred costs without opportunity for return. The economics differ fundamentally from arrangements where payments and costs flow in parallel.

### The Investment Loss Mechanism

Consider what actually happens when an ACO invests in a complex member who subsequently loses coverage. Roberto, 52, has poorly controlled diabetes, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and depression. His baseline risk profile at the start of the performance year projects healthcare costs of approximately $48,000 annually. The ACO assigns a nurse care manager, connects Roberto with a community health worker for food access support, schedules monthly primary care visits, and coordinates behavioral health integration for his depression.

Six months into the performance year, Roberto's care is improving. His A1C has dropped from 9.2 to 7.8. His blood pressure is approaching target. His depression is responding to medication and therapy. The ACO has invested approximately $6,000 in care coordination, care management, and community health worker support during these six months. The investment is generating returns visible in Roberto's improving metrics.

Roberto works as a delivery driver for a restaurant supply company. His hours fluctuate seasonally. During summer months when restaurants order heavily, he logs 100 hours weekly. During slow winter months, he sometimes drops to 60 hours. In January, his hours fall below the 80-hour monthly threshold. His employer provides limited documentation because driver hours vary by route assignment and tips constitute meaningful income. Roberto fails work requirement verification in March.

Here is where ACO economics diverge from conventional loss calculations. Roberto's care costs during his enrolled months totaled approximately $24,000 for medical services plus the $6,000 coordination investment. The ACO bore these costs. Roberto's projected full-year costs of $48,000 would have been partially offset by improvement from care management. Instead, Roberto disappears from attribution with six months of costs absorbed and no opportunity to capture the returns that would have materialized in subsequent quarters and years.

The **stranded investment** represents direct financial loss. The ACO spent $30,000 on Roberto's care through June. That spending is gone. Under shared savings models, there is no mechanism to recover investment in members who lose attribution mid-cycle. Under global budget models, the infrastructure supporting Roberto's care management remains fixed even as revenue declines with his departure.

### The Returning Member Problem Compounds Exposure

Roberto may return. After demonstrating adequate work hours during spring and summer, he re-enrolls in September. The ACO should be relieved to recover an attributed member. Instead, Roberto's return creates a different financial problem.

During his six-month coverage gap, Roberto could not afford his medications. His diabetes control deteriorated rapidly. His A1C rose to 10.4. His blood pressure elevation caused symptoms that sent him to an emergency department for an uninsured visit he cannot pay for. His depression worsened as his health destabilized.

Roberto's returning risk profile does not reflect his actual acuity. ACO risk adjustment models use twelve to twenty-four month lookback periods for diagnosis capture and severity scoring. Half of Roberto's lookback now consists of months without coverage and without documented care. His returning risk score suggests a moderately complex diabetic member. His actual presentation is a severely decompensated patient requiring intensive intervention.

The ACO faces what might be called **risk adjustment degradation**: systematic underpayment for members whose returning risk scores inadequately capture their current clinical needs. Roberto's risk score generates approximately $400 monthly in risk-adjusted payment. His actual care costs during restabilization will exceed $1,000 monthly. The ACO absorbs a $600 monthly shortfall that flows directly to the bottom line without any revenue offset.

This mismatch persists until new documentation accumulates to recapture lost diagnosis codes and severity indicators. If Roberto sees his primary care physician quarterly, it takes twelve months of consistent care to generate four encounters documenting his chronic conditions at their current severity. During those twelve months, the ACO absorbs systematic underpayment that accumulates to approximately $7,200 per complex returning member.

The risk adjustment degradation mechanism explains why comprehensive financial exposure substantially exceeds what conventional analysis captures. When thousands of complex members cycle through coverage gaps and return with inadequate risk scores, the aggregate underpayment during recapture periods dominates all other exposure components.

## The Seven-Component Framework for ACO Exposure

True financial impact from work requirements involves at least seven distinct components for ACOs, with the relative weight varying substantially based on payment model structure.

**Component 1: Direct Revenue Loss (Payment Model Dependent).** Members who permanently lose attribution no longer generate revenue. The net financial impact varies by payment model. Under global budgets, lost revenue has no associated cost offset because infrastructure costs remain fixed. Under shared savings, lost members represent investment without return opportunity. Under two-sided risk, permanent departures may actually reduce downside exposure for high-cost members while eliminating upside potential for improving members. This component does not follow simple margin mathematics for any ACO model.

**Component 2: Stranded Investment (Full Amount).** Care management programs, behavioral health integration, community health worker support, and chronic disease intervention represent sunk costs that evaporate when members lose coverage. Unlike MCOs that might reduce care management staffing in response to enrollment decline, ACOs build infrastructure for attributed populations that cannot be rapidly adjusted. The accumulated investment in relationship building, clinical improvement, and care coordination simply disappears when members lose attribution. This represents direct cost loss.

**Component 3: Risk Adjustment Degradation (Full Amount).** Members returning after coverage gaps present with degraded risk scores that inadequately capture their actual acuity. The underpayment gap between risk-adjusted payments and actual costs incurred flows directly to the bottom line. Conservative estimates suggest complex members returning after coverage gaps generate underpayment of $5,000 to $8,000 per member during twelve-month recapture periods. This component represents the largest source of exposure for ACOs with significant returning member populations.

**Component 4: Quality Measure Disruption (Full Amount).** ACO payment models tie substantial revenue to quality performance. Oregon CCOs face quality withholds of 2 to 4 percent. Massachusetts ACOs participate in quality bonus programs. Minnesota IHPs calculate shared savings based on quality performance. Coverage churn creates measurement problems: members who lose coverage mid-measurement period may be excluded from denominators entirely, potentially helping quality rates, but the prevention investments targeting those members represent stranded costs. Members who return with deteriorated conditions worsen quality metrics for the subsequent measurement period. The net quality impact depends on specific measure definitions and timing.

**Component 5: Global Budget Structural Mismatch (Global Budget Models Only).** Oregon CCOs and similar global budget arrangements receive fixed monthly payments based on attributed population. Infrastructure costs for care coordination, behavioral health integration, and community health improvement remain fixed regardless of enrollment fluctuation. When enrollment declines, per-member infrastructure costs rise as fixed costs spread across fewer members. This structural mismatch is unique to global budget models and represents exposure beyond direct revenue loss.

**Component 6: Shared Savings Calculation Distortion (Shared Savings Models Only).** ACOs receiving shared savings payments face complex year-end calculations comparing actual costs to benchmarks. Members who lose coverage mid-year after consuming significant healthcare resources count toward costs but not toward denominator calculations that determine benchmark adequacy. The arithmetic systematically disadvantages ACOs experiencing mid-year churn among high-cost members.

**Component 7: Two-Sided Risk Asymmetry (Two-Sided Risk Models Only).** ACOs bearing downside risk face asymmetric exposure. High-cost members who lose coverage early in the performance year leave the ACO holding their costs without opportunity to manage subsequent utilization. Improving members who lose coverage deprive the ACO of the savings their improving health would have generated. The distribution of which members lose coverage determines whether two-sided risk amplifies or partially offsets work requirements exposure.

### Framework Limitations

The seven-component framework represents analytical improvement over conventional revenue loss estimates but carries assumptions warranting acknowledgment.

**Component interaction** complicates summation. Stranded investment and risk adjustment degradation are not independent. Members with highest care management investment are often the same complex members whose coverage gaps generate greatest risk adjustment degradation. Counting both components risks partial double-counting.

**Behavioral responses** will reshape exposure over time. ACOs may develop navigation capabilities reducing churn among high-risk members. Providers may accelerate documentation for returning members, shortening recapture periods. Members may learn compliance requirements. These responses would reduce actual exposure below framework projections.

**State policy variation** affects multiple components. Redetermination procedures, exemption processes, and compliance verification methods vary by state in ways that affect overall churn rates and the distribution of which members lose coverage.

The framework's value lies in identifying exposure categories that conventional analysis ignores rather than generating precise predictions. Specific dollar figures should be understood as order-of-magnitude estimates informing strategic decisions rather than actuarial projections suitable for financial reporting.

## ACO Exposure by Payment Model Type

### Global Budget Models: Oregon CCOs

Oregon's sixteen Coordinated Care Organizations face the most concentrated financial exposure among ACO models. CCOs receive fixed monthly per-member payments covering physical, behavioral, and oral health services. They bear full financial risk for attributed populations. Infrastructure costs remain fixed regardless of enrollment fluctuation.

**Statewide Expansion Adult Attribution:** 520,000 members

**Conventional Analysis (Statewide):**

Global budget models do not operate on margin economics. CCOs receive fixed monthly payments and bear full risk for population costs. Conventional analysis would estimate impact as:

- Annual global budget revenue from expansion adults: $3.12 billion
- Revenue reduction (20% coverage loss): $624 million
- Infrastructure cost reallocation: CCO fixed costs (care coordination staff, behavioral health integration, community health workers, administrative systems) remain constant while spreading across 20% fewer members. If fixed costs represent 12-15% of global budget, per-member fixed cost burden rises by approximately 3-4%.
- Conventional estimate of financial strain: $94-125 million (infrastructure mismatch plus cash flow disruption)

This conventional approach still understates exposure because it treats member departure as simple revenue reduction rather than accounting for stranded investment and returning member economics.

**Comprehensive Seven-Component Analysis (Statewide Year 1):**
- Direct Revenue Loss: $62 million (10% permanent loss, infrastructure cost spread)
- Stranded Investment: $52 million (care management, community health workers)
- Risk Adjustment Degradation: $286 million (41,000 complex returners Ã— $7,000)
- Quality Measure Disruption: $31 million
- Global Budget Structural Mismatch: $47 million
- **Total Year 1 Impact: $478 million**
- **Stabilized Annual Impact: $312 million**

The comprehensive estimate exceeds even this more sophisticated conventional analysis by approximately four to five times. The gap exists because conventional analysis still misses the dominant category: risk adjustment degradation from returning members. Global budget structural mismatch represents an additional exposure category unique to this payment model.

**Individual CCO Exposure Ranges:**

Large CCOs (200,000+ total members): $45-65 million Year 1 exposure
Mid-size CCOs (100,000-200,000 members): $22-38 million Year 1 exposure
Smaller CCOs (<100,000 members): $8-18 million Year 1 exposure

CareOregon and Health Share of Oregon, serving the Portland metropolitan area with combined expansion adult attribution exceeding 200,000, face exposure comparable to mid-size MCOs nationally. Their global budget structure and prevention investment intensity amplify exposure relative to what enrollment scale alone would suggest.

### Two-Sided Risk Models: Massachusetts MassHealth ACOs

Massachusetts operates seventeen ACOs serving approximately 1.3 million members under two-sided risk arrangements. Accountable Care Partnership Plans integrate with MCO infrastructure while Primary Care ACOs maintain fee-for-service payment with retrospective shared savings calculations.

**Expansion Adult Attribution:** 255,000 members

**Conventional Analysis:**

Two-sided risk models operate on benchmark-relative economics, not margin percentages. ACOs share savings or losses compared to cost targets. Conventional analysis would estimate:

- Annual benchmark for expansion adult population: $1.53 billion
- Members losing coverage mid-year after consuming care: costs incurred count toward performance but members excluded from year-end attribution
- High-cost member asymmetry: if members with above-average costs disproportionately lose coverage early, ACO absorbs their costs without opportunity to manage subsequent utilization
- Foregone savings from improving members: members whose health was improving represent lost opportunity for benchmark outperformance
- Conventional estimate of benchmark calculation distortion: $45-65 million (depending on which members lose coverage and when)

**Comprehensive Seven-Component Analysis (Year 1):**
- Direct Revenue Loss: $27 million
- Stranded Investment: $25 million
- Risk Adjustment Degradation: $140 million (20,000 complex returners Ã— $7,000)
- Quality Measure Disruption: $15 million
- Two-Sided Risk Asymmetry: $35 million
- **Total Year 1 Impact: $242 million**
- **Stabilized Annual Impact: $158 million**

Massachusetts ACOs face exposure compounded by the state's ACO Quality and Equity Incentive Program. Substantial bonus payments tied to health equity performance require longitudinal data demonstrating improvement over time. Members churning in and out of coverage generate incomplete data trails potentially excluding ACOs from equity bonuses despite genuine intervention effort.

### Shared Savings Models: Minnesota IHPs

Minnesota's Integrated Health Partnerships program illustrates pure shared savings arrangements without downside risk. Twenty-five organizations cover more than 505,000 beneficiaries with emphasis on care coordination and social determinants.

**Expansion Adult Attribution:** 195,000 members

**Conventional Analysis:**

Shared savings models are upside-only arrangements. ACOs share in savings if costs fall below benchmarks but face no downside risk if costs exceed targets. Conventional analysis would estimate:

- Annual benchmark for expansion adult population: $1.17 billion
- Historical shared savings rate: Minnesota IHPs saved $156 million across all populations over three years, suggesting approximately 4-5% savings generation when populations remain stable
- Expansion adult contribution to savings potential: approximately $47-58 million annually under stable enrollment
- Coverage churn impact on savings potential: 17% member loss eliminates savings opportunity from departed members while potentially concentrating higher-cost members in remaining population
- Conventional estimate of foregone savings: $15-22 million (lost opportunity, not loss of existing revenue)

This conventional approach understates exposure because it ignores stranded care coordination investment in members who disappear mid-year.

**Comprehensive Seven-Component Analysis (Year 1):**
- Direct Revenue Loss: $20 million (opportunity cost of lost savings potential)
- Stranded Investment: $19 million
- Risk Adjustment Degradation: $107 million (15,300 complex returners Ã— $7,000)
- Quality Measure Disruption: $12 million
- Shared Savings Calculation Distortion: $18 million
- **Total Year 1 Impact: $176 million**
- **Stabilized Annual Impact: $115 million**

Minnesota IHPs appear less vulnerable because they face no downside risk if costs exceed benchmarks. However, shared savings models depend on member stability for investment return. The program saved $156 million in its first three years through sustained care coordination with complex populations over multi-year periods. Work requirements that cause 15-20% of complex members to churn annually would fundamentally alter the economics underlying that success.

### Regional Accountable Entities: Colorado RAEs

Colorado's seven Regional Accountable Entities emphasize behavioral health integration under performance-based payment arrangements that fall between global budgets and pure shared savings.

**Expansion Adult Attribution:** 450,000 members

**Conventional Analysis:**

RAEs operate under performance-based arrangements emphasizing behavioral health integration, falling between global budgets and pure shared savings. Payment combines administrative PMPM, performance incentives, and risk corridor protections. Conventional analysis would estimate:

- Annual performance-based payments for expansion adults: $2.7 billion
- Administrative PMPM portion at risk from enrollment decline: approximately $180 million (assuming 20% coverage loss)
- Performance incentive exposure: behavioral health quality measures require longitudinal data; coverage churn disrupts measurement, potentially reducing incentive attainment by 15-25%
- Behavioral health integration investment at risk: RAEs have built SMI and SUD care coordination specifically for expansion populations
- Conventional estimate of financial impact: $65-85 million (administrative payment loss plus performance incentive reduction)

**Comprehensive Seven-Component Analysis (Year 1):**
- Direct Revenue Loss: $54 million
- Stranded Investment: $45 million
- Risk Adjustment Degradation: $248 million (35,400 complex returners Ã— $7,000)
- Quality Measure Disruption: $27 million
- Behavioral Health Integration Loss: $38 million
- **Total Year 1 Impact: $412 million**
- **Stabilized Annual Impact: $268 million**

RAE structure creates particular work requirement vulnerabilities around behavioral health populations. Serious mental illness and substance use disorder represent the most common exemption categories but also the populations facing greatest documentation difficulty. Colorado's geographic RAE model means entities cannot diversify away from expansion adult populations as each serves a defined region where expansion adults constitute significant membership percentage.

## State-Specific Complexity: California and Beyond

### California: Multi-Model Convergence

California operates perhaps the most complex Medicaid delivery system in the nation, with Medi-Cal managed care plans coexisting alongside Accountable Care Organizations, Federally Qualified Health Centers, and provider-sponsored arrangements that blur traditional boundaries.

The state's 2025 rate certification introduced quality withhold structures and directed payment mechanisms that create ACO-like risk arrangements even within the MCO framework. County Organized Health Systems in particular operate with characteristics of both managed care and accountable care. CalOptima in Orange County and Central California Alliance for Health function as single-plan entities bearing population health risk that resembles global budget arrangements.

California's simultaneous policy pressures compound ACO exposure. State restrictions on undocumented coverage affect populations that many safety-net oriented ACOs serve through CHC partnerships. Asset limit reinstatement creates administrative burden affecting aged and disabled populations attributed to ACOs emphasizing complex care management. The convergence of federal work requirements with state benefit restrictions creates cumulative exposure that single-policy analysis understates.

Medi-Cal ACOs operating under the state's Comprehensive Quality Strategy face quality withhold exposure of 3 to 4 percent of capitation. Semi-annual redetermination cycles will disrupt quality measure denominators in ways the current measurement methodology does not accommodate. ACOs may find their quality performance artificially depressed by enrollment volatility rather than actual care delivery problems.

**California-Specific Exposure Estimate:**

For the approximately 380,000 expansion adults attributed to ACO or ACO-like arrangements in California:

- Year 1 Comprehensive Exposure: $295-315 million
- Stabilized Annual Exposure: $190-210 million

This estimate incorporates California's higher average acuity, more aggressive quality withhold structure, and the compounding effect of simultaneous state policy changes.

### New Jersey: Three-Party Complexity

New Jersey's demonstration program serves approximately 400,000 members through twelve organizations using a three-party structure where the state contracts with MCOs that then delegate to ACOs. This intermediary layer adds complexity for navigation service delivery while partially buffering ACOs from direct financial exposure.

The delegation structure means ACOs bear clinical risk but may be partially insulated from enrollment volatility depending on contract terms. However, the MCO intermediary creates coordination challenges for compliance support. Members receiving navigation assistance must navigate relationships with both MCO and ACO, potentially unclear about which entity is responsible for which functions.

**New Jersey-Specific Exposure Estimate:**

For the approximately 180,000 expansion adults in ACO arrangements:

- Year 1 Comprehensive Exposure: $98-115 million (partially buffered by MCO layer)
- Stabilized Annual Exposure: $65-78 million

### Vermont: All-Payer Integration

Vermont's OneCare Vermont operates a unique all-payer ACO integrating Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial populations under a single global budget framework. Approximately 55,000 expansion adults participate through the Medicaid component.

The all-payer structure provides cushion against Medicaid-specific enrollment volatility because care coordination infrastructure serves multiple payer populations. However, OneCare has invested specifically in Medicaid behavioral health integration that serves primarily expansion adult populations. Work requirements will affect the Medicaid component disproportionately relative to the Medicare population that provides OneCare's revenue stability.

**Vermont-Specific Exposure Estimate:**

- Year 1 Comprehensive Exposure: $32-38 million
- Stabilized Annual Exposure: $21-26 million

### Rhode Island: Scale Constraints

Rhode Island's three Accountable Entities cover 180,000 total members under shared savings arrangements emphasizing behavioral health integration. The small state provides opportunity for comprehensive statewide approach but limited revenue scale constrains investment capacity.

**Rhode Island-Specific Exposure Estimate:**

For the approximately 70,000 expansion adults:

- Year 1 Comprehensive Exposure: $38-45 million
- Stabilized Annual Exposure: $25-30 million

### Washington: Integrated Managed Care Transition

Washington has transitioned to fully integrated managed care combining physical and behavioral health under MCO arrangements. The state does not operate formal ACO programs, but several regional arrangements function with ACO-like characteristics. Approximately 620,000 expansion adults face work requirements across the state's managed care system.

The fully integrated model means behavioral health populations are not carved out but rather included in comprehensive managed care. This structure could facilitate coordinated compliance support for members with serious mental illness who qualify for exemptions but may struggle with documentation.

## Aggregate ACO Sector Exposure

Across all states operating Medicaid ACO or ACO-like programs, approximately 2.4 million expansion adults face work requirements under value-based payment arrangements.

**Nationwide ACO Sector Exposure Summary:**

| Model Type | Expansion Adults | Year 1 Exposure | Stabilized Annual |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Global Budget (OR, VT) | 575,000 | $510M | $335M |
| Two-Sided Risk (MA, NJ) | 435,000 | $340M | $225M |
| Shared Savings (MN) | 195,000 | $176M | $115M |
| RAEs/Hybrid (CO, others) | 680,000 | $545M | $355M |
| California ACO/ACO-like | 380,000 | $305M | $200M |
| Other States | 135,000 | $95M | $65M |
| **Total** | **2,400,000** | **$1.97B** | **$1.30B** |

The aggregate Year 1 exposure of approximately **$2 billion** represents a fundamental challenge to the Medicaid ACO sector. Stabilized annual exposure of $1.3 billion would persist indefinitely as long as work requirements generate enrollment churn among complex populations.

Properly constructed conventional analysis accounting for each model's actual economics would estimate sector exposure at approximately **$220-300 million**. The comprehensive seven-component framework reveals actual exposure exceeding even these more sophisticated conventional estimates by **six to nine times**. The gap exists because conventional analysis, even when model-appropriate, still misses the dominant exposure category: risk adjustment degradation from returning members whose inadequate risk scores create systematic underpayment during twelve-month recapture periods.

## Exposure Concentration: Clinical Complexity and Special Populations

### The Mathematics of Risk Adjustment Degradation

Risk adjustment degradation requires having documented risk to lose. This creates a distribution of exposure that concentrates heavily among clinically complex populations while leaving healthier members as relatively minor contributors to aggregate ACO financial impact.

A healthy 32-year-old with no chronic conditions carries a risk score near the floor of the adjustment model. Their baseline capitation might be $250 monthly, reflecting minimal expected healthcare utilization. If this member loses coverage for six months and returns, their score was already minimal. The underpayment gap between their returning score and actual restabilization costs might be $50-100 monthly. Multiplied across thousands of healthy members, this exposure matters but does not dominate.

A 48-year-old with diabetes, hypertension, depression, and early chronic kidney disease carries a risk score reflecting four to six captured Hierarchical Condition Categories. Their baseline capitation might be $870 monthly, reflecting documented chronic disease burden. Six months without coverage means six months without encounters documenting those conditions. Half of the lookback period now contains no diagnostic evidence. Their returning score might reflect one to two HCCs instead of five or six. The underpayment gap could reach $500-700 monthly and persist for twelve or more months until new documentation accumulates. That arithmetic produces the $5,000-8,000 per complex returner estimates that drive aggregate exposure calculations.

### Distribution Across Clinical Tiers

The distribution of risk adjustment degradation exposure follows clinical complexity in a pattern that concentrates financial impact among a minority of returning members:

**Top 15% by Clinical Complexity:** Members with multiple chronic conditions, serious mental illness, substance use disorders, and complex medical needs generate approximately 60-70% of total risk adjustment degradation exposure. These members carry risk scores of $600+ monthly and face deterioration trajectories during coverage gaps that amplify the gap between returning scores and actual acuity.

**Middle 35% with Moderate Chronic Disease:** Members with single chronic conditions or well-controlled multiple conditions generate approximately 25-30% of exposure. Their risk scores range from $350-600 monthly, and their conditions may worsen during gaps but typically do not deteriorate as dramatically as complex cases.

**Bottom 50% with Minimal Clinical Burden:** Healthy members or those with minor conditions generate only 5-10% of total risk adjustment degradation exposure. Their low baseline scores mean limited degradation potential regardless of gap duration.

This distribution has profound implications for navigation investment strategy. Spreading compliance support evenly across all expansion adults allocates resources to the bottom 50% of exposure while underserving the top 15% where financial impact concentrates.

### The Special Population Intersection

The populations most vulnerable to compliance failure substantially overlap with the populations generating greatest risk adjustment degradation exposure. This intersection creates both targeting clarity and ethical complexity.

**Serious Mental Illness:** Members with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or severe depression carry substantial psychiatric HCCs when engaged in treatment. They also face the highest rates of compliance failure because the cognitive and executive function challenges accompanying their conditions impede documentation assembly, deadline tracking, and bureaucratic navigation. A member whose paranoid ideation makes them distrust government communication may qualify for medical exemption but cannot process the exemption application precisely because of the symptoms that qualify them. When they eventually return to coverage, their psychiatric HCCs have degraded and their physical health comorbidities, which are common in SMI populations, have worsened during months without coordinated care.

**Substance Use Disorder:** Members in treatment for opioid use disorder, alcohol dependence, or other SUDs generate risk scores reflecting their conditions and frequently co-occurring chronic diseases. Recovery requires stability that work requirements disrupt. A member six months into successful medication-assisted treatment who loses coverage due to documentation failure faces relapse risk during their gap. When they return, they may present with active use, overdose history, or infectious disease complications that exceed their returning risk score by substantial margins.

**Complex Medical Conditions:** Members managing diabetes with complications, heart failure, COPD, or multiple interacting chronic diseases generate the highest risk-adjusted payments and face the steepest deterioration curves during coverage gaps. Medication non-adherence during uninsured months produces A1C spikes, blood pressure elevation, fluid retention, and respiratory decompensation that may require hospitalization upon return. These members often qualify for medical exemptions but face documentation burden during periods when their conditions are destabilizing.

**Justice-Involved Populations:** Members returning from incarceration frequently carry undiagnosed or undertreated chronic conditions that generate risk scores only after sustained engagement with primary care. They face employment instability, documentation barriers, and system navigation challenges that predict compliance failure. When they cycle through coverage gaps, their nascent care relationships dissolve before risk scores capture their actual complexity.

**Intersectional Burden:** Members facing multiple barriers compound these patterns. A member with serious mental illness, housing instability, and a recent incarceration history faces overlapping challenges that predict both high clinical risk and high compliance failure probability. These multiply-burdened members generate the most extreme risk adjustment degradation exposure while being least equipped to navigate compliance requirements independently.

### The Targeting Calculus

The mathematics create a targeting calculus that is ethically complicated but financially unambiguous. Navigation investment generates highest return when concentrated on members who are simultaneously clinically complex, at high risk of compliance failure, and likely to return rather than permanently disenroll.

The financially optimal targeting profile:

**High baseline risk score** (substantial HCCs to lose during gap)
**Unstable employment pattern** (seasonal work, gig economy, variable hours)
**Documentation barriers** (limited employer cooperation, informal work, cash economy)
**High return probability** (community ties, ongoing treatment relationships, family in area)
**Condition trajectory sensitivity** (medications that cannot be interrupted, conditions that deteriorate rapidly without management)

Members matching this profile might justify navigation investment of $500-800 per member when their risk adjustment degradation exposure exceeds $7,000. The 9:1 to 14:1 return on investment supports intensive intervention including proactive outreach, documentation assembly assistance, employer verification support, and exemption application preparation.

The ethical dimension deserves direct acknowledgment. Prioritizing navigation investment based on financial return means concentrating resources on clinically complex populations while providing less intensive support to healthier members. This creates a framework where the sickest members receive the most help, but for reasons grounded in ACO economics rather than clinical need or social justice.

Whether this alignment between financial incentive and clinical vulnerability represents fortuitous convergence or morally compromised reasoning depends on one's ethical framework. What remains clear is that the mathematics point in the same direction regardless of motivation: the members most worth saving financially are also the members most harmed by coverage disruption.

### Implications for Population Health Strategy

ACOs that have built their clinical programs around complex care management and special population services face a strategic question about how work requirements reshape their target populations.

Clinical programs for SMI, SUD, and complex chronic disease populations represent substantial ACO investment. These programs often serve expansion adults disproportionately because the ACA coverage expansion brought previously uninsured individuals with significant unmet health needs into the Medicaid system. Work requirements now threaten to remove precisely the populations these programs were built to serve.

Two strategic responses emerge:

**Intensive Retention:** Invest heavily in compliance navigation for complex populations, treating coverage retention as precondition for clinical program effectiveness. This approach accepts higher per-member spending on navigation for populations generating highest clinical and financial value.

**Portfolio Rebalancing:** Shift clinical investment toward populations with lower compliance failure risk, accepting that complex populations will churn at rates making sustained intervention impractical. This approach optimizes for population stability over population complexity.

The first response preserves ACO clinical mission but requires navigation capability ACOs typically lack. The second response abandons the populations ACOs were designed to serve while pursuing financial sustainability.

Most ACOs will likely land somewhere between these poles, attempting partial retention of complex populations while acknowledging that some coverage churn is inevitable. The gap between these strategic choices and optimal navigation investment creates the market opportunity for specialized compliance support services.

## Strategic Implications

### For ACO Leadership

The comprehensive framework fundamentally reframes where ACOs should concentrate intervention resources. The dominant exposure component is risk adjustment degradation from returning members whose risk scores inadequately capture their actual acuity. Prevention investment should concentrate on complex members with significant care management investment and high risk scores rather than spreading navigation support across all expansion adults equally.

**Member stratification** becomes essential. ACOs should identify members whose coverage loss would generate the largest stranded investment and risk adjustment degradation exposure. These members require intensive compliance support that may justify significant per-member investment. A $500 investment in navigation for a member generating $7,000 in potential risk adjustment degradation represents 14:1 return on investment.

ACOs should consider whether internal capacity exists to deliver compliance navigation or whether specialized external partners better serve this function. Care coordinators and care managers excel at clinical care coordination and social determinants intervention. Compliance navigation requires different skills, different systems, and different community relationships. Attempting to layer compliance support onto existing clinical staff may produce inadequate results while distracting from clinical mission.

### For State Medicaid Agencies

States operating ACO programs should recognize that work requirements create asymmetric damage to value-based arrangements compared to traditional fee-for-service or managed care. ACOs that have invested most heavily in prevention and population health improvement face greatest financial exposure because they have the most stranded investment at risk.

Rate-setting methodologies should account for returning member acuity that risk scores will not capture during recapture periods. States could implement supplemental payments for ACOs demonstrating high proportions of returning members with complex needs. Quality measure specifications may require modification to account for policy-induced enrollment volatility that current methodologies treat as random variation.

The fundamental question is whether states want ACO models to survive work requirements implementation. If value-based care represents preferred delivery system evolution, states must actively protect ACO economics from work requirements damage. Absent such protection, the financial mathematics push toward traditional arrangements that carry lower prevention investment and thus lower exposure when enrollment volatility occurs.

### For Technology Vendors

The comprehensive framework suggests that **member risk stratification capabilities** provide exceptional value in ACO environments. Platforms that identify complex members at highest risk of coverage disruption enable targeted navigation addressing the dominant exposure component.

ACOs need systems that integrate clinical risk data with compliance status monitoring. A member whose clinical profile suggests $50,000 annual healthcare costs and whose work hours are trending toward 80-hour threshold requires different intervention intensity than a healthy member with stable employment. Technology that enables this stratification and triggers appropriate intervention generates returns that justify significant investment.

The total addressable market for ACO-focused compliance navigation technology and services exceeds $600 million annually based on the economics of risk adjustment degradation alone.

## Conclusion

Medicaid ACOs face financial exposure from work requirements that even properly constructed conventional analysis understates by approximately **six to nine times**. The comprehensive seven-component framework reveals that risk adjustment degradation dominates exposure, accounting for roughly 55 percent of total Year 1 impact across all model types.

The sector-wide Year 1 exposure of approximately $2 billion represents a fundamental challenge to value-based care economics. ACOs built their financial models on assumptions of enrollment stability that work requirements destroy. Prevention investments requiring three-year horizons cannot generate returns when 20 percent of the invested population disappears within six months.

Oregon's CCOs face the most concentrated exposure due to global budget structures that maintain fixed infrastructure costs regardless of enrollment fluctuation. Massachusetts ACOs face compounding exposure from quality equity programs that require longitudinal data disrupted by coverage churn. Colorado RAEs face particular vulnerability around behavioral health populations who qualify for exemptions but struggle with documentation.

The insight that matters most: ACOs face greatest financial impact not from members who leave permanently but from **members who cycle through coverage gaps and return with inadequate risk scores**. This reframes intervention strategy. Navigation investment should concentrate on preventing coverage disruption among complex members whose risk adjustment profiles create greatest exposure rather than spreading thin across all expansion adults.

Work requirements implementation will determine whether Medicaid ACOs represent a sustainable delivery system model or a policy experiment that could not survive administrative burden injection. The ACOs that survive will be those that recognize the true nature of their financial exposure and invest accordingly in navigation capability they cannot build internally.
