# Article 18A: The Financial Exposure Nobody Is Calculating

## Work Requirements and the Dual-Dimension Problem MCOs Are Missing

**Series 18: Financial Exposure and Strategic Response**

## The Board Meeting That Got the Math Wrong

The chief financial officer at a mid-size regional Medicaid MCO stood before her board in March 2026 with what she believed was a comprehensive impact analysis. Federal work requirements would take effect in nine months. Her actuarial team had modeled the exposure using standard methodology: 340,000 expansion adults on the plan's rolls, a projected 18% coverage loss rate based on Arkansas and Georgia precedent, average PMPM revenue of $475. The bottom line showed $41 million in annual premium at risk. At historical EBITDA margins of 2.5%, the profit impact came to roughly $1 million. Concerning but manageable. The board approved a $2.8 million navigation support budget and moved to the next agenda item.

Fourteen months later, the plan's actual financial damage from work requirements would exceed $340 million. Not because the disenrollment projections were wrong. They were reasonably close. The catastrophe came from what the spreadsheet never modeled: the financial destruction that occurs not when members leave, but when they come back.

This story, composited from conversations with MCO finance leaders preparing for December 2026 implementation, illustrates a pattern repeating across the Medicaid managed care industry. Organizations are using single-dimension financial analysis to evaluate a two-dimensional problem. They are calculating premium loss from disenrollment while ignoring the mechanisms through which coverage disruption destroys value in ways that persist for years after members return to the rolls.

The result is systematic underinvestment in the one intervention that could prevent the damage: navigation infrastructure that keeps members continuously enrolled.

## The Single-Dimension Trap

Most MCO financial teams approach work requirement exposure through a calculation that feels intuitive and produces numbers that look precise. Take the expansion adult population. Estimate the percentage who will lose coverage based on projected compliance failure rates. Multiply by average per-member-per-month revenue. Apply the plan's historical margin to determine profit impact. This methodology generates a manageable-looking number that invites an appropriately modest response.

The calculation contains a fundamental error that is not mathematical but conceptual. It treats all members as interchangeable revenue units, each generating identical financial impact when coverage ends. A member generating $870 monthly capitation appears to create more exposure than a member generating $380 monthly. But the actual financial damage from losing each of these members operates through entirely different mechanisms, and the lower-revenue member may destroy more value than the higher-revenue one.

The single-dimension approach also assumes that coverage loss represents a permanent departure. The member leaves, the premium stops, the medical costs stop, and the net impact is the margin on lost revenue. For members who permanently exit Medicaid, this logic holds. But work requirements do not primarily create permanent exits. They create coverage gaps. Members lose coverage for three months, six months, sometimes twelve months, then demonstrate compliance and return. The financial damage from this cycling pattern bears no resemblance to what permanent departure would produce.

Understanding why requires examining the two distinct dimensions through which coverage disruption destroys MCO value.

## Dimension One: Complex Member Risk Adjustment Degradation

Medicaid managed care does not pay MCOs a flat rate for every member. It pays risk-adjusted capitation calibrated to each member's documented clinical complexity. A healthy 28-year-old might generate $380 monthly. A 52-year-old with diabetes generates $520. Add hypertension and the payment rises to $630. Add depression and it reaches $740. Add chronic kidney disease and it approaches $870. Each documented condition increments the risk score because each implies higher expected healthcare costs that the MCO must manage.

Risk adjustment relies on hierarchical condition categories, or HCCs, that capture the presence and severity of chronic conditions. These categories must be refreshed annually through documented clinical encounters. A diagnosis code appearing in this year's claims generates payment adjustment for the following year. The same diagnosis without current-year documentation generates nothing.

This documentation requirement creates the mechanism through which coverage gaps destroy value. When a complex member loses coverage for six months and subsequently returns, the state's payment system has no current-year documentation of their chronic conditions for the months they were uninsured. The MCO receives baseline capitation for someone presenting as a new enrollee without documented health history. The actual person has the same chronic conditions they had before losing coverage. If anything, those conditions worsened during months without medication access or clinical monitoring. But the payment system pays for documented conditions, not actual conditions.

Consider a member with diabetes, hypertension, depression, and early chronic kidney disease whose pre-gap risk score generates $870 monthly capitation. During a six-month coverage gap, this member generates zero capitation because they are not enrolled. When they return, their risk score degrades to perhaps $450 monthly because the lookback period now includes months without documented encounters. Actual care costs upon return likely exceed pre-gap levels because medication non-adherence during the gap means uncontrolled blood glucose, elevated blood pressure, worsening kidney function, and deepening depression. The MCO faces actual care costs of perhaps $1,100 monthly while receiving $450 in capitation.

This underpayment persists until new documentation accumulates to recapture the lost HCC codes. If the MCO's primary care network sees patients quarterly, it takes 12 months of consistent engagement to generate four encounters documenting chronic conditions across all relevant HCC categories. During those 12 months, the MCO is systematically underpaid by roughly $420 monthly, or approximately $5,000 total, relative to what appropriate risk adjustment would provide.

Arkansas MCOs experienced precisely this dynamic during the 2018-2019 work requirement implementation. Plans lost substantial revenue from coverage terminations, then faced acute cost pressure when terminated members returned months later with degraded documentation but escalated care needs. The state's capitation rate-setting process, which relied on historical data from stable enrollment periods, could not adequately account for the volatility.

The paradox deepens when you examine which members face the highest risk of compliance failure. Members with serious mental illness, substance use disorders, and multiple chronic conditions are often the ones most likely to qualify for medical exemptions under state rules. They are also the ones least able to navigate exemption documentation without support. Cognitive impairment, executive function limitations, housing instability, and the administrative complexity of demonstrating medical incapacity all conspire against self-navigation. The members generating the highest risk-adjusted revenue are the ones whose coverage loss creates the longest-lasting financial damage, and the ones whose circumstances make self-navigation least likely.

For an MCO with 500,000 expansion adults, if 15% lose coverage at each semi-annual redetermination and half of those losses involve members with above-average complexity, the aggregate HCC recapture lag costs run into tens of millions annually. A plan losing 37,500 members semi-annually, with 18,750 being complex cases, faces aggregate underpayment during recapture periods approaching $40 to $60 million annually once the pattern stabilizes. This single exposure category exceeds the total exposure that conventional analysis identified across all members.

## Dimension Two: Healthy Member Margin Evaporation

The second dimension of financial exposure operates through an entirely different mechanism and affects an entirely different population. While complex members destroy value through risk adjustment degradation upon return, healthy members destroy value through the immediate loss of extraordinary margins they contribute while enrolled.

Consider the member profile that actuaries call "low utilizers." These are expansion adults who are generally healthy, use minimal healthcare services, and generate medical loss ratios well below the plan average. A healthy 31-year-old working inconsistent warehouse hours generates $380 monthly in capitation but may use only $130 monthly in services. The margin this member contributes is not 2-3% of premium. It is closer to 65%. Every month this member remains enrolled, they contribute roughly $250 to the plan's ability to cover costs for sicker members.

When this healthy member loses coverage because variable hours dipped below 80 in a given month, the plan does not lose a small margin slice. It loses the full $250 monthly contribution, which was subsidizing care for complex members who remain enrolled. The plan's medical loss ratio deteriorates immediately because the departing member was pulling the average down.

This mechanism is invisible to conventional exposure analysis because the standard calculation applies average margins to all members. If the plan's overall EBITDA margin is 2.5%, losing a $380 monthly member appears to cost $9.50 in monthly profit. The actual margin contribution lost is $250 monthly, a figure 26 times larger than what average-margin analysis suggests.

The healthy member exposure compounds through a demographic pattern specific to work requirements. Members most likely to fail compliance verification are not primarily those with medical conditions qualifying for exemptions. They are members with unstable employment, variable hours, gig economy participation, seasonal work, and multiple part-time jobs that collectively exceed 80 hours monthly but cannot be easily documented through a single employer verification. These members tend to be younger, healthier, and higher-margin. They fail compliance not because they are not working but because their work patterns do not fit the verification system's assumptions about what employment looks like.

For an MCO with 500,000 expansion adults, the bottom 50% by clinical complexity (roughly 250,000 members) collectively contribute enormous margin that subsidizes care for the top 50%. If work requirements disproportionately cause coverage loss among this healthier cohort, the margin erosion exceeds what any reasonable premium-loss calculation would suggest.

## When Both Dimensions Operate Simultaneously

The dual-dimension exposure framework reveals why conventional analysis understates actual financial impact by 8 to 12 times. A mid-size MCO with 500,000 expansion adults using standard methodology might project $40 million in premium at risk and $1 million in margin impact. The comprehensive dual-dimension analysis for the same MCO produces figures closer to $350 million in total financial exposure.

The gap exists because the two dimensions operate simultaneously across different segments of the same population. Complex members cycle through coverage gaps and return with degraded risk scores, generating persistent underpayment that compounds over multiple redetermination cycles. Healthy members lose coverage and take their extraordinary margins with them, eroding the financial foundation that supports care for remaining members. Some members experience both mechanisms if they have moderate complexity and variable employment.

The interaction effects between dimensions further amplify exposure. When healthy members depart and complex members return with inadequate risk scores, the plan's overall acuity mix shifts upward while average payment shifts downward. The plan serves a sicker population at lower per-member revenue. This is the precise opposite of what successful managed care requires.

Capitation rate-setting processes compound the problem. States set rates based on historical experience data that reflects stable enrollment periods. When work requirements inject volatility into enrollment patterns, the historical data no longer predicts future costs accurately. If the state's rate-setting methodology does not account for the recapture lag, returning members' degraded risk scores pull down the plan's average acuity measure, suppressing rates for the entire book during subsequent contract periods. The financial damage from coverage disruption thus propagates forward through the rate-setting cycle, affecting payment adequacy even for members who never lost coverage.

## The Population Stratification Imperative

Understanding dual-dimension exposure transforms how MCOs should think about their expansion adult populations. Rather than treating all 18.5 million expansion adults nationally as a single risk pool facing uniform work requirement impact, the framework demands stratification into at least four distinct groups requiring different analytical treatment.

The first stratum consists of members with high clinical complexity who are likely exempt but unlikely to self-navigate exemption documentation. These members generate the highest per-member risk adjustment value and the greatest per-member financial damage if coverage is disrupted. Navigation investment of $400 to $600 per member addresses this exposure, yielding returns of 6:1 to 13:1 against risk adjustment degradation of $2,000 to $8,000 per member.

The second stratum consists of healthy members with unstable employment who face elevated compliance risk precisely because they lack the medical conditions that would qualify them for exemptions. These members generate extraordinary margins but are invisible to clinical risk stratification systems designed to identify high-cost members. Navigation investment of $50 to $100 per member addresses this exposure, yielding returns of 25:1 to 35:1 against annual margin contributions of $2,500 to $3,500.

The third stratum consists of members with moderate complexity and stable employment who face lower compliance risk and moderate financial exposure. Standard outreach and automated verification support may be sufficient for this group.

The fourth stratum consists of members who will comply without assistance because they have stable, easily verified employment and no documentation barriers. Investment in this group yields minimal returns because the risk it addresses is already low.

The stratification imperative means that aggregate spending on navigation matters less than how that spending is distributed. An MCO that spreads $5 million evenly across 500,000 members ($10 each) will achieve far less financial protection than an MCO that concentrates $3 million on 7,500 high-complexity members ($400 each) and $1.5 million on 30,000 healthy at-risk members ($50 each), while providing minimal automated support for the remainder.

## What the Right Math Reveals

When MCO boards approve work requirement budgets based on conventional single-dimension analysis, they systematically underinvest. A $2.8 million navigation budget against $1 million in projected margin impact looks generous, a nearly 3:1 investment ratio. The same $2.8 million against $340 million in dual-dimension exposure looks like rounding error.

The right math does not merely increase the number. It changes the nature of the decision. Navigation investment ceases to be a cost center that corporate finance reluctantly approves and becomes the highest-return investment available to the organization. No other capital deployment in Medicaid managed care generates 6:1 to 13:1 returns for complex member retention or 25:1 to 35:1 returns for healthy member retention. Not provider network expansion. Not technology platform upgrades. Not supplemental benefit programs. Not marketing and member acquisition.

Multi-state MCOs face additional complexity in capital allocation. A dollar spent on complex member navigation in Ohio may generate different returns than the same dollar in Georgia, depending on state demographics, regulatory approach, competitive dynamics, and implementation timeline. Enterprise-level optimization must balance state-level adequacy, and the compressed timeline before December 2026 implementation limits how much capability any organization can build internally.

The financial exposure nobody is calculating is not hidden behind complex mathematics. It is hiding behind the wrong analytical framework. The organizations that recognize the dual-dimension problem and invest accordingly will preserve hundreds of millions in value that their competitors will destroy through underinvestment informed by incomplete analysis.

The board meeting that gets the math right looks different. The CFO presents not a single exposure number but a stratified analysis showing distinct financial damage pathways for different member populations. The approved budget reflects the actual returns available from targeted navigation investment. And fourteen months later, the plan's financial performance reflects foresight rather than regret.
