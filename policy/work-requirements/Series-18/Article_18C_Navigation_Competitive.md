# Article 18C: Navigation as Competitive Differentiator

## How Work Requirements Reshape Medicaid Managed Care Competition

**Series 18: Financial Exposure and Strategic Response**

## Two Plans, One County, One Verification Cycle

In a geographic managed care county in the Southeast, two Medicaid MCOs each serve approximately 45,000 expansion adults. Both plans received identical notification from the state Medicaid agency: work requirement verification for the first compliance period would begin on January 1, 2027, with the initial redetermination deadline on June 30.

Plan A invested $2.1 million in navigation infrastructure during 2026. It hired 28 community health workers fluent in the languages spoken by its membership, contracted with four community-based organizations for outreach, built automated text and phone outreach systems triggered by compliance status indicators, and established employer verification partnerships with the county's twelve largest employers of Medicaid expansion adults.

Plan B invested nothing beyond the minimum state-required member notifications. Its compliance strategy consisted of mailing standardized notices to members at 90, 60, and 30 days before the verification deadline, along with a toll-free number staffed by general member services representatives who could explain requirements but could not actively help members document compliance.

After the first verification cycle, Plan A lost 2,200 members to noncompliance disenrollment, a 4.9% loss rate. Plan B lost 7,800 members, a 17.3% loss rate. The 5,600-member differential between the two plans translated to approximately $32 million in annual premium revenue. Plan A's $2.1 million navigation investment generated roughly 15:1 returns in retained revenue, not counting the risk adjustment preservation value for complex members who maintained continuous enrollment.

But the competitive dynamics did not end with differential retention. During the state's next open enrollment period, former Plan B members who regained eligibility and re-enrolled disproportionately chose Plan A. Word traveled through community networks, churches, and social media groups that one plan actually helped people keep their coverage while the other just sent letters. Plan A's enrollment grew by 3,400 members over two subsequent enrollment cycles, a portion of which represented migration from its competitor. Plan B's enrollment declined correspondingly.

This vignette, constructed from early modeling of competitive dynamics in states with geographic managed care, illustrates a transformation in Medicaid managed care competition that no MCO executive anticipated when they built their strategic plans. Work requirements created a new competitive dimension that never existed before: the MCO's ability to help members maintain coverage.

## The Pre-2026 Competitive Landscape

Before federal work requirements, Medicaid managed care competition operated along familiar dimensions. Provider network breadth determined whether members could see their preferred doctors and specialists. Supplemental benefits, things like dental coverage beyond state minimums, vision services, over-the-counter drug allowances, and transportation assistance, differentiated plans on paper even if utilization of these benefits remained modest. Member services quality, measured through call center wait times, grievance resolution rates, and CAHPS survey scores, influenced both state quality ratings and member satisfaction. NCQA accreditation and state quality withhold performance affected plan revenues and reputational positioning.

None of these competitive dimensions involved helping members maintain eligibility. Eligibility determination was a state function. The state's Medicaid agency processed applications, conducted annual redeterminations, and made enrollment and disenrollment decisions. MCOs received enrollment files and managed care for whoever appeared on their membership rolls. When members lost eligibility, the plan lost a member, but neither the plan nor the member had agency in the eligibility process beyond submitting renewal paperwork.

Work requirements fundamentally alter this arrangement. While the state retains formal authority over eligibility determination, the member's ability to maintain eligibility now depends partly on their capacity to document work hours, navigate exemption applications, meet verification deadlines, and resolve compliance disputes. These are activities where MCO support, or lack of support, directly affects outcomes. The MCO becomes a partner in keeping coverage, not merely a payer for services received while coverage exists.

This transformation does not replace existing competitive dimensions. Provider networks, supplemental benefits, and member services still matter. But it adds a dimension that may prove more consequential than any of them because it affects whether members remain enrolled at all, which is the prerequisite for every other competitive dimension to matter.

## The Retention Economics That Drive Competition

The financial mathematics of member retention under work requirements create incentives that reshape competitive strategy. Article 18A's dual-dimension exposure framework establishes that MCOs face two distinct categories of financial damage from coverage disruption: risk adjustment degradation for complex members and margin evaporation for healthy members. Both categories create retention value that far exceeds what conventional margin analysis would suggest.

For complex members with multiple chronic conditions, navigation investment of $400 to $600 per member prevents risk adjustment degradation of $2,000 to $8,000 per member. The return on investment runs 6:1 to 13:1. For healthy members with unstable employment, navigation investment of $50 to $100 per member prevents annual margin loss of $2,500 to $3,500 per member. The return on investment runs 25:1 to 35:1. No other MCO investment generates returns in this range.

These returns accrue exclusively to the plan that retains the member. A member who maintains coverage through Plan A's navigation support generates retention value for Plan A and zero value for Plan B. The competitive implication is that navigation investment does not merely reduce losses. It creates competitive advantage by preserving revenue that competitors forfeit.

In aggregate, the MCO that retains 95% of its expansion adults through effective navigation while its competitor retains only 83% has not simply avoided a bigger loss. It has captured a structural financial advantage that compounds over time. The retained members continue generating premium revenue, risk adjustment value, and margin contribution. The competitor's lost members generate nothing. And when some of those lost members regain eligibility and re-enroll, a portion choose the plan with the reputation for actually helping people, shifting the enrollment base further.

## The Virtuous Cycle and Its Reverse

Navigation investment in competitive Medicaid markets creates self-reinforcing dynamics that amplify initial advantages and punish initial underinvestment.

The virtuous cycle operates as follows. An MCO invests in navigation infrastructure and retains members who would otherwise lose coverage. Retained members continue generating premium revenue and, for complex members, risk-adjusted capitation that reflects their clinical acuity. This preserved revenue funds continued and expanded navigation investment. The plan's reputation for helping members maintain coverage attracts additional enrollment during open enrollment periods, including members with complex needs who have heard from community networks that this plan provides real support. Complex member enrollment increases the plan's average acuity and risk-adjusted revenue per member. Higher revenue per member funds deeper navigation per member. The cycle compounds.

The reverse cycle punishes underinvestment with equal force. An MCO that declines to invest in navigation loses members to noncompliance disenrollment. Lost members reduce premium revenue. Reduced revenue constrains the budget available for future navigation investment. The plan's reputation for inadequate support discourages enrollment during open enrollment periods. Members with complex needs, who are often the most connected to community information networks, preferentially avoid the plan with poor navigation reputation. The plan's remaining population skews toward members who are either easy to retain without support or insufficiently connected to community networks to know they have alternatives. Average acuity may decline, reducing risk-adjusted revenue. Lower revenue further constrains navigation investment. The cycle compounds in the wrong direction.

These dynamics are not theoretical projections. They reflect established patterns in competitive insurance markets where service quality differences create enrollment migration. What is new is the specific mechanism: navigation as the service quality dimension that drives migration. In pre-2026 Medicaid managed care, service quality differences between plans were often too subtle to drive significant enrollment shifts. Members did not switch plans because one had marginally better call center wait times. Navigation quality under work requirements produces a difference members can observe directly. They either kept their coverage or they lost it. That binary outcome creates stronger competitive signals than any prior quality dimension.

## Quality Metrics and Contract Consequences

Competitive dynamics under work requirements extend beyond member choice to regulatory consequences. States will track work requirement outcomes by MCO. Compliance rates, disenrollment patterns, appeals volumes, exemption application success rates, and member complaint data will all be available to state Medicaid agencies at the plan level. Plans with disproportionately high disenrollment rates will face questions.

Several states are already discussing whether to incorporate work requirement compliance metrics into quality withhold programs that tie a portion of MCO capitation to performance. If a state withholds 2% of capitation pending quality performance and adds work requirement metrics to the quality framework, plans with high disenrollment rates face direct payment reductions on top of the revenue loss from member departures. This creates a double penalty for underinvestment: lost members reduce the premium base while quality withhold reductions reduce the rate paid on remaining members.

Contract renewal decisions represent an even higher stakes consequence. State Medicaid agencies evaluate MCO performance across contract periods and make re-procurement decisions based on demonstrated capability. An MCO that shows 17% expansion adult disenrollment rates while its competitor achieves 5% invites scrutiny about whether it is meeting its contractual obligations to support members. In states where managed care contracts include requirements for care coordination, member engagement, and health equity performance, poor work requirement outcomes may provide grounds for contract non-renewal or reduced geographic service areas.

Quality metrics also create transparency that accelerates the competitive dynamics described above. When state Medicaid agencies publish plan-level compliance rates, as most are expected to do, the information reaches advocacy organizations, healthcare providers, community organizations, and eventually members themselves. The published data transforms what would otherwise be subjective reputation into quantified performance differences that inform enrollment decisions. A plan that might have retained members despite poor navigation quality when the quality was invisible loses members when the quality becomes measurable and public.

## The Multi-State Capital Allocation Problem

For national MCOs operating across 15 to 25 states, navigation investment creates a capital allocation challenge that has no precedent in Medicaid managed care history. Every state where the MCO serves expansion adults requires navigation infrastructure. Returns on that investment vary by state demographics, regulatory approach, competitive intensity, and implementation timeline. But all investments compete for the same enterprise capital pool.

A national insurer might calculate that navigation investment in Ohio yields 10:1 returns due to high expansion adult enrollment, a competitive geographic managed care market, and a state regulatory posture that does not provide generous exemptions. The same analysis for a smaller market with favorable exemption policies and limited competition might yield 4:1 returns. Enterprise-level optimization suggests concentrating investment in Ohio at the expense of the smaller market. But the smaller market's members still face coverage loss risk, and the plan's contractual obligations to those members do not diminish because Ohio offers better returns.

This capital allocation tension creates competitive openings in two directions. First, national MCOs that underinvest in specific states create opportunities for regional competitors and local plans that concentrate all resources in single markets. The local plan in the smaller market may invest aggressively despite lower returns because it has no competing uses for its capital and its organizational mission demands full effort. Second, the allocation tension creates demand for external navigation partners that can deploy capability in specific states without competing for MCO enterprise capital. The MCO that partners effectively deploys navigation infrastructure faster and more broadly than the MCO that insists on building everything internally.

The twelve-month timeline before December 2026 implementation intensifies both dynamics. Internal capability building at national scale requires technology development, workforce recruitment, vendor procurement, and organizational change management processes that typically require 18 to 24 months. Partnerships can compress this timeline because the partner organization has already built or is building the capability. Speed becomes a competitive advantage independent of ultimate quality. The plan that deploys adequate navigation by December 2026 captures members from the plan that is still building navigation in March 2027.

## What Regulators Must Decide

State Medicaid agencies designing work requirement implementation face a consequential choice about whether to let market competition drive navigation quality or to mandate minimum navigation standards that all plans must meet.

The competition approach relies on market forces to incentivize navigation investment. Plans that invest retain members. Plans that underinvest lose members. Over time, competitive pressure drives all plans toward adequate navigation or drives inadequate plans from the market. This approach rewards innovation because plans have latitude to develop different navigation models and the market selects for effectiveness. It preserves flexibility because regulators avoid prescribing specific approaches that may not suit all populations or geographies.

The competition approach also accepts that some members will suffer during the period when market forces are sorting winners from losers. Members enrolled in underinvesting plans will lose coverage that members in investing plans would have maintained. This outcome variation is not a function of member behavior or eligibility status. It is a function of plan assignment. Members who happened to enroll in the wrong plan bear consequences for organizational decisions they had no part in making.

The minimum standards approach requires all MCOs to maintain specified navigation capabilities, perhaps minimum navigator-to-member ratios, specified outreach frequencies, multilingual communication requirements, or employer verification system functionality. This approach reduces variation in member outcomes across plans and protects members from bearing consequences of MCO underinvestment. But it also limits innovation by prescribing specific approaches, potentially increases costs for plans already investing above the minimums, and creates compliance burden that may particularly strain smaller plans with limited administrative capacity.

Hybrid approaches are possible. A state might establish minimum navigation standards while also incorporating work requirement outcomes into quality withhold programs that reward superior performance. This protects a floor while preserving competitive incentives above the floor. The design details of such hybrid frameworks, what counts as minimum compliance, how performance is measured, what consequences attach to underperformance, determine whether the approach actually achieves its dual objectives or merely adds administrative complexity without improving outcomes.

The regulatory design choice will vary by state based on managed care market structure, political orientation, and administrative capacity. States with competitive markets and multiple MCOs per region may rely more on competition. States with limited competition, single-plan counties, or county-organized health systems may need stronger minimum standards because competitive pressure is absent. The choice is not merely technical. It reflects whether the state views work requirement outcomes as primarily an MCO responsibility, primarily a state responsibility, or a shared obligation requiring both minimum standards and competitive incentives.

Whatever regulators decide, the competitive dynamics described in this article will reshape the Medicaid managed care landscape. Plans that recognize navigation as the new competitive frontier and invest accordingly will emerge from the first years of work requirements with stronger enrollment, healthier financials, and better regulatory standing than plans that treat navigation as peripheral. Work requirements may prove to be the most significant competitive disruption in Medicaid managed care since the original shift from fee-for-service to capitation.
