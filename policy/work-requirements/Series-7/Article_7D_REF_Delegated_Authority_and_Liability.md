# Delegated Authority and Liability Framework
*Legal architecture for third-party verification and exemption support*

States cannot directly verify work or determine exemptions for 18.5 million people. Success requires delegating submission authority to employers, providers, educational institutions, managed care organizations, and community partners. But delegation creates legal questions: What authority can states delegate? Who bears liability when delegated entities make errors? What protections incentivize participation?

This article provides the legal and operational framework for delegation systems that enable third-party verification while protecting all parties from unreasonable liability exposure.

## Constitutional and Legal Foundation

### State Authority to Delegate Medicaid Functions

**Federal framework:** Section 1115 waivers and State Plan Amendments give states broad flexibility in Medicaid administration but require maintaining ultimate state authority over eligibility determinations.

**Permissible delegation:**
- Data collection and submission (clearly allowed)
- Initial screening and assessment (allowed with state oversight)
- Recommendation on eligibility/exemption (allowed if state makes final determination)
- Case management and navigation support (clearly allowed)

**Impermissible delegation:**
- Final eligibility determination (must be state function)
- Appeals decisions (must be state authority)
- Program policy setting (state responsibility)
- Enforcement actions (state authority)

**Recommended framework:** States delegate data submission, initial assessments, and recommendations. State retains final determination authority with streamlined approval for clear cases.

### Due Process Requirements

**Constitutional minimums when private entities participate:**
- Notice of adverse actions
- Opportunity to be heard
- Impartial decision-maker
- Right to state-level review
- Written decision with reasoning

**Application to work requirements:**
- Employer reports zero hours â†’ member receives notice and opportunity to dispute
- Provider denies exemption documentation â†’ member can appeal to state
- MCO determines member doesn't qualify for support â†’ state reviews if requested
- Educational institution reports non-enrollment â†’ member can provide contrary evidence

**Key principle:** Private entity actions are recommendations or data submissions. State makes final determination. Individual always has right to state review.

## Federal Approval Requirements

### CMS Review of Delegation Framework

**State Plan Amendment requirements:**
States must document in SPA or 1115 waiver:
- Which functions will be delegated and to which entity types
- Credentialing requirements for each entity type
- Oversight and audit protocols
- Safe harbor and liability protections
- Individual due process rights
- State's retained ultimate authority

**CMS approval criteria:**
- State maintains final determination authority
- Adequate oversight of delegated entities
- Due process protections for beneficiaries
- Data security and privacy safeguards
- Quality assurance mechanisms
- Ability to revoke delegation if problems arise

**Common CMS concerns:**
- Private entities making final eligibility determinations (not permissible)
- Inadequate oversight of delegated entities
- Insufficient beneficiary protections
- Unclear liability and appeal rights
- Conflicts of interest (MCOs both providing care and making coverage determinations)

**Addressing CMS concerns:**
- Emphasize delegation is data submission, not determination
- Document robust oversight plan
- Build in state review rights for all adverse actions
- Separate MCO care provision from administrative support
- Include sunset provisions allowing evaluation and adjustment

### Timeline for Federal Approval

**December 2025:** Submit draft delegation framework to CMS for informal feedback

**January 2026:** Incorporate CMS feedback into formal SPA/waiver amendment

**February 2026:** Submit formal amendment to CMS

**March-April 2026:** CMS review and approval (90-day clock)

**May 2026:** Approval received (or conditional approval with modifications)

**June-November 2026:** Implement approved framework, begin credentialing

**December 2026:** Implementation with approved delegation framework operational

## Conflict of Interest Management

### MCO Conflicts

**Potential conflict:** MCO has financial incentive to deny verification support (saves admin costs) or inappropriately approve exemptions (keeps members enrolled and receiving capitation).

**Mitigation strategies:**
- Payment structure: Capitation adjustment based on actual verification support provided (incentivizes appropriate support)
- Performance metrics: Monitor exemption rates, coverage retention, appeals by MCO
- Independent audits: State audits MCO exemption facilitation practices
- Member choice: Members can work directly with state instead of through MCO
- Separated functions: Care coordinators who support verification separate from utilization management

### Provider Conflicts

**Potential conflict:** Provider may inappropriately attest to exemptions to maintain patient relationship and avoid conflict.

**Mitigation strategies:**
- Professional standards: Clear guidance that attestations must reflect clinical judgment
- Audit focus: Monitor providers with unusually high exemption rates
- Malpractice protection: Safe harbor encourages honest attestations without fear of patient retaliation
- Anonymous reporting: Mechanism for reporting providers who pressure inappropriate attestations

### Employer Conflicts

**Potential conflict:** Employer may misreport hours to help or harm employees.

**Mitigation strategies:**
- Audit randomly: Verify reported hours against payroll records
- Employee verification: Employees can dispute employer-reported hours
- Safe harbor limits: Protections only apply to good-faith reporting
- Whistleblower protection: Employees can report employer misreporting without retaliation

## Individual Rights and Due Process

### Right to Challenge Delegated Entity Actions

**Employer-reported hours:**
- Individual receives monthly statement of hours reported by employer
- 60 days to dispute if hours appear incorrect
- Dispute triggers state review of payroll records
- Coverage continues during dispute resolution
- State makes final determination

**Provider exemption denial:**
- Individual notified if provider declines to provide attestation
- Can seek attestation from different provider
- Can submit exemption application with available documentation
- State reviews and determines if exemption warranted without provider support
- Appeal rights if state denies

**Educational institution non-enrollment:**
- Individual receives notification of institution-reported status
- Can provide contrary evidence (enrollment confirmation, schedule, tuition receipt)
- State investigates discrepancy
- Coverage continues during investigation
- Correction made if institution error

**MCO denial of navigation support:**
- Individual can request state-provided navigator instead
- Can file complaint with state if MCO fails to provide promised support
- State investigates complaints and imposes corrective action on MCO if warranted

### State Review Process

**When individual challenges delegated entity data:**

**Step 1 - Initial review (10 business days):**
- State contacts entity for documentation
- Reviews individual's contrary evidence
- Makes preliminary determination

**Step 2 - If discrepancy remains (additional 10 days):**
- State may request additional documentation from both parties
- May conduct interview with individual
- May inspect entity records directly

**Step 3 - Final determination (5 days after investigation complete):**
- Written decision explaining findings
- Coverage determination based on preponderance of evidence
- Right to appeal state decision through normal Medicaid appeals

**Coverage during review:** Presumptive eligibility maintained throughout entire process.

## Insurance and Bonding Requirements

### When Required

**Generally not required for:**
- Employers (already have general business liability insurance)
- Healthcare providers (already have malpractice insurance)
- Educational institutions (already insured)

**May be required for:**
- New MCOs without established track record
- Small volunteer organizations handling sensitive data
- Payroll processors specifically for verification function
- Community-based organizations depending on volume

### Recommended Coverage

**When insurance required:**
- Errors and omissions coverage: $1-5 million depending on volume
- Cyber liability: $1-2 million for data breach coverage
- General liability: $1 million minimum

**Bonding:**
- Generally not required unless entity handles funds (not typical for verification)
- May be required for community-based intermediaries handling member funds for other purposes

## Model Agreements and Templates

### Employer Credentialing Agreement

**Key terms:**
- Employer agrees to submit hours as recorded in standard business records
- Employer acknowledges safe harbor protections and limitations
- Employer agrees to correct errors when discovered
- Employer designates authorized submitters
- Employer maintains audit trail for 3 years
- State may audit submissions
- Either party may terminate with 30 days notice

### Provider Attestation Agreement

**Key terms:**
- Provider agrees attestations reflect professional clinical judgment
- Provider acknowledges safe harbor for good-faith attestations
- Provider agrees to maintain documentation in medical records
- Provider submits attestations only for established patients
- State may audit and require supporting documentation
- Safe harbor protections apply absent fraud
- Provider may decline to attest without penalty

### MCO Contract Amendment

**Key provisions:**
- MCO responsibilities for verification facilitation
- Performance metrics and reporting requirements
- Payment adjustment for verification support
- Liability limitations as intermediary
- Data security and privacy requirements
- State oversight and audit rights
- Member grievance and appeal processes

## Conclusion: Delegation as System Enabler

Work requirements cannot function without delegation. States cannot directly verify work for millions of people. The framework must:

**Enable participation** through clear authority and reasonable liability protections.

**Maintain accountability** through credentialing, oversight, and audit.

**Protect individuals** through due process and state review rights.

**Preserve state authority** with delegated entities making submissions, not determinations.

**Balance efficiency with integrity** through risk-based audits rather than universal verification.

States have 8 months to build delegation frameworks, obtain federal approval, credential entities, and create oversight systems. The legal architecture determines whether third parties participate willingly or avoid involvement due to liability fears.
