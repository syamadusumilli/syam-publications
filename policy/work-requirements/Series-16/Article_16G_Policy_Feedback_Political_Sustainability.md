# Article 16G: Policy Feedback and Political Sustainability

## How Implementation Shapes Future Politics

Policies create politics. The Affordable Care Act generated constituencies that proved remarkably difficult to dismantle when Republicans controlled both chambers of Congress and the presidency in 2017. Social Security transformed seniors from among the most politically marginalized Americans into the most reliably participatory voting bloc. Medicare created entitlements that politicians of both parties now treat as untouchable. The structure of these programs shaped who benefited, who mobilized, and who defended them when retrenchment threatened.

Work requirements will generate their own political feedback. What remains uncertain is whether that feedback will entrench the policy or undermine it. If implementation causes visible suffering concentrated among sympathetic populations, will that create backlash that leads to modification or repeal? If implementation proceeds without dramatic visible harm, will work requirements become normalized features of Medicaid that future administrations of either party accept? If some states succeed while others fail, will differentiation become the stable equilibrium?

Policy feedback theory offers a framework for anticipating how implementation will shape political sustainability. The theory examines how policies generate resources and incentives for political actors, provide information and cues that shape interpretations of the political world, and create constituencies that mobilize to defend or attack the resulting arrangements. Applied to work requirements, this framework helps identify which implementation features are most likely to generate political consequences and what those consequences might look like.

The political sustainability of work requirements is not predetermined. It depends on implementation choices that have not yet been made, outcomes that have not yet occurred, and political mobilization that has not yet materialized. Understanding the mechanisms through which policies shape politics helps stakeholders anticipate possibilities and position themselves strategically as December 2026 approaches.

## The Theory of Policy Feedback

Paul Pierson's foundational work on policy feedback identified two primary mechanisms through which policies affect politics. Resource effects describe how policies provide or deny resources that affect political capacity. A policy that provides benefits creates stakeholders who will mobilize to defend those benefits. A policy that imposes costs creates opponents who may mobilize to change or eliminate it. The distribution of resources across populations shapes who has capacity for political action and who remains quiescent.

Interpretive effects describe how policies shape how people understand citizenship, obligation, and their relationship to the state. A policy that treats recipients as deserving citizens with legitimate claims teaches different lessons than a policy that treats recipients as suspect claimants requiring surveillance. These interpretive lessons influence whether people see government as ally or adversary, whether they believe political action is worthwhile, and whether they identify with other beneficiaries or distinguish themselves from them.

Andrea Louise Campbell's research on Social Security demonstrates how these mechanisms combine to create powerful constituency effects. Before Social Security, seniors were among the most economically vulnerable and least politically active Americans. The program's universal structure, contribution-based framing, and reliable benefit delivery transformed seniors into active defenders of their benefits. Low-income seniors, most dependent on Social Security, showed the largest participatory gains. The program's design created a constituency that politicians of both parties now treat as untouchable.

Joe Soss's research on welfare programs demonstrates the opposite pattern. The design of programs like AFDC and its successor TANF treated recipients as suspects requiring surveillance and compliance verification. Caseworker discretion, intrusive eligibility determination, and stigmatizing program structures taught recipients that government was adversary rather than ally. These lessons suppressed political participation among welfare recipients, contributing to their political marginalization and making welfare programs easier targets for retrenchment than universal programs like Social Security.

Work requirements occupy uncertain territory between these models. They condition Medicaid benefits on behavioral compliance, introducing the surveillance and verification dynamics that suppressed political participation among welfare recipients. But they apply to populations already receiving Medicaid, creating potential coverage losers who may mobilize differently than populations never covered. The feedback effects will depend on how requirements are implemented, who loses coverage, and whether losses concentrate visibly enough to generate political response.

## Resource Effects: Winners, Losers, and Mobilization Asymmetry

Resource effects flow from who gains and who loses from policy change. Work requirements create several categories of affected populations whose political responses may differ.

Coverage losers are those who lose Medicaid coverage due to work requirement non-compliance. CBO projects approximately 5.3 million more uninsured people by 2034 under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act's Medicaid provisions. These individuals lose a concrete resource, healthcare coverage, that they previously possessed. In theory, concentrated losses should motivate political mobilization. In practice, coverage losers face several barriers to collective action.

First, coverage losers are dispersed across states, counties, and circumstances. They do not share physical proximity, institutional connections, or pre-existing organizational infrastructure that would facilitate collective mobilization. Unlike seniors who can organize through AARP or unions whose members share workplace connections, people who lose Medicaid for documentation failures lack natural organizing structures.

Second, coverage loss often occurs during periods of personal crisis. The populations most likely to lose coverage are those facing multiple simultaneous challenges: job transitions, housing instability, family disruption, health crises. These are precisely the circumstances that consume capacity for political action. People struggling to maintain housing, manage health conditions without insurance, and navigate bureaucratic systems have little bandwidth remaining for political mobilization.

Third, coverage losers may not identify as a collective political constituency. Someone who loses Medicaid because they missed a reporting deadline may blame themselves rather than the system. Someone who loses coverage during a job transition may see their situation as temporary and individual rather than systemic and shared. The policy design that treats non-compliance as individual failure rather than system dysfunction discourages collective identification among those the system fails.

Compliance successes are those who meet work requirements and maintain coverage. These individuals may develop psychological investment in the system they successfully navigated. Having demonstrated compliance, they may view others who fail as deserving their fate. The "I did it, why can't they?" response creates potential constituency for maintaining requirements rather than relaxing them. This constituency effect, where those who successfully navigate barriers support maintaining those barriers, has appeared in other contexts and may emerge around work requirements.

Administrative stakeholders represent another resource effect category. Verification systems create jobs. State Medicaid agencies hire staff to process exemptions and review documentation. Technology vendors receive contracts for system development. Community organizations receive funding for navigation assistance. These administrative interests have stakes in program continuation regardless of policy outcomes. Once built, verification infrastructure creates constituencies invested in its perpetuation.

The asymmetry between concentrated benefits and diffuse costs shapes political outcomes. Pierson's analysis of welfare state retrenchment found that the politics of taking away benefits differs fundamentally from the politics of extending them. Benefit expansion creates diffuse costs spread across taxpayers and concentrated benefits for recipients. Benefit retrenchment creates concentrated costs for losers and diffuse benefits for taxpayers. Concentrated losses motivate political action more powerfully than diffuse gains, which should theoretically protect existing programs from retrenchment.

But work requirements complicate this calculus. Coverage losses are concentrated among recipients, but those recipients face barriers to mobilization that attenuate their political response. The potential beneficiaries of retrenchment, taxpayers who might see lower Medicaid costs, remain diffuse but are organized through ideological infrastructure that frames work requirements as principled policy rather than benefit cuts. Conservative advocacy organizations like the Foundation for Government Accountability have invested decades in building capacity to support work requirements politically. No equivalent infrastructure exists to mobilize coverage losers.

## Interpretive Effects: What Policies Teach Citizens

Beyond resource distribution, policies teach lessons about citizenship, government, and political efficacy. Suzanne Mettler's work on the "submerged state" demonstrates that Americans often fail to recognize government benefits they receive, undermining potential constituency development. The mortgage interest deduction delivers substantial housing subsidies to homeowners who frequently deny receiving government assistance. Tax credits and employer-based health insurance operate through mechanisms that obscure government's role, preventing the constituency effects that visible programs generate.

Medicaid occupies complex terrain in this analysis. Unlike submerged state policies, Medicaid is visible. Recipients know they receive government health insurance. But Medicaid's design sends mixed messages about citizenship. Unlike Social Security's contribution-based framing that positions recipients as having earned benefits, Medicaid's means-tested eligibility positions recipients as objects of government benevolence. Unlike Medicare's universal enrollment for seniors, Medicaid's complex eligibility determination positions recipients as claimants whose worthiness must be verified.

Work requirements intensify these interpretive dynamics. The requirement to demonstrate work activity or exemption eligibility reinforces the message that Medicaid recipients must prove deserving status. Monthly verification treats recipients as suspects whose compliance must be continuously monitored. Termination for documentation failure teaches that government support is conditional and precarious. These interpretive lessons align with what Soss found suppressed political participation among welfare recipients.

Jamila Michener's research on Medicaid and democratic citizenship found that program design significantly affects beneficiaries' political engagement. In states with more generous Medicaid programs and less burdensome administration, beneficiaries showed higher levels of political participation. In states with restrictive programs and burdensome processes, beneficiaries showed lower participation and more negative views of government. Federalism's variation in Medicaid design created corresponding variation in citizenship experiences and political engagement.

Work requirements will extend these dynamics nationally. Verification systems that treat recipients respectfully and minimize burden may generate different interpretive effects than systems emphasizing surveillance and compliance enforcement. Georgia's zero-friction annual reporting sends different messages than Arkansas's monthly online-only verification that terminated 18,000 people. The citizenship lessons work requirements teach will vary with implementation design, creating state-level variation in political feedback effects.

The interpretive effects may also influence non-recipients. Public understanding of work requirements shapes whether coverage losses are attributed to individual failure or system dysfunction. Article 16D examined how media framing shapes public opinion, finding that abstract support for work requirements drops substantially when people learn that most recipients already work or qualify for exemptions. If coverage losses are interpreted as system failure, backlash becomes more likely. If coverage losses are interpreted as appropriate consequences for non-compliant individuals, normalization becomes more likely.

## The 1996 Welfare Reform Precedent

The most direct policy precedent for Medicaid work requirements is the 1996 welfare reform that replaced Aid to Families with Dependent Children with Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. That reform imposed work requirements, time limits, and block grant funding on cash assistance to poor families. The political feedback from that reform offers both instruction and caution for anticipating work requirement effects.

Welfare reform generated remarkably little political backlash despite substantial coverage losses. TANF caseloads declined over 60 percent from 1994 to 2005. The number of families receiving cash assistance fell to levels not seen since the 1960s. Only 23 families received TANF benefits for every 100 poor families with children by 2014, down from 76 per 100 in 1995. By any measure, welfare reform dramatically reduced the population receiving benefits.

Yet this massive reduction produced no sustained political mobilization from affected populations. No "welfare recipients' movement" emerged to challenge TANF's restrictions. Electoral consequences for politicians who supported welfare reform were minimal to nonexistent. The policy became accepted across party lines, with even Democratic administrations maintaining TANF's basic structure.

Several factors explain welfare's political vulnerability that may or may not apply to Medicaid. First, welfare recipients were always a politically marginalized population. They voted at low rates, lacked organizational infrastructure, and faced barriers to political action that predated welfare reform. The interpretive effects of AFDC administration had already suppressed political participation; TANF merely continued those dynamics.

Second, welfare reform occurred during a strong economy. Caseload declines coincided with economic expansion that provided alternative income sources for many families leaving welfare. Whether welfare reform caused caseload decline or merely coincided with economic improvement remains debated, but the strong economy masked whatever hardship the policy caused.

Third, welfare populations lacked sympathetic public image. Decades of racialized media coverage had associated welfare with stereotypes of undeserving recipients. Martin Gilens's research documented how media overrepresented Black faces in unsympathetic poverty coverage, building associations between welfare and perceived lack of work ethic. This framing made coverage losses politically acceptable in ways they might not have been for more sympathetically portrayed populations.

Fourth, welfare reform included provisions like the Earned Income Tax Credit expansion that cushioned losses for working poor families. The policy combined retrenchment of unconditional benefits with expansion of work-conditioned benefits, allowing supporters to frame reform as supporting work rather than abandoning the poor.

Medicaid work requirements share some but not all of these characteristics. Medicaid recipients include significant numbers of working adults and families, complicating the undeserving framing that undermined welfare constituencies. Healthcare coverage loss produces more immediate and visible consequences than cash assistance reduction, particularly when people face medical emergencies without insurance. The populations affected by Medicaid work requirements include rural communities and working-class whites who have become central to Republican electoral coalitions, creating potential for intra-party tensions that welfare reform did not generate.

The precedent suggests caution about expecting political backlash from coverage losses. It also suggests that political sustainability depends heavily on factors beyond policy design: economic conditions, media framing, and whether affected populations have organizational infrastructure and public sympathy. Work requirements will unfold in a different political environment than 1996 welfare reform, and predicting feedback effects requires attention to those contextual differences.

## The ACA Precedent: Constituency Creation and Policy Resilience

A more recent and perhaps more relevant precedent is the Affordable Care Act's experience with policy feedback. The ACA created new Medicaid coverage for expansion adults and new marketplace coverage with premium subsidies. These constituencies proved remarkably resilient when Republicans sought repeal in 2017.

Jacob Hacker and Paul Pierson analyzed the 2017 repeal effort as a test of policy feedback theory. According to standard theory, the political fallout associated with dismantling social programs should deter electorally sensitive politicians from large-scale retrenchment. The ACA had created millions of new beneficiaries who would lose coverage under repeal. Those concentrated losses should have generated political pressure sufficient to block repeal.

The reality was more complicated. Republicans came within three Senate votes of passing "skinny repeal" that would have eliminated ACA's individual mandate and begun dismantling the coverage expansion. The political fallout that should have deterred retrenchment nearly proved insufficient. Hacker and Pierson attribute the near-miss to Republican radicalization rooted in distinct electoral and organizational realities that increased the party's desire to move right and capacity to do so, even when seeking to enact distinctly unpopular policies.

What ultimately stopped repeal was not diffuse public opinion but concentrated resistance. Town hall meetings where constituents confronted Republican legislators made coverage loss visible and politically costly. Senator John McCain's dramatic thumbs-down vote reflected political calculation as well as principle. The narrow failure demonstrated that policy feedback effects can protect programs but are not automatic; they require activation through political mobilization.

The ACA precedent suggests several lessons for work requirement sustainability. First, constituency effects require time to develop. The ACA nearly fell to repeal only seven years after passage, before constituencies had fully consolidated. Work requirements face immediate implementation with constituencies that are being created and potentially disrupted simultaneously, a more volatile situation than established programs face.

Second, visibility matters enormously. The ACA repeal effort became politically costly when coverage losses became visible through constituent stories, media coverage, and town hall confrontations. If work requirement coverage losses remain invisible, distributed across individual cases that never aggregate into visible political phenomenon, backlash may not materialize. If losses concentrate and become visible, backlash potential increases.

Third, organizational infrastructure amplifies feedback effects. Progressive advocacy organizations, healthcare industry stakeholders, and Democratic politicians coordinated opposition to ACA repeal in ways that mobilized latent constituency effects. Work requirement coverage losses would need similar organizational amplification to translate into political consequences.

Fourth, intra-party dynamics matter. ACA repeal threatened Republican legislators in districts where significant numbers of constituents had gained coverage. Work requirements may create similar dynamics if coverage losses concentrate in Republican-leaning areas, particularly rural communities dependent on Medicaid expansion coverage. But whether Republican legislators perceive those losses as politically threatening depends on whether they become visible and whether constituents connect coverage loss to policy choice.

## Scenario Analysis: Possible Political Futures

Policy feedback analysis suggests several possible scenarios for work requirement political sustainability, each reflecting different combinations of implementation outcomes and political mobilization.

Backlash and modification describes a future where visible harm creates political costs sufficient to force policy change. This scenario requires several conditions: coverage losses concentrated enough to be visible, media coverage that frames losses as system failure rather than individual non-compliance, affected populations or their advocates mobilizing politically, and legislators perceiving electoral vulnerability from association with coverage losses. Under this scenario, work requirements remain in place but are modified through expanded exemptions, extended cure periods, or reduced verification burden. The policy exists formally while being softened in practice.

Normalization and acceptance describes a future where implementation proceeds without dramatic visible harm. Coverage losses occur but remain dispersed, individualized, and attributed to non-compliance rather than system failure. Media coverage treats work requirements as normal program administration rather than newsworthy controversy. Affected populations do not mobilize, either because losses are insufficient to trigger mobilization or because barriers to collective action prove insurmountable. Under this scenario, work requirements become accepted features of Medicaid that future administrations of both parties maintain, much as TANF's work requirements became accepted features of cash assistance policy.

Permanent controversy describes a future of ongoing conflict without resolution. Work requirements face continuous legal challenges, advocacy opposition, and implementation disputes. Some states experience backlash and modify implementation; others entrench enforcement approaches. Federal policy oscillates with presidential administrations: enforcement-oriented guidance under Republican administrations, accommodation-oriented guidance under Democratic ones. Neither side achieves definitive victory, and work requirements remain contested terrain rather than settled policy.

State differentiation describes a future where different states experience different feedback effects. Georgia's zero-friction approach maintains coverage and generates positive feedback, entrenching the policy through demonstrated success. States pursuing enforcement approaches generate coverage losses, backlash, and modification pressure. The result is stable variation: some states maintain work requirements that function as genuine behavioral conditions, others maintain requirements that function as compliance theater without coverage effects, and still others modify or effectively nullify requirements through administrative accommodation.

Which scenario proves most likely depends on factors that cannot be known before implementation: how states design verification systems, how affected populations respond to coverage losses, how media frames implementation outcomes, and how electoral dynamics evolve as 2026 and 2028 approach. Policy feedback analysis cannot predict the future, but it can identify the mechanisms through which implementation will shape political possibilities.

## The Constituency Problem

The fundamental challenge for work requirement political sustainability is the constituency problem. Policies that create grateful beneficiaries who mobilize to defend them prove politically durable. Policies that create stigmatized, marginalized, or dispersed populations who do not mobilize prove politically vulnerable. Where do work requirements fall on this spectrum?

Work requirements do not obviously create grateful constituencies. People who maintain coverage through successful compliance may credit their own effort rather than the program. People who lose coverage experience harm rather than benefit. Administrative stakeholders benefit from program operation but are not natural public advocates for the policy's political defense.

The compliance constituency hypothesis suggests that people who successfully navigate requirements may develop investment in maintaining them. Having demonstrated worthiness through compliance, they may support continuing to distinguish themselves from those who fail. This dynamic appeared in other contexts where program participants who succeed develop identification with program requirements. If compliance creates constituency, work requirements may generate their own defenders from within the affected population.

The taxpayer constituency hypothesis suggests that work requirements create benefit for taxpayers who believe Medicaid spending is reduced or better targeted. This constituency is real but diffuse, unlikely to mobilize specifically around work requirements rather than broader fiscal or ideological concerns. Conservative advocacy organizations serve as constituency proxies, representing ideological commitment to conditionality even if actual taxpayer mobilization remains limited.

The healthcare industry constituency could provide more concrete political support, but industry interests are complicated. MCOs benefit from enrollment stability that work requirements may undermine. Hospitals benefit from coverage that work requirements may reduce. Providers benefit from insured patients that work requirements may disenroll. The healthcare industry has not mobilized as work requirement defenders, and their economic interests may push toward coverage protection rather than requirement enforcement.

The absence of natural constituency suggests work requirement political sustainability depends heavily on ideological commitment from conservative advocates and politicians rather than mobilized beneficiary support. This creates asymmetry: the policy's defenders are ideologically motivated organizations with sustained capacity for political engagement, while the policy's opponents include dispersed populations with limited capacity and healthcare interests with complicated motivations. That asymmetry favored work requirement adoption and may favor political sustainability, at least until implementation generates consequences visible enough to shift the political calculus.

## Implications for Stakeholders

Policy feedback analysis offers strategic implications for stakeholders navigating work requirement implementation.

For states seeking to minimize coverage losses, understanding feedback effects suggests designing systems that maintain enrollment rather than maximize terminations. The political costs of visible coverage losses may exceed the administrative costs of generous exemptions and accessible verification. Georgia's pivot from technology-heavy enforcement to zero-friction annual reporting reflected learning that implementation generating coverage loss stories created political liabilities that implementation maintaining coverage did not. States that design for enrollment protection may find that choice creates its own political sustainability through demonstrated success.

For advocates seeking to protect coverage, understanding feedback effects suggests focusing on visibility. Coverage losses that remain individual and dispersed generate less political pressure than losses that aggregate into visible phenomena. Documentation of patterns, amplification through media coverage, and organizational infrastructure that connects individual experiences into collective understanding may activate backlash potential that would otherwise remain latent. The 2017 ACA repeal fight demonstrated that constituency effects require activation; they do not operate automatically.

For healthcare industry stakeholders, understanding feedback effects suggests that quiet acceptance of coverage losses may prove more costly than expected. MCO revenue depends on enrollment that work requirements threaten. Hospital finances depend on coverage that work requirements may reduce. If industry stakeholders wait for backlash to materialize before engaging, they may find that normalization has already occurred. Early engagement in implementation design may prove more effective than late response to coverage losses.

For conservative supporters of work requirements, understanding feedback effects suggests that implementation approach affects political sustainability. Aggressive enforcement that produces visible coverage losses may generate backlash that undermines the policy's long-term future. Enforcement that maintains the principle of work requirements while minimizing coverage losses may prove more politically sustainable, even if it produces less behavioral change. The question is whether work requirements' purpose is achieved through compliance enforcement or through symbolic commitment to conditionality.

## The December 2026 Inflection Point

December 2026 represents an inflection point where work requirements shift from abstraction to reality. The political dynamics of debating work requirements differ fundamentally from the political dynamics of experiencing them. Public opinion research shows abstract support dropping substantially when people learn implementation details. That pattern suggests implementation may shift political terrain in ways current polling does not capture.

The first year of implementation will likely determine political trajectory. Visible problems create narrative momentum toward backlash; smooth implementation creates narrative momentum toward acceptance. Arkansas's 2018 experience generated national media coverage of coverage losses that shaped the work requirement debate for years. Georgia's low-visibility enrollment has generated almost no coverage, positive or negative. Which pattern characterizes national implementation will shape which political future materializes.

For 18.5 million expansion adults facing work requirements, the political sustainability question is not academic. It determines whether coverage losses trigger policy modification or acceptance, whether struggling with verification systems generates systemic reform or individual blame, whether the Medicaid program continues serving as pathway to healthcare or becomes additional barrier in lives already filled with barriers.

Policy feedback theory cannot predict outcomes. But it can identify the mechanisms through which implementation will generate political consequences. Understanding those mechanisms helps stakeholders position themselves strategically as work requirements transition from policy debate to lived reality.
