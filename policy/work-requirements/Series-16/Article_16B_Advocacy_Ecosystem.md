# Article 16B: The Advocacy Ecosystem

## Who Shapes Work Requirement Policy

*The organizations fighting for and against Medicaid work requirements, and the stakeholders caught in between*

The email blast went out within hours of the reconciliation bill's passage. The Foundation for Government Accountability celebrated a "historic victory" that would "restore the dignity of work to millions of able-bodied adults." The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities warned that 7 to 14 million people would lose healthcare coverage. The National Health Law Program announced it was mobilizing for litigation. The American Hospital Association issued a statement expressing "concern" about enrollment volatility while carefully avoiding opposition to the underlying policy.

Four organizations, four responses, each reflecting decades of institutional history, strategic positioning, and ideological commitment. Work requirements did not emerge from abstract policy analysis conducted by neutral experts. They emerged from sustained advocacy by specific organizations with identifiable funders, staff, and strategies. The opposition that may yet shape implementation reflects equally organized advocacy with its own institutional foundation. Understanding who is doing what, with what resources, and toward what ends illuminates the political context surrounding December 2026.

The advocacy ecosystem operates on multiple levels. National organizations develop arguments, conduct research, draft model legislation, and coordinate strategy. State-level affiliates localize those strategies, testify before legislatures, and shape implementation details. Legal organizations prepare litigation that constrains what states can do. Healthcare industry stakeholders pursue economic interests that may align with either side depending on context. Grassroots organizations represent affected populations, though their capacity to shape policy varies enormously.

Article 16A examined why states choose different implementation approaches. Article 16F examined how federal-state dynamics shape implementation authority. This article maps the organizations actively working to shape those choices. The ecosystem is not symmetric. Conservative infrastructure has built over decades toward this moment. Progressive opposition mobilizes from established positions but faces a policy environment transformed by statutory mandate. Healthcare industry stakeholders hold potential influence they have not fully exercised. Understanding these dynamics helps readers navigate the political landscape surrounding work requirements.

## Conservative Policy Infrastructure

The organizational roots of work requirements trace to the welfare reform era of the 1990s, but the infrastructure that translated philosophical commitments into Medicaid policy developed more recently. A network of think tanks, advocacy organizations, and political operatives created the intellectual foundation, model legislation, and state-by-state advocacy that made federal work requirements possible.

The Foundation for Government Accountability has been the most influential single organization in promoting Medicaid work requirements. Founded in Naples, Florida in 2011 by Tarren Bragdon, a former Maine state legislator and past CEO of the Maine Heritage Policy Center, FGA distinguished itself from traditional think tanks through emphasis on policy marketing and implementation rather than original research. As one observer noted, FGA is not doing much "thinking" in the traditional sense; instead, it markets, pushes, repackages, and franchises policy ideas for state-level implementation.

FGA's fingerprints appear on most state work requirement proposals. The organization provides model legislation, talking points, polling data, and rapid response capability to state legislators pursuing work requirements. It testifies before legislative committees, briefs governors' offices, and connects state officials with peers in other states who have pursued similar policies. In 2022, FGA reported achieving 144 "state policy reform wins" including 45 related to unemployment and welfare. The organization claims credit for preventing Medicaid expansion in thirteen states, understanding that blocking expansion and imposing work requirements serve the same underlying goal of limiting Medicaid coverage.

FGA's influence extends to federal policy. In October 2025, during the government shutdown, FGA president Tarren Bragdon addressed Senate Republicans at a closed-door lunch hosted by Senator Rick Scott, arguing that the party would not face significant political consequences if it allowed ACA premium subsidies to expire. Earlier that year, Bragdon briefed Senate Republicans on proposals to reduce Medicaid spending through work requirements. The organization's June 2025 paper, "House-Proposed Work Requirements Would Protect the Truly Needy, Reduce Dependency, and Grow the Economy," provided congressional staff with arguments supporting the reconciliation bill's Medicaid provisions.

The funding ecosystem sustaining FGA reflects broader conservative philanthropic infrastructure. The Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation provided at least $1.25 million through 2018 for projects on "reducing the welfare state and restoring the working class." Bradley Foundation internal documents noted that FGA worked with the American Legislative Exchange Council and the Secretaries' Innovation Group to advance work requirements and fraud audits. Additional funding flows from Koch network organizations, the Searle Freedom Trust, and individual donors aligned with limited government philosophy.

The Heritage Foundation provides intellectual grounding for work-conditioned benefits that predates FGA's operational focus. Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at Heritage, has advocated for work requirements in welfare programs since before the 1996 welfare reform law. Heritage publications frame work requirements as promoting "self-sufficiency" and reducing "dependency," language that appears throughout state waiver applications and legislative hearings. Heritage Action, the foundation's political arm, mobilizes grassroots conservative support for work requirement legislation.

The American Legislative Exchange Council distributes model legislation through its network of state legislators and corporate sponsors. ALEC convenes annual meetings where legislators from different states share approaches and adopt standardized bill language. Work requirement proposals appearing in multiple states often trace to ALEC model legislation, creating consistency across state implementations that reflects coordinated advocacy rather than independent policy development.

The State Policy Network connects fifty state-level conservative think tanks that localize national arguments. When FGA or Heritage develops arguments for work requirements, State Policy Network affiliates translate those arguments for state-specific contexts, testify before state legislative committees, and provide media commentary supporting work requirement legislation. This network creates the appearance of organic state-level support for policies developed and coordinated nationally.

The cumulative effect of this infrastructure is a policy ecosystem where work requirements moved from philosophical commitment to federal law over two decades. The first Trump administration's encouragement of state waivers reflected advocacy that had prepared the ground. The reconciliation bill's work requirement provisions reflected years of legislative drafting and political groundwork. When FGA celebrates "historic victory," it celebrates the fruition of sustained organizational effort.

## Progressive Opposition Infrastructure

The organizations fighting work requirements operate from different institutional foundations, pursuing different strategies, with different resource bases. Where conservative infrastructure emphasizes policy marketing and state-level implementation, progressive opposition emphasizes research documenting harms, litigation challenging implementation, and coalition-building among affected constituencies.

The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities serves as the primary research counterweight to conservative work requirement advocacy. Founded in 1981 and based in Washington, CBPP analyzes federal and state budget and tax policies with particular attention to effects on low-income populations. On work requirements, CBPP has produced the most comprehensive estimates of coverage losses under various implementation scenarios, documenting that 7 to 14 million people face coverage risk under the reconciliation bill's provisions.

CBPP's research strategy targets both policy debates and media coverage. When congressional committees consider work requirement legislation, CBPP analysis appears in Democratic members' talking points and questions. When journalists cover work requirements, CBPP staff provide expert commentary and data. The organization's estimates of coverage losses shape how work requirements are discussed, framing the policy as coverage restriction rather than workforce promotion. CBPP's November 2025 guide to reducing coverage losses through effective implementation accepts that work requirements will occur while documenting how state choices will determine their impact.

The CBPP model emphasizes rigorous empirical analysis that maintains credibility across ideological audiences. The organization does not frame itself as opposing work requirements philosophically; it frames itself as documenting their effects. This positioning enables CBPP research to appear in mainstream media coverage alongside FGA arguments, creating the appearance of balanced debate between competing empirical claims rather than ideological conflict.

Families USA has pursued consumer advocacy against work requirements through coalition-building and state-level organizing. Founded in 1981, the organization connects health consumer advocates across states and coordinates opposition to coverage restrictions. Families USA's state consumer health advocacy networks provide infrastructure for local opposition to work requirement implementation, organizing testimony at public hearings, media events featuring affected individuals, and legislative contact campaigns.

Community Catalyst builds grassroots capacity to oppose coverage restrictions through state-level organizing. The organization works with community groups serving populations affected by work requirements, helping them participate in policy processes that often exclude non-expert voices. Community Catalyst's approach recognizes that affected populations have limited capacity to engage sustained advocacy, particularly when their members face the daily challenges that Medicaid eligibility itself reflects.

The Kaiser Family Foundation occupies an unusual position in the advocacy ecosystem. Though nonpartisan and not an advocacy organization, KFF research documenting coverage losses provides empirical foundation for opposition arguments. KFF's Medicaid enrollment tracking, waiver analysis, and coverage loss estimates appear throughout the work requirement debate, cited by both progressive advocates and journalists seeking authoritative data. KFF's tracking of Section 1115 waivers provides the most comprehensive public record of state implementation approaches.

The funding ecosystem supporting progressive health advocacy is substantial but differently structured than conservative infrastructure. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, California Endowment, Ford Foundation, and other progressive philanthropies provide grants to CBPP, Families USA, Community Catalyst, and state-level advocacy organizations. However, this funding supports diverse health policy priorities rather than concentrating on work requirements specifically. Conservative funders have invested in work requirements as a priority project for decades; progressive funders have supported organizations that oppose work requirements among many other activities.

This asymmetry matters for implementation battles. FGA can dedicate organizational capacity to work requirements because that is what the organization does. CBPP addresses work requirements alongside tax policy, SNAP, housing, and numerous other issues. The concentration of conservative advocacy resources creates strategic advantages that diffuse progressive opposition cannot match.

## Legal Advocacy Organizations

The distinctive role of litigation in shaping work requirement policy reflects the intersection of legal expertise, strategic coordination, and resource availability. Legal organizations cannot prevent work requirements that Congress has mandated, but they can constrain how states implement those requirements and provide remedies when implementation violates statutory or constitutional requirements.

The National Health Law Program has coordinated legal strategy against work requirements since the first state waiver applications. Founded in 1969 at UCLA as a backup center for legal aid attorneys, NHeLP has become one of the most influential legal organizations in Medicaid history. The organization's attorneys litigate in federal and state courts across the country while providing technical assistance to state legal aid organizations and developing legal theories that structure nationwide litigation strategy.

NHeLP's Health Law Partnerships connect the organization with state-based legal advocacy organizations that bring cases in their jurisdictions. These partnerships combine NHeLP's national expertise in Medicaid law with local organizations' knowledge of state-specific circumstances and affected populations. The partnerships enabled the coordinated litigation that blocked work requirements in Kentucky, Arkansas, New Hampshire, Michigan, and other states, with NHeLP providing legal strategy while state partners provided plaintiffs, local counsel, and on-the-ground knowledge.

The Stewart v. Azar and Gresham v. Azar decisions that struck down work requirement waivers reflected this coordinated strategy. NHeLP worked with the Kentucky Equal Justice Center in Kentucky and with Legal Aid of Arkansas and the Southern Poverty Law Center in Arkansas, developing the legal theory that CMS approval was "arbitrary and capricious" because the Secretary failed to consider coverage effects. Judge Boasberg's repeated holdings that work requirements must be evaluated for their effect on Medicaid's coverage objective established precedent that shaped subsequent litigation.

State legal aid organizations provide the frontline litigation capacity for challenging work requirement implementation. Legal Aid of Arkansas, the Kentucky Equal Justice Center, Michigan Poverty Law Program, and similar organizations in other states identify plaintiffs, develop factual records, and bring cases in federal courts. These organizations operate with severe capacity constraints; legal aid funding has declined relative to need for decades, limiting how many cases can be developed and litigated.

The American Civil Liberties Union involves itself selectively in work requirement litigation where civil liberties framing applies. The ACLU's capacity and visibility provide resources that smaller legal aid organizations cannot match, but the organization addresses work requirements as one issue among many rather than as a priority focus.

Now that work requirements are statutory mandates rather than waiver experiments, litigation strategy shifts. Legal challenges cannot argue that CMS exceeded its authority in approving waivers because work requirements no longer require waiver authority. Instead, litigation will focus on whether state implementation complies with federal statutory requirements, whether implementation violates constitutional due process, and whether specific populations face discrimination that disability rights or civil rights laws prohibit.

NHeLP's "Prepare. Enforce. Protect." initiative reflects this strategic shift. The organization is developing litigation theories, training state partners, and preparing to challenge implementation that violates federal requirements or constitutional protections. The litigation that blocked waiver-based work requirements cannot be replicated against statutory requirements, but new litigation strategies may constrain implementation in ways that protect affected populations.

The threat of litigation shapes state implementation choices even before cases are filed. States aware of Stewart v. Azar precedent may design verification systems and exemption processes to minimize legal vulnerability. Due process protections, accessible verification channels, and good cause exceptions reduce litigation risk while potentially reducing coverage losses. States that proceed aggressively despite litigation risk may face injunctions that delay implementation or judgments that require retroactive coverage restoration.

## Healthcare Industry Stakeholders

The healthcare industry occupies awkward middle ground in work requirement debates. Organizations with economic interests in Medicaid enrollment often hold positions that do not align neatly with ideological camps. This creates potential influence that industry stakeholders have not fully exercised.

Managed care organizations lose members and revenue when Medicaid coverage terminates. MCOs receive capitation payments for enrolled members; fewer members means less revenue. Risk adjustment mechanisms mean that MCOs disproportionately lose revenue when complex, costly members disenroll, as Article 12E documented. The financial case for MCO engagement in coverage maintenance is strong.

But MCOs operate in politically conservative states where overt opposition to work requirements creates contract risk. State Medicaid agencies award MCO contracts and can decline to renew contracts with organizations that oppose state policy priorities. MCO executives attending industry conferences acknowledge work requirement concerns privately while maintaining public neutrality. The result is quiet advocacy for implementation approaches that minimize coverage losses without public opposition to the policy itself.

MCO influence manifests in technical implementation details rather than policy debates. MCOs advocate for verification processes that reduce member burden, exemption frameworks that protect complex populations, and cure periods that provide opportunity to correct documentation failures before coverage terminates. These positions can be framed as operational concerns rather than policy opposition, enabling MCOs to influence implementation without appearing to challenge state priorities.

Hospital associations face similar dynamics with greater urgency in safety-net contexts. Hospitals serving high proportions of Medicaid patients depend on that revenue for operational viability. Rural hospitals and safety-net urban hospitals face particular vulnerability because Medicaid patients represent larger shares of their patient populations. Coverage losses translate directly to uncompensated care increases and potential financial distress.

State hospital associations often advocate for coverage stability without explicitly opposing work requirements. They push for broad exemptions, generous cure periods, and navigation support that maintain enrollment without challenging the underlying policy. This indirect advocacy can influence implementation details while avoiding political conflicts with governors and legislatures that hospital associations need for other purposes.

The American Hospital Association issued statements expressing "concern" about work requirements while stopping short of opposition. AHA's national positioning reflects member hospitals' diverse political environments; hospitals in conservative states cannot have their national association opposing policies their state governments support. The resulting neutrality leaves potential influence on the table that more aggressive engagement might realize.

Provider associations representing physicians, nurses, and other clinicians occasionally deploy professional voice against work requirements on patient care grounds. Medical societies can argue that coverage losses harm patient health without appearing to pursue economic interests. This framing provides cover for advocacy that serves financial interests while presenting as clinical concern. However, provider associations have not made work requirements a priority issue, and their engagement has been sporadic rather than sustained.

Employer groups present complex dynamics. Chambers of commerce and industry associations include members affected by verification requirements that may impose administrative burden on businesses. Employers asked to document employee hours for Medicaid verification face costs and complications they did not seek. Some employer resistance to verification mandates emerges from this operational concern rather than coverage philosophy.

However, employer groups have not organized systematic opposition to work requirements. Most employers are not directly affected; only those employing significant numbers of Medicaid-enrolled workers face verification burden. The affected employers are often small businesses with limited political engagement capacity. Larger employers with political resources typically offer health insurance that makes their employees ineligible for Medicaid. The population of employers with both significant Medicaid workforce presence and political engagement capacity is limited.

## Grassroots Organizations and Affected Populations

The organizations representing people directly affected by work requirements face the most acute capacity constraints. Low-income populations targeted by work requirements lack the resources for sustained political engagement. They are working multiple jobs, managing chronic health conditions, caring for children and aging parents, and navigating the daily challenges that Medicaid eligibility reflects. Attending legislative hearings, participating in advocacy campaigns, and engaging media requires time and resources that affected populations often cannot spare.

Community organizations serving affected populations face strategic dilemmas about engagement. Some adopt pragmatic helper positions, assisting people to comply with requirements regardless of philosophical objections. Others adopt systemic resistance positions, documenting failures and supporting legal challenges while refusing to normalize what they view as unjust policy. Many attempt both simultaneously, helping individuals while fighting the system.

Faith-based organizations serving low-income communities engage work requirements from diverse theological perspectives. Some emphasize unconditional dignity that conflicts with behavioral conditions on healthcare. Others emphasize personal responsibility that aligns with work requirement philosophy. Most focus on practical service rather than policy advocacy, helping people navigate whatever requirements exist rather than challenging those requirements.

Disability rights organizations have particular standing in work requirement debates because exemption frameworks determine whether people with disabilities maintain coverage. Organizations like the National Disability Rights Network, state protection and advocacy agencies, and condition-specific advocacy groups (NAMI for mental illness, The Arc for intellectual disabilities) engage both policy advocacy and individual assistance. Their engagement is essential for ensuring exemption frameworks accommodate the diverse ways disability affects work capacity.

The asymmetry between organizational capacity and affected population size creates representation gaps. Millions of people will face work requirements; thousands participate in advocacy. The voices heard in policy debates come from organizations rather than individuals, and organizational positions may not fully reflect affected populations' diverse circumstances and preferences.

## How Advocacy Shapes State Choices

The advocacy ecosystem's influence on state implementation operates through multiple channels. Direct lobbying shapes legislative choices about statutory frameworks. Technical engagement shapes administrative implementation within those frameworks. Litigation threat shapes risk calculations. Media coverage shapes political perception.

In states where conservative infrastructure is strong and progressive opposition is weak, implementation tends toward enforcement approaches. FGA affiliates testify for rigorous verification while opposition voices are absent or marginalized. Legislators hear arguments for work requirements without systematic presentation of counter-evidence. Administrative implementation reflects the perspectives that dominated legislative debate.

In states where progressive advocacy is organized and capable, implementation negotiations produce more accommodating frameworks. CBPP data appears in legislative testimony. Legal aid organizations' litigation threats shape administrative caution. Exemption categories expand, cure periods extend, and verification processes simplify compared to states where opposition is absent.

Healthcare industry influence operates most effectively when aligned with either advocacy coalition. MCOs advocating for coverage stability alongside progressive advocates reinforce arguments with economic credibility. Hospitals warning about financial consequences of coverage losses add voices that legislators cannot dismiss as ideologically motivated. When industry stays silent, advocacy debates occur between think tanks rather than between economic interests.

The December 2026 implementation will test how advocacy shapes outcomes. States begin from different positions shaped by years of advocacy engagement. The choices made in the next twelve months will reflect the relative strength of competing advocacy ecosystems in each state. Understanding those ecosystems helps predict where implementation will land on the spectrum from permissive to restrictive.

## The Stakes of Asymmetry

The advocacy ecosystem is not a level playing field. Conservative infrastructure has invested in work requirements as a priority project for decades. Progressive opposition addresses work requirements among many priorities with less concentrated resources. Healthcare industry stakeholders have potential influence they have not fully mobilized. Affected populations lack capacity for sustained advocacy regardless of their interests.

This asymmetry has shaped the trajectory from philosophical argument to federal law. FGA's state-by-state advocacy accelerated waiver applications. Heritage's intellectual framework provided arguments that appeared in CMS approval letters. ALEC's model legislation standardized state approaches. The coordinated infrastructure created momentum that diffuse opposition could not match.

The asymmetry will shape implementation debates. FGA is already providing states with implementation guidance emphasizing rigorous verification. CBPP is providing guidance emphasizing coverage protection. States will hear both voices, but they will hear them through different channels with different intensity. Where FGA has cultivated relationships with governors' offices and legislative leadership, CBPP provides research that may or may not reach decision-makers.

Legal advocacy may prove the most effective counterweight because it operates through courts rather than political channels. Litigation does not require winning political debates; it requires winning legal arguments. NHeLP's coordinated litigation strategy succeeded against waivers not because it was more politically powerful than FGA but because it was legally correct about what the Administrative Procedure Act requires. Similar legal strategies may constrain implementation even where political advocacy fails.

The ecosystem will continue evolving. Conservative organizations are pivoting from advocacy for work requirements to advocacy for rigorous implementation. Progressive organizations are pivoting from opposition to harm reduction. Healthcare industry stakeholders face decisions about whether to engage more actively. Legal organizations are developing new theories for the statutory mandate era. The advocacy landscape in 2027 will differ from the landscape in 2025, shaped by implementation experience that does not yet exist.

## Implications for Stakeholders

Understanding the advocacy ecosystem helps stakeholders navigate work requirement politics. Different strategies are appropriate depending on where stakeholders sit in the ecosystem.

States seeking to minimize coverage losses can engage CBPP for implementation guidance, NHeLP for legal review, and MCO partners for operational support. They can design systems that satisfy federal requirements while reducing documentation burden. They can build exemption frameworks that protect vulnerable populations within federal parameters. Understanding that legal advocacy will scrutinize implementation choices may encourage designs that reduce litigation risk.

States seeking rigorous enforcement can engage FGA for implementation guidance and model language. They can design systems emphasizing verification integrity and fraud prevention. They can build exemption frameworks that satisfy federal minimums without expansion. Understanding that legal advocacy may challenge aggressive implementation may shape designs that provide defensible due process.

Healthcare industry stakeholders deciding whether to engage more actively can assess the advocacy landscape in their states. Where organized opposition exists, industry voice can reinforce arguments with economic credibility. Where opposition is absent, industry engagement may be the primary counterweight to enforcement advocacy. The choice to remain neutral has consequences; silence cedes the field to voices that may not serve industry interests.

Affected populations and their advocates face the hardest choices. Resources for sustained advocacy are limited. Every hour spent in legislative hearings is an hour not spent serving affected individuals. The strategic question of whether to help people comply or fight the system has no easy answer. Most will do both, allocating scarce resources across pragmatic assistance and systemic challenge.

The advocacy ecosystem will shape what work requirements mean for 18.5 million expansion adults. The organizations described here will influence whether those people navigate systems designed to maintain coverage or systems designed to enforce compliance. The stakes are not abstract; they are measured in coverage gains and losses, in health outcomes improved or worsened, in lives affected by organizational choices made in policy debates far from the people those debates concern.
