# Article 16D: Media Framing and Public Opinion

## How Americans Understand Work Requirements

*Series 16: Politics and Policy of Work Requirements*

The pollster's question arrived in mailboxes across the country in June 2025, just as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act moved toward final passage. Do you support or oppose requiring Medicaid recipients to work? Sixty-two percent of respondents said yes. A different question, asked days later by a different organization, produced different results. Do you support removing health coverage from people who cannot document that they are working? Forty-eight percent said yes. Both questions described the same policy. The gap between the responses reflected not confusion but something more fundamental: the way an issue is framed shapes what people think about it.

Public opinion on Medicaid work requirements appears solid until you probe beneath the surface. Most Americans believe work requirements are reasonable in principle. Most Americans also believe that taking healthcare away from people is unreasonable. Work requirements are both of these things simultaneously. Whether someone supports or opposes the policy depends substantially on which framing dominates their understanding.

This matters because public opinion shapes political possibility. Legislators who believe their constituents support work requirements feel licensed to pursue aggressive implementation. Legislators who believe their constituents oppose coverage losses feel pressure to build protective systems. The actual policy is the same, but the political environment surrounding implementation differs based on how people understand what the policy does. Media coverage, political messaging, and personal experience all contribute to that understanding.

Article 16A examined why states choose different implementation approaches. Article 16B mapped the advocacy organizations shaping those choices. Article 16E analyzed litigation as a constraint on implementation. This article examines the communication environment surrounding work requirements: how media coverage frames the issue, what public opinion research actually reveals, how competing narratives struggle for dominance, and why the ultimate success of work requirements as political strategy may depend less on whether they work than on whether they are seen to work.

## The Paradox of Public Opinion

Public opinion on Medicaid work requirements contains what appears to be a contradiction. Large majorities express support for work requirements in the abstract while simultaneously expressing opposition to outcomes those requirements produce. This is not cognitive dissonance but rather the predictable result of how opinion research captures different dimensions of a complex issue.

The February 2025 Kaiser Family Foundation Health Tracking Poll found that 62 percent of U.S. adults support requiring nearly all working-age adults on Medicaid to work or look for work. A Paragon Institute poll the same month found even higher support at 84 percent when the question specified "able-bodied adults" and included work, volunteering, or job training as qualifying activities. These numbers appeared to give congressional Republicans a mandate for the requirements they were building into the reconciliation bill.

Yet the same KFF poll found something else. When supporters of work requirements were told that most Medicaid recipients already work, and that documentation requirements could cause many to lose coverage even if working, support dropped from 62 percent to 32 percent. Information changed opinion. The gap revealed that initial support rested on assumptions that empirical evidence contradicted: that Medicaid recipients are predominantly not working, and that work requirements would affect only those who choose not to work.

The Medicaid program itself remains popular across partisan lines. The June 2025 KFF poll found that over 80 percent of adults hold favorable views of Medicaid, including 74 percent of Republicans. Only 17 percent of adults want Congress to decrease Medicaid funding, and this low support for cuts persists even among Trump voters (23 percent favor cuts) and rural residents (21 percent favor cuts). The connection many Americans have to Medicaid grounds their opinions in experience rather than ideology. Over half of adults report that they or a family member has received Medicaid coverage at some point, including 44 percent of Republicans and 45 percent of 2024 Trump voters.

This creates an inherent tension for advocates of aggressive work requirement enforcement. The policy polls well in abstract form. The program it affects polls well in concrete form. Whether public opinion supports or constrains implementation depends on which understanding prevails. If work requirements are understood as reasonable conditions on a welfare program, implementation faces little public resistance. If work requirements are understood as bureaucratic barriers that take healthcare from working people, implementation faces potential backlash.

The malleability of opinion has implications for how the issue is communicated. The same KFF poll that found support dropping when respondents learned that most recipients work also found that support dropped to 40 percent when respondents were told about increased administrative costs for states managing work requirements. Different information produces different opinions. The battle over work requirements is partly a battle over which information reaches the public.

## Episodic and Thematic Frames

Political scientist Shanto Iyengar's research on television news framing offers a framework for understanding how media coverage shapes attribution of responsibility for social problems. Iyengar distinguished between episodic framing, which presents issues through individual cases and specific events, and thematic framing, which presents issues through collective trends and systemic analysis. The framing choice has consequences beyond storytelling style. It shapes whether audiences attribute responsibility to individuals or to society.

When poverty is covered episodically, focusing on an individual who is poor, viewers are more likely to attribute poverty to personal failings: laziness, bad decisions, lack of effort. When poverty is covered thematically, focusing on unemployment rates, wage stagnation, or structural barriers, viewers are more likely to attribute poverty to systemic factors: economic conditions, policy choices, institutional failures. The same social problem, presented differently, produces different understandings of who or what is responsible.

Television news overwhelmingly employs episodic framing. The format rewards human interest, visual storytelling, and narrative arcs with identifiable protagonists. A story about "Maria, who lost her Medicaid coverage" is more compelling television than a story about "aggregate coverage loss statistics." But the episodic frame has political consequences. If Maria's story is presented without systemic context, viewers may conclude that Maria made mistakes that caused her coverage loss. If Maria's story is presented within a framework examining why thousands of people like Maria lost coverage despite meeting requirements, viewers may conclude that the system failed Maria.

Work requirements present this framing challenge acutely. An episodic frame might profile an individual who lost coverage because they didn't report their work hours. Without context, the story implies personal responsibility: she should have reported. With context explaining that the reporting system required internet access she didn't have, that notices arrived at an old address, that her employer wouldn't provide verification documentation, and that 60 percent of those terminated were actually working, the same story implies systemic failure. The woman did not fail to work. The system failed to accommodate how she worked.

Coverage of Arkansas's 2018 work requirements illustrated these dynamics. Early coverage often featured individual cases without systemic analysis. A person lost coverage; presumably they had not met requirements. As research accumulated documenting that most coverage losses involved people who were working or qualified for exemptions, thematic framing became more prominent. Coverage increasingly situated individual stories within evidence of system dysfunction. The shift in framing correlated with a shift in how the policy was understood, from reasonable accountability mechanism to bureaucratic barrier.

The frame that dominates determines which questions seem natural to ask. Under an individual responsibility frame, the natural question is: Why didn't this person comply? Under a systemic frame, the natural question is: Why did this system fail so many people? Implementation that produces visible coverage losses will face media scrutiny. The frame that coverage employs will shape whether that scrutiny focuses on recipient behavior or system design.

## The Racialization of Welfare Frames

Martin Gilens's research on American attitudes toward welfare documented how media coverage racialized poverty in ways that shaped policy attitudes. Analyzing decades of news coverage and public opinion data, Gilens found that Americans don't hate helping the poor. They hate helping the poor they perceive as undeserving. And media portrayals systematically associated poverty with Black Americans while simultaneously associating Black Americans with negative stereotypes about work ethic.

The percentage of poor Americans who are Black has never exceeded 30 percent, yet Gilens found that news coverage consistently overrepresented Black faces in poverty stories. This overrepresentation was not distributed randomly across story types. Sympathetic poverty stories, covering the elderly, rural, or working poor, featured proportionate or underrepresented Black imagery. Unsympathetic stories, covering welfare programs, urban poverty, or dependency concerns, dramatically overrepresented Black subjects. The media's visual vocabulary taught audiences to associate welfare with Black recipients and Black recipients with undeservingness.

These patterns persist. Contemporary coverage of Medicaid work requirements often invokes imagery and language with racial undertones. References to "able-bodied adults" echo historical constructions of the "undeserving poor" that have always carried racial coding. The distinction between "working families" (sympathetic, implicitly white) and "welfare recipients" (suspect, implicitly Black) structures how audiences process information about conditionality.

Conservative media has been explicit in deploying deserving/undeserving frames. Fox News coverage of the reconciliation bill featured commentators arguing that work requirements protect Medicaid by removing "able-bodied, 30-year-old males without dependents" who should be working. Steve Bannon distinguished between the "deserving poor" (U.S. citizens with jobs who voted for Trump) and the "undeserving poor" who should lose benefits. Ben Shapiro told Medicaid recipients to "get off your butt and work." These frames present work requirements as sorting mechanisms separating those who merit help from those who don't.

The reality diverges from the frame. The populations most at risk of coverage loss under work requirements are disproportionately women, many caring for children or elderly relatives in ways that don't count toward hour requirements. They are disproportionately rural, living in areas where formal employment options are scarce. They are disproportionately already working, but in informal, seasonal, or gig arrangements that complicate documentation. The "30-year-old able-bodied male without dependents" who chooses not to work is not the modal case. But the frame persists because it activates moral intuitions about desert and effort that resonate with audiences even when the facts don't support it.

Progressive counter-framing has emphasized that most Medicaid recipients work and that work requirements cause working people to lose coverage. This frame aims to disrupt the association between Medicaid and non-work by centering working families as the affected population. The effectiveness of this counter-frame depends on whether it can penetrate audiences who have been primed by decades of welfare coverage to assume that benefits programs serve people who choose not to work.

## Local Versus National Media Dynamics

National media coverage follows predictable patterns shaped by news cycles, political conflict, and access to expert sources. Local media operates differently. Local reporters cover implementation effects in their communities. They know the regional health systems that depend on Medicaid revenue. They interview neighbors who lose coverage. The episodic framing that characterizes local news produces something national coverage often lacks: specific, named individuals experiencing specific, described consequences.

This creates uneven coverage geography. In states where Medicaid politics are contested, local media have infrastructure to cover implementation. In states where the issue is politically settled, coverage may be sparse until problems become undeniable. Rural areas, where coverage losses may be most severe, often have the least local news capacity to document those losses. The decline of local journalism has created coverage deserts that coincide with healthcare deserts, leaving implementation consequences invisible in communities most affected.

The 2018 Arkansas experience demonstrated how local coverage can shift understanding. Arkansas media covered implementation problems that national outlets initially missed: the online-only reporting portal that excluded people without internet access, the employer verification requirements that many employers refused to complete, the notices sent to old addresses. Local reporting documented that coverage losses concentrated among working people who couldn't navigate bureaucracy, not non-workers who chose not to comply. This reporting informed subsequent litigation and shaped how the policy was remembered.

North Carolina's expansion in 2023 and 2024 generated substantial local coverage examining implementation challenges and enrollment patterns. Local reporters covered enrollment events, interviewed navigators, and documented the gap between policy intent and implementation reality. This coverage created a template for how local media might approach work requirement implementation: focused on specific community impacts rather than abstract policy debates.

Member stories carry particular weight in local contexts. When a local news outlet profiles a resident who lost coverage, the story has geographic and social specificity that national coverage lacks. Viewers may know the employer mentioned, recognize the neighborhood described, or see themselves in the circumstances portrayed. This specificity can humanize policy impacts in ways that aggregate statistics cannot.

Yet member stories carry risks for those who share them. Individuals who describe losing Medicaid coverage may face social stigma, employment consequences, or bureaucratic retaliation. Fear of visibility keeps many affected individuals from telling their stories, creating a silence that coverage-loss narratives struggle to penetrate. Advocacy organizations invest substantially in cultivating relationships with individuals willing to share experiences, but the pool of willing storytellers is smaller than the affected population.

## The Role of Misinformation

The information environment surrounding Medicaid work requirements is not limited to traditional media. Social media platforms circulate claims about work requirements that range from accurate to misleading to false. Some misinformation emerges from misunderstanding; policy complexity creates opportunities for simplification that distorts. Some emerges from strategic messaging that frames policy in ways favorable to particular perspectives.

The February 2025 KFF poll found that 62 percent of U.S. adults incorrectly believe that the majority of working-age adults on Medicaid do not have jobs. In reality, according to 2023 HHS data, 89 percent of non-elderly adult Medicaid enrollees work, and the majority work full time. This misconception is foundational. Support for work requirements rests partly on belief that they will affect a non-working population. When that belief is corrected, support falls substantially.

The misconception is not random. Decades of media coverage framing welfare recipients as non-workers created the belief. Conservative messaging reinforced it. The association between Medicaid and non-work persists even as the Medicaid population has shifted through expansion to include millions of working adults whose employers don't provide insurance. The disconnect between belief and reality creates space for work requirements to appear reasonable when they may not be.

Misinformation also circulates about who is eligible for Medicaid. The February 2025 KFF poll found that 18 percent of adults incorrectly believe undocumented immigrants are eligible for federal health insurance programs (they are not), while 28 percent were unsure. Some Medicaid recipients themselves reported believing that work requirements were targeting undocumented immigrants rather than citizens and legal residents. This misunderstanding, cultivated by political rhetoric linking Medicaid to immigration, obscures who will actually be affected.

Correction of misinformation is difficult. Research on the "continued influence effect" suggests that false beliefs persist even after correction, particularly when the false belief aligns with existing worldviews. Telling someone that most Medicaid recipients work may not change their opinion if their opposition to Medicaid is grounded in broader beliefs about government programs rather than specific facts about recipient work status.

## Psychic Numbing and the Statistics Problem

Psychologist Paul Slovic's research on psychic numbing documents how human emotional response fails to scale with the magnitude of suffering. A single identified individual in crisis evokes strong emotional response and willingness to help. Millions of people facing the same crisis evoke less response, not more. As numbers grow, emotional engagement flattens and then declines. Statistics communicate information but not feeling.

The Congressional Budget Office projected that work requirements under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act will cause 5.3 million more people to become uninsured over ten years. This number appears in policy analysis and news coverage. It fails to move opinion the way a single compelling story might. Five million is too large to comprehend emotionally. It is a fact, not an experience.

Advocacy organizations understand this dynamic. Effective communication about coverage losses centers named individuals with described circumstances rather than aggregate projections. The story of one family losing coverage and facing medical crisis communicates something that 5.3 million cannot. But this creates a tension. Individual stories invite questions about that individual's choices and circumstances. Aggregate statistics resist such questioning but fail to engage emotionally.

The episodic frame that makes stories compelling also makes them vulnerable to individual-responsibility attribution. Thematic framing that emphasizes systemic patterns resists that attribution but sacrifices emotional engagement. Neither approach alone is sufficient. Effective communication likely requires both: individual stories that humanize consequences embedded in thematic analysis that prevents those stories from being dismissed as isolated cases.

The timing of coverage matters. Before implementation, projections are abstract. After implementation, consequences are concrete. Arkansas's work requirements produced coverage losses that became visible and countable. The 18,164 people who lost coverage had names, addresses, and medical needs. Some appeared in news coverage. Some shared stories with advocates and researchers. The abstraction became real.

December 2026 will produce similar concretization. Projections will become enrollment statistics. Some people who lose coverage will become news stories. The question is whether coverage of those stories will be sufficient to shift understanding from the abstract endorsement of work requirements that polls show to the concrete consequences that polls also show people find troubling.

## Competing Narratives and the Battle for Frames

The communication struggle over work requirements involves competing narratives, each with its own protagonists, villains, and moral logic.

The personal responsibility narrative presents work requirements as reasonable expectations that adults should meet. Its protagonists are taxpayers who work hard and resent supporting those who don't. Its implied villains are able-bodied adults who choose dependency over employment. The moral logic is that benefits should be earned, not given, and that conditionality promotes the dignity of work over the degradation of dependency. This narrative has dominated conservative communication for decades and aligns with deep American cultural commitments to individual merit and self-sufficiency.

The coverage protection narrative presents work requirements as bureaucratic barriers that take healthcare from working people. Its protagonists are families working multiple jobs who cannot navigate documentation requirements. Its implied villains are politicians and bureaucrats who create systems designed to fail. The moral logic is that healthcare is too important to depend on paperwork, and that systems should be judged by their effects on vulnerable populations rather than their stated intentions. This narrative challenges the personal responsibility frame by centering working people who lose coverage despite meeting substantive requirements.

The administrative burden narrative presents work requirements as costly and ineffective bureaucracy. Its protagonists are states struggling to implement unworkable mandates. Its implied villains are federal policymakers who impose requirements without funding or infrastructure. The moral logic is that government should be efficient, and that work requirements generate more red tape than behavioral change. This narrative appeals to conservatives skeptical of government competence and to fiscal hawks concerned about implementation costs.

The fraud prevention narrative presents work requirements as necessary guardrails against program abuse. Its protagonists are honest taxpayers and genuinely needy recipients. Its implied villains are fraudsters and freeloaders exploiting system generosity. The moral logic is that identifying and removing ineligible recipients protects resources for those truly in need. This narrative has rhetorical appeal despite evidence that fraud rates in Medicaid are low and that work requirements primarily affect eligible people who struggle with documentation.

Each narrative selects different facts, tells different stories, and produces different policy implications. The dominant narrative in any context shapes what seems reasonable and what seems extreme. Work requirements are either common-sense accountability or mean-spirited bureaucracy depending on which frame structures understanding.

## The Political Function of Ambiguity

The gap between abstract support for work requirements and concrete opposition to coverage losses serves political functions. Legislators can vote for work requirements while claiming they don't want people to lose healthcare. They support the principle while delegating the consequences to state implementation. If implementation causes visible harm, responsibility can be diffused across federal mandates, state choices, and individual compliance failures. No single actor bears full accountability.

This ambiguity enables coalition maintenance. Republican legislators from rural districts where coverage losses will concentrate can support work requirements without confronting constituent impacts directly. They can blame state implementation choices for outcomes they formally endorsed. Democratic legislators in states required to implement can criticize federal mandates while building state systems that produce the outcomes those mandates require. Political credit and blame become separable from policy outcomes.

Media coverage often reinforces this ambiguity by covering policy debates and implementation as separate stories. The political fight over work requirements generates one set of stories. Implementation challenges generate another. Connecting the two, showing that the political choices created the implementation consequences, requires analytical framing that goes beyond event-driven coverage.

## What the Evidence Suggests

The research on media framing and public opinion suggests several dynamics that will shape how work requirements are understood as implementation proceeds.

Initial support for work requirements reflects abstract principles rather than concrete understanding. When people learn more about who Medicaid recipients are and what implementation involves, support declines. The gap between abstract support and informed support creates opportunity for communication that provides information currently missing from public understanding.

How coverage frames implementation will shape responsibility attribution. Episodic coverage focusing on individuals who lose coverage risks individual-responsibility attribution unless embedded in thematic context explaining systemic patterns. Coverage that emphasizes system failures rather than individual failures may generate different public responses.

Racial coding in welfare discourse persists and shapes how audiences process information about work requirements. Communication that disrupts the association between Medicaid and non-work, centering working families as affected populations, challenges the deserving/undeserving frame but must overcome decades of contrary messaging.

Local coverage of implementation consequences may matter more than national coverage for shaping political accountability. Legislators respond to constituent concerns. Coverage that makes implementation consequences visible in specific communities creates political pressure that abstract national debate does not.

The statistics problem means that aggregate coverage loss projections will not move public opinion the way individual stories do. Effective communication requires humanization that aggregate numbers cannot provide. But individual stories invite individual-responsibility attribution that systemic framing resists.

## The Stakes of the Framing Battle

Public understanding of work requirements will shape their political sustainability. If work requirements are understood as reasonable conditions that most people meet, implementation that produces coverage losses will be attributed to individual non-compliance. If work requirements are understood as bureaucratic barriers that working people cannot navigate, implementation that produces coverage losses will be attributed to system failure.

The frame that prevails will shape whether coverage losses produce political backlash or political acceptance. Backlash could lead to pressure for more protective implementation, broader exemptions, or even policy reversal. Acceptance could entrench work requirements as permanent features of Medicaid policy, normalized despite consequences.

For the 18.5 million expansion adults facing work requirements by December 2026, the communication environment is not academic. It shapes whether legislators feel pressure to minimize coverage losses or licensed to accept them. It shapes whether state officials prioritize enrollment protection or compliance enforcement. It shapes whether the policy is seen as working when people keep coverage or working when people lose it.

The battle over frames is a battle over what work requirements mean. That meaning will be constructed through media coverage, political messaging, advocacy communication, and individual experience. The outcome is not predetermined. But understanding the dynamics of framing and opinion helps clarify what is at stake and what is possible as implementation approaches.
