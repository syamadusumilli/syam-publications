# Article 11T: The Attestation Architecture
## Who Must Certify What, For Whom, and How Often

### The Certification Burden

Every exemption, every work hour verification, every accommodation requires someone to attest that something is true. A provider certifies that a patient cannot work. An employer confirms that an employee worked 80 hours. A shelter case manager vouches that a resident is experiencing homelessness. A domestic violence advocate attests to safety concerns without revealing details. These attestations form the evidentiary architecture of work requirement implementation.

The burden of attestation distributes unevenly across the healthcare system, community organizations, employers, and individuals themselves. For the 18.5 million expansion adults subject to work requirements under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, maintaining coverage depends not only on meeting requirements or qualifying for exemptions but on obtaining documentation from people willing and able to certify their circumstances.

This article synthesizes attestation patterns across all populations examined in Series 11, creating a comprehensive map of who must attest to what, under what standards, and how frequently. The analysis reveals that attestation infrastructure represents a hidden implementation challenge: states can design perfect exemption categories, but if the people who must certify those exemptions lack capacity, compensation, or willingness to participate, exemptions remain theoretical rather than functional.

The attestation challenge differs fundamentally from the exemption design challenge. Designing exemption categories requires policy judgment about who should be protected from work requirements. Building attestation infrastructure requires operational judgment about how protection can actually be delivered through documentation that certification sources can feasibly provide.

## Part I: Attestation Types and Their Characteristics

### The Attestation Taxonomy

Attestations required under work requirements fall into distinct categories with different characteristics, different certification sources, and different verification challenges.

**Work Hour Verification** confirms that an individual performed qualifying activities for the required number of hours in a given period. This is the core documentation requirement affecting everyone subject to work requirements who is not exempt. The attestation answers: "Did this person work 80 hours this month?"

**Medical Exemption Attestation** certifies that a health condition prevents an individual from meeting work requirements. This attestation answers: "Can this person work, and if not, why not and for how long?"

**Caregiving Exemption Attestation** confirms that an individual has caregiving responsibilities substantial enough to preclude meeting work requirements. This attestation answers: "Is this person caring for someone who needs care, and does that care consume enough time to justify exemption?"

**Circumstantial Exemption Attestation** certifies that circumstances beyond the individual's control prevent compliance. This includes homelessness, geographic isolation, domestic violence, and similar situations. This attestation answers: "Do this person's circumstances make compliance impossible?"

**Accommodation Request Attestation** documents that an individual needs modified requirements rather than full exemption. This attestation answers: "Can this person work, but not at the standard 80-hour threshold?"

**Self-Attestation** allows individuals to certify their own circumstances when third-party attestation is infeasible, typically under penalty of perjury with elevated audit rates. This attestation answers: "Is this person willing to assert under legal penalty that their claim is true?"

Each attestation type has distinct characteristics regarding who can provide it, what documentation is required, how frequently renewal is needed, and what fraud controls apply.

## Part IV: Attestor Burden Analysis

### Provider Attestation Volume

Healthcare providers bear the heaviest attestation burden. The volume calculation reveals the challenge facing medical practices.

**Estimated annual medical exemption attestations:**
- Population potentially qualifying: 3.7-5.5 million expansion adults (20-30% of 18.5 million)
- Semi-annual renewal doubles documentation: 7.4-11 million attestations annually
- Time per attestation: 15-30 minutes (chart review, assessment, form completion)
- Total provider time: 1.85-5.5 million hours annually

**Distribution across provider types:**
- Primary care physicians: 40-50% of attestations (2.9-5.5 million)
- Psychiatrists/behavioral health: 20-25% (1.5-2.75 million)
- OB/GYN: 5-8% (370,000-880,000)
- Specialists (rheumatology, neurology, pain): 15-20% (1.1-2.2 million)
- Other providers: 10-15% (740,000-1.65 million)

**Burden concentration:**
The burden falls disproportionately on safety-net providers. Federally Qualified Health Centers serve approximately one in six Medicaid beneficiaries. A practice with 2,000 Medicaid expansion adult patients might face 400-600 exemption applications annually, representing 133-200 hours of unfunded provider time.

### Employer Attestation Volume

Employers must verify work hours for expansion adults meeting requirements through employment.

**Estimated annual employer verifications:**
- Expansion adults meeting requirements through work: 9-12 million (50-65% of 18.5 million)
- Monthly verification: 108-144 million employer attestations annually
- Distribution: Large employers (1,000+ employees) handle 30-40% of volume; small employers (under 50 employees) handle 40-50%

**Burden mitigation:**
- Payroll processor integration reduces burden for employers using ADP, Paychex, Gusto
- API connections automate verification for large employers
- Simplified attestation letters reduce documentation complexity for small employers
- MCO verification concierge services consolidate multi-employer documentation

### Community Organization Attestation Volume

Community organizations provide attestations for circumstantial exemptions and trusted intermediary verification.

**Estimated annual community organization attestations:**
- Homelessness: 370,000-550,000 individuals Ã— 4 quarterly attestations = 1.5-2.2 million
- Domestic violence: 350,000-550,000 individuals Ã— 2 semi-annual attestations = 700,000-1.1 million
- Cash economy intermediary verification: 500,000-800,000 individuals Ã— 12 monthly = 6-9.6 million
- Total community organization attestations: 8-13 million annually

**Capacity requirements:**
- Shelter case managers: Current caseloads averaging 30-50 clients; adding 4 attestations per client annually is manageable with streamlined processes
- DV advocates: Current caseloads averaging 20-30 clients; attestation integrated with existing case management
- Community organization intermediaries: New function requiring training, credentialing, and compensation

### Self-Attestation Volume

Self-attestation serves as fallback when third-party attestation is unavailable.

**Estimated annual self-attestations:**
- Cash economy work hours: 500,000-800,000 Ã— 12 monthly = 6-9.6 million
- Job search activities: 300,000-500,000 Ã— 12-52 weekly/monthly = 3.6-26 million
- Confidentiality-protected work verification: 100,000-200,000 Ã— 12 monthly = 1.2-2.4 million
- Total self-attestations: 10-38 million annually

**Fraud control requirements:**
- Standard audit rate: 2-3% of self-attestations
- Elevated audit rate for confidentiality-protected: 15-20%
- Penalty of perjury attestation creates legal deterrent
- Pattern analysis identifies anomalous self-reporting

---

## Part V: Attestation by Population Not Fully Covered in Series 11

The populations identified in Article 11X.DEM as requiring additional analysis also have distinct attestation patterns.

### Veterans

Veterans face dual attestation pathways depending on VA healthcare engagement.

**VA-connected veterans:**
- VA providers can attest to service-connected conditions affecting work capacity
- VA disability ratings provide automatic exemption documentation
- VA treatment records transfer to Medicaid exemption systems with consent

**Non-VA-connected veterans:**
- Standard provider attestation pathways apply
- DD-214 documentation supports veteran status verification but not medical exemption
- Veteran service organizations can facilitate attestation navigation but cannot directly attest

### LGBTQ+ Populations

LGBTQ+ individuals face attestation challenges related to discrimination and confidentiality.

**Medical attestations:**
- Standard provider pathways apply
- Gender-affirming care providers may attest to transition-related work capacity limitations
- Mental health providers attest to discrimination-related mental health conditions

**Confidentiality attestations:**
- LGBTQ+ individuals in hostile environments may need confidentiality protections similar to DV survivors
- Provider attestation without disclosure of sexual orientation or gender identity
- Self-attestation available where provider access creates safety risk

### Immigrant Populations

Immigrant populations face attestation barriers related to documentation status and system avoidance.

**Cash economy attestation:**
- Self-attestation with community organization intermediary verification
- Employer letters accepted without requiring employer tax documentation
- No immigration status verification tied to work requirement attestation

**Mixed-status family attestation:**
- Attestation systems must not require disclosure of family members' immigration status
- Firewall between work requirement verification and immigration enforcement
- Community organization intermediaries can facilitate attestation without immigration risk

### Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities

IDD populations require supported attestation pathways.

**Guardian/representative attestation:**
- Legal guardians can complete attestations on behalf of individuals
- Representative payees for SSI can be authorized for Medicaid attestation
- Supported decision-making allows designated supporters to assist without guardianship

**Simplified attestation:**
- Visual and accessible attestation formats
- Verbal attestation with witness/interpreter
- Provider attestation integrated with regular care visits

### Tribal Populations

Tribal populations have unique attestation pathways through Indian Health Service and tribal governments.

**IHS provider attestation:**
- IHS providers can attest to medical exemptions
- Tribal health programs can attest to circumstantial barriers
- Geographic isolation attestation automatic for reservation addresses

**Tribal government attestation:**
- Tribal employment programs can verify work hours
- Tribal social services can attest to caregiving and circumstantial exemptions
- Sovereignty considerations may limit state access to tribal documentation

### Complex Medical Conditions

Individuals with complex medical conditions requiring intensive treatment have streamlined attestation pathways.

**Treatment-based automatic exemption:**
- Dialysis: Treatment center enrollment triggers automatic exemption; no separate attestation
- Chemotherapy: Oncologist treatment plan documentation provides exemption without repeated attestation
- Organ transplant: Transplant program enrollment triggers exemption

**Duration-based renewal:**
- Cancer treatment: Exemption duration matches treatment protocol plus recovery period
- Post-transplant: Extended exemption during immunosuppression period
- Chronic treatment: Annual attestation for ongoing treatment engagement

### Foster Care Alumni

Young adults aging out of foster care face attestation challenges related to system transition and lack of family support.

**State documentation:**
- Foster care exit documentation provides automatic exemption eligibility for specified period
- State child welfare systems can verify former foster youth status
- Extended foster care program enrollment counts as qualifying activity

**Transition attestation:**
- Grace period after aging out before work requirements apply
- Transition support program enrollment verification
- Self-attestation with elevated support rather than elevated audit

---

## Part VI: The Attestation Infrastructure Gap

### Provider Capacity Constraints

The attestation volume required under work requirements exceeds current provider capacity without system redesign.

**Current constraints:**
- Safety-net providers already understaffed (70%+ of FQHCs report shortages)
- Exemption documentation unfunded (no reimbursement for attestation time)
- EHR systems lack standardized exemption templates
- Provider portals for direct submission not universally available

**Required investments:**
- Provider payment: $35-50 per attestation or equivalent coding allowance
- Template standardization: 5-minute checkbox forms replacing 30-minute letters
- EHR integration: Exemption workflows built into clinical systems
- Training: CME-credited webinars on functional assessment and attestation standards

### Community Organization Capacity Constraints

Community organizations providing circumstantial attestations lack infrastructure for required volume.

**Current constraints:**
- Shelter case managers carrying 30-50 client caseloads
- DV advocates focused on safety planning, not benefits documentation
- No credentialing system for community organization attestors
- No compensation for attestation time

**Required investments:**
- Credentialing infrastructure: State verification of authorized community attestors
- Training: 15-30 minute modules on attestation requirements and fraud prevention
- Compensation: Per-attestation payments or grant funding for attestation capacity
- Technology: Simplified submission portals accessible from shelter and outreach settings

### Employer Cooperation Uncertainty

Employer attestation depends on voluntary cooperation with administrative burden.

**Current constraints:**
- No legal requirement for employers to verify hours
- Small employers lack HR infrastructure for documentation
- Employer concern about liability for attestation errors
- No compensation for employer verification time

**Required investments:**
- Payroll processor partnerships: API connections with major processors
- Simplified attestation templates: One-page employer verification letters
- Liability protection: Safe harbor for good-faith employer attestations
- Employer outreach: Industry association partnerships for small employer support

### Self-Attestation Fraud Control Limitations

Self-attestation requires fraud controls that balance integrity with accessibility.

**Current constraints:**
- Audit capacity limited relative to self-attestation volume
- Pattern analysis requires technology infrastructure not universally available
- Penalty of perjury deterrent requires member understanding of consequences
- Elevated audit rates for confidentiality-protected populations may discourage legitimate claims

**Required investments:**
- Audit infrastructure: Staff and technology for 5-15% audit rates
- Pattern analysis: Algorithms identifying anomalous self-reporting patterns
- Member education: Clear communication about attestation responsibilities and consequences
- Confidential audit protocols: Procedures protecting location while verifying claims

---

## Part VII: Attestation Design Principles

### Principle 1: Minimize Attestation Frequency

Attestation frequency should match the stability of the underlying condition or circumstance.

**Permanent conditions:** Annual attestation maximum; SSI/SSDI receipt eliminates need for separate medical attestation
**Stable chronic conditions:** Annual or semi-annual attestation
**Fluctuating conditions:** Quarterly attestation with crisis provisions for acute episodes
**Temporary circumstances:** Duration-matched attestation with transition grace periods
**Work hours:** Monthly verification simplified through automation and employer integration

### Principle 2: Match Attestor to Circumstance

The attestation source should be the entity with direct knowledge of the relevant facts.

**Medical facts:** Healthcare providers
**Employment facts:** Employers, payroll processors, platform APIs
**Circumstantial facts:** Community organizations with direct service relationships
**Self-known facts:** Self-attestation with appropriate fraud controls

### Principle 3: Simplify Documentation Standards

Attestation should require minimum information necessary for eligibility determination.

**Checkbox forms:** Preferred over narrative letters
**Functional capacity:** Preferred over diagnostic detail
**Enrollment verification:** Preferred over treatment compliance detail
**Hours worked:** Preferred over detailed activity logs

### Principle 4: Provide Alternative Pathways

When primary attestation sources are unavailable, alternative pathways must exist.

**Provider unavailability:** Telehealth attestation, urgent care attestation, community health worker preliminary attestation pending provider confirmation
**Employer non-cooperation:** Self-attestation with pay stub documentation
**Community organization absence:** Self-attestation with elevated audit
**Safety concerns:** Confidential attestation pathways protecting location information

### Principle 5: Compensate Attestors

Unfunded attestation creates capacity bottlenecks and participation resistance.

**Provider payment:** $35-50 per attestation or equivalent billing code
**Community organization compensation:** Per-attestation payment or grant funding
**Employer burden reduction:** Automated verification options reducing manual documentation
**Member support:** Navigation assistance for complex attestation requirements

---

## Conclusion: The Hidden Infrastructure

Work requirements cannot function without attestation infrastructure. States can design perfect exemption categories, but exemptions remain theoretical if the people who must certify eligibility cannot or will not participate. States can establish work hour thresholds, but compliance cannot be verified if employers refuse to document hours and members cannot self-attest without fraud control capacity.

The attestation architecture mapped in this article reveals several critical insights. First, the volume is substantial: 7.4-11 million medical exemption attestations, 108-144 million employer verifications, 8-13 million community organization attestations, and 10-38 million self-attestations annually. This represents billions of dollars in unfunded administrative work distributed across healthcare providers, employers, community organizations, and individuals.

Second, the burden distributes inequitably. Safety-net providers serving Medicaid populations bear disproportionate medical attestation burden. Small employers without HR infrastructure bear disproportionate verification burden. Community organizations serving vulnerable populations bear disproportionate circumstantial attestation burden. The populations least able to navigate attestation requirements depend on the attestors least equipped to provide documentation at scale.

Third, the infrastructure gaps are substantial. Provider payment mechanisms, EHR integration, community organization credentialing, employer API connections, and fraud control capacity all require investment before December 2026 implementation. States that launch work requirements without attestation infrastructure will experience systematic documentation failures that produce coverage loss for individuals who would qualify for exemption or who are meeting work requirements but cannot prove it.

The attestation challenge is not a design problem. It is an operational problem requiring investments in people, technology, and compensation that policy documents alone cannot deliver. States serious about work requirement implementation must build attestation infrastructure with the same attention given to exemption category design and verification threshold establishment. Without that infrastructure, work requirements become documentation requirements, and documentation requirements become coverage barriers for populations unable to navigate attestation systems that don't exist at the scale required.
