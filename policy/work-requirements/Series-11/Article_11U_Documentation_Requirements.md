# Article 11U: The Documentation Architecture
## What Documents Are Actually Required for Redetermination, Work Verification, and Exemption Status

### The Documentation Paradox

Work requirements rest on verification. Members must prove 80 hours monthly of qualifying activities or prove exemption from requirements. Redetermination processes require proof of continuing eligibility. But the populations most needing exemptions and supports often face the greatest documentation barriers. Someone with serious mental illness struggles to maintain organized records. Someone fleeing domestic violence cannot safely provide employer information. Someone working cash economy jobs has no paystubs. Someone with intellectual disability cannot understand what documentation means.

The 18.5 million expansion adults subject to work requirements face monthly work verification, semi-annual redetermination, and exemption documentation cycles that assume capacities many don't possess: literacy, organizational skills, access to technology, stable addresses for receiving mail, relationships with providers willing to complete forms, employers willing to provide verification, and the administrative bandwidth to navigate multi-step processes.

This article maps what documents are actually required across all populations, including those examined in detail in Series 11 and additional populations like veterans, LGBTQ+ individuals, tribal populations, immigrants, foster care alumni, and others whose documentation challenges have received less attention.

## Part I: Work Hour Verification Documentation

### Traditional Employment

**Standard documentation expectations:**
- Pay stubs showing hours worked, pay period dates, employer name
- Employer verification letters on letterhead confirming employment dates and hours
- W-2 forms for annual verification (not useful for monthly tracking)
- Direct API submissions from payroll processors (ADP, Paychex, Gusto) where available

**Small employer accommodations:**
- Simple template letters: fill-in-the-blank forms requiring employee name, hours worked, pay period, signature
- Digital photo submission: employee photographs completed letter,uploads via mobile app
- Two-minute completion target rather than 15-minute formal processes
- Safe harbor protections: employers not liable for good-faith hour reporting errors

**Documentation submission channels:**
- Employer-to-state direct submission (preferred, reduces member burden)
- Member-uploaded paystub photos via mobile app
- Paper mail submission (slowest, creates processing delays)
- Third-party intermediary submission through MCOs or community organizations

### Cash Economy Employment

**The documentation impossibility:**
Cash economy work deliberately avoids formal documentation. Employers pay cash specifically to avoid tax records, payroll systems, and official hour tracking. Requiring standard employment documentation from cash economy workers is structurally impossible.

**Simplified verification alternatives:**
- Self-attestation under penalty of perjury with elevated audit rates (15-20% vs. 5% standard)
- Employer verbal confirmation recorded by community organization intermediary
- Bank deposit records showing regular cash deposits consistent with reported income
- Client attestation for service work (cleaning, childcare, lawn care)
- Photograph of member at workplace with timestamp and location data

**Community organization intermediary verification:**
Organizations trusted in immigrant and cash economy communities can co-sign self-attestations, providing credibility without formal employer documentation. This requires state trust of intermediaries and liability protection for organizations providing good-faith verification.

### Gig Economy and Platform Work

**Platform API integration (where available):**
- Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, Instacart, Amazon Flex can provide direct data feeds
- Earnings reports with hours calculated from platform time stamps
- Automatic monthly submission reducing member burden to zero

**Self-reporting with earnings verification:**
- Member self-reports hours with platform earnings screenshots
- Bank statements showing platform deposits
- 1099 forms (annual, not useful for monthly tracking)
- Earnings-to-hours conversion formulas (state establishes standard rates)

**Multi-platform aggregation challenges:**
Someone working for Uber, DoorDash, and Instacart simultaneously must aggregate hours across platforms. Manual tracking required when platforms don't integrate. Self-reporting with spot verification becomes practical approach.

### Seasonal and Agricultural Work

**Annual averaging documentation:**
- Total hours worked during season verified by employer or farm labor contractor
- Off-season periods documented as zero hours (not non-compliance)
- Hour banking: season hours credited to off-season months
- Industry association verification where individual employer verification difficult

**Specific documentation:**
- H-2A visa documentation (for documented agricultural workers)
- Farm labor contractor attestation covering crews of workers
- Harvest records, planting records, production schedules supporting hour claims
- Self-attestation for day labor with spot verification

### Multiple Part-Time Jobs

**Aggregation requirements:**
Each employer verifies hours separately. Member or state system aggregates to determine total compliance. Documentation burden multiplies with number of employers.

**Practical challenges:**
- One employer submits, others don't: partial compliance documented
- Timing mismatches: one employer reports on time, others late
- Small employer resistance: willing to employ but unwilling to verify
- Job changes mid-month: starting jobs, ending jobs, transitions

**Recommended accommodation:**
Member attests to total hours with spot verification from employers. Random audit requests documentation from employers, but non-response from employer doesn't penalize member if employment was genuine.

### Self-Employment

**The verification paradox:**
Self-employed individuals have no employer to verify hours. Business success may require few hours (efficient) while struggling businesses demand many hours (less income per hour).

**Tax-based verification:**
- Quarterly estimated tax payments prove active business
- Schedule C tax forms show business income (annual)
- Business receipts and invoices document ongoing activity
- Client contracts or service agreements

**Time log self-reporting:**
- Daily hour logs maintained by member
- Monthly submission through portal
- Random audit requests supporting documentation (invoices, emails, receipts)
- 15% audit rate (higher than employment but lower than maximum)

**Client attestation:**
- Service-based businesses can request client verification
- Similar to employer letters but from customers
- Practical for ongoing service relationships
- Impractical for retail or customer-facing businesses

### Education and Training

**Enrollment verification:**
- College/university enrollment letters from registrar
- Attendance records from educational institution
- Credit hour enrollment (converted to time expectations)
- API integration for automatic reporting from institutions

**Qualifying programs:**
- GED programs: class attendance hours
- ESL programs: instructional hours
- Vocational training: program hour requirements
- Job readiness training: workshop hours
- Adult basic education: literacy program hours

**Documentation standards:**
Educational institutions accustomed to verification for financial aid can provide similar verification for work requirements. Automated reporting reduces member burden. Letter on letterhead acceptable for smaller programs without API capacity.

### Volunteer Work

**Organization verification:**
- Volunteer coordinator attestation of hours
- Signed timesheets or attendance logs
- Service activity descriptions
- Organization must be credentialed non-profit or government entity

**Qualifying activities:**
- Community service with non-profits
- Faith-based organization service programs
- Disaster relief volunteering
- Civic participation (coaching youth sports, tutoring)
- Mutual aid and community organizing

**Documentation challenges:**
Small volunteer organizations may lack administrative capacity for monthly verification. Self-attestation with organization co-signature provides practical alternative.

### Job Search Activities

**Documentation requirements:**
- Application confirmations (email receipts, application numbers)
- Interview appointment records
- American Job Center registration
- Workforce development program enrollment
- Online job board search logs

**Hour calculations:**
States must specify: hours per application, hours per interview, hours per job fair attendance. Without standardization, members can't calculate compliance.

**Verification approach:**
Self-reporting with quarterly verification through workforce development system. Random audit of claimed applications contacts employers to verify application was actually submitted.

- Exemption applications available in-language with culturally adapted processes
- Verbal applications with interpreter recorded rather than written
- Visual documentation through photos or videos
- Community organization intermediary submission

**Cash economy intersection:**
LEP populations disproportionately work cash economy. Self-attestation with community organization co-signature provides practical verification when employer won't provide formal documentation.

**Immigration firewall requirements:**
- Explicit guarantee that work requirement documentation not shared with immigration enforcement
- No requirement to disclose family members' immigration status
- Community organization intermediaries when direct submission creates perceived risk

### Veterans

**VA system integration:**
- VA disability ratings provide automatic exemption (30%+ rating)
- DD-214 confirms veteran status
- VA treatment records transferable with consent
- VA providers can attest to service-connected condition limitations

**Non-VA connected veterans:**
Standard documentation pathways apply. Veteran service organizations can facilitate navigation but cannot directly attest without medical credentials.

### LGBTQ+ Populations

**Standard pathways apply, with accommodations:**
- Gender-affirming care providers can attest to transition-related work limitations
- Mental health providers attest to discrimination-related conditions
- Confidentiality protections for individuals in hostile environments
- Provider attestation without disclosing sexual orientation or gender identity

**Specific challenges:**
- Youth kicked out by families lack family documentation

**DACA recipients:**
- Employment authorization document
- Renewals during EAD gaps trigger temporary exemption
- Streamlined verification process

**Asylum seekers:**
- Work authorization showing asylum status
- Language and credential recognition barriers

## Part VI: What Happens When Documentation Is Missing or Incomplete

### Grace Periods and Cure Opportunities

**Before termination:**
- Notice of missing documentation (10 days to respond)
- Reminder notice (if first notice doesn't result in submission)
- Cure period allowing late submission with warning (30 days)
- Coverage continues during cure period

**Progressive enforcement:**
- First missing month: warning only
- Second consecutive month: cure period required
- Third consecutive month: suspension (not termination)
- Fourth month: termination if no response to cure attempts

### Presumptive Eligibility

**During exemption processing:**
- Coverage continues while exemption application pending
- 30-day processing timeline
- Automatic extension if processing takes longer
- Automatic approval if no determination within 60 days

**During redetermination:**
- Coverage continues through redetermination process
- No gap while waiting for documentation
- Presumption of continuing eligibility unless proven otherwise

### Appeals and Fair Hearings

**Documentation for appeals:**
- Denial notice explains reason
- Member has 90 days to file appeal
- Coverage continues during appeal
- Member can submit additional documentation during appeal

**Burden of proof:**
- For exemptions: member must prove qualification
- For work hour verification: member must prove compliance
- For redetermination: state must prove ineligibility change
- Medical exemptions reviewed by independent medical professional

### Retroactive Corrections

**When documentation proves past eligibility:**
- Coverage restored retroactively
- Claims reprocessed
- Member not liable for services received during gap
- Provider reimbursement for previously denied claims

**Common retroactive scenarios:**
- Employer verification submitted late but proves hours were worked
- Medical exemption documentation confirms condition existed during coverage gap
- System error caused incorrect determination
- Documentation was submitted but lost or misfiled

---

## Part VII: Reducing Documentation Burden Through System Design

### Automatic Data Matching

**Existing data sources:**
- SSI/SSDI receipt (Social Security Administration)
- Incarceration status (justice system data)
- Unemployment benefits (state workforce agencies)
- Large employer payroll (with consent/participation)
- Educational enrollment (participating institutions)
- Hospitalization claims (Medicaid data)

**Benefit:**
Automatic data matching eliminates need for member to provide documentation. Exemptions and verification happen without member action.

### Continuous Eligibility

**Annual redetermination (instead of semi-annual):**
- Reduces documentation frequency
- Provides stability for members with stable circumstances
- Less administrative burden for state and member
- Standard for SSI/SSDI Medicaid populations

**Multi-year periods for permanent conditions:**
- Permanent disability should not require annual renewal
- Conditions unlikely to improve require less frequent documentation
- Balance between accuracy and burden

### Simplified Attestation

**Self-attestation with spot verification:**
- Member attests to circumstances
- Random audit sample (2-3% to 15-20% depending on attestation type)
- Penalty of perjury creates legal deterrent
- Reduces universal documentation burden

**Provider checkbox forms:**

- Completion time under 5 minutes
- EHR integration enabling in-visit completion

### Community Organization Intermediaries

**Credentialed intermediaries:**
- Organizations serving specific populations
- Trained staff authorized to submit on member behalf
- Member consent required
- Audit trail maintained

**Benefits:**
- Reaches populations avoiding direct government contact
- Provides navigation support
- Ensures completeness
- Culturally appropriate service delivery

## Conclusion: The Documentation Burden's Invisible Weight

Documentation requirements appear neutral on their face. Request standard employment verification. Provide medical attestation. Submit address proof. Simple administrative necessities.

But documentation burden falls unevenly. People with stable employment at large companies with digital payroll systems face minimal burden. Their hours automatically verify. People working cash economy jobs must self-attest. People with serious mental illness must organize during psychiatric crises. People fleeing domestic violence must choose between coverage and safety.

The populations examined across Series 11 share common documentation barriers: conditions preventing organization, circumstances preventing standard proof, trauma preventing system navigation, isolation preventing information access, language preventing comprehension, poverty preventing technology access, discrimination preventing employer cooperation.

Effective documentation systems acknowledge these realities through automatic exemptions reducing application burden, simplified attestation replacing extensive documentation, multiple submission channels accommodating access barriers, grace periods allowing late submission, presumptive eligibility preventing coverage gaps, community intermediaries providing navigation support, and technology integration enabling automation.

The alternative is what Arkansas experienced in 2018: 25% coverage loss when only 3-4% were actually ineligible. The majority of loss came from documentation failure, not actual ineligibility. When work requirements with intensive documentation launched, 18,000 people lost coverage. Most were working or qualified for exemptions. They simply couldn't navigate documentation processes designed without understanding their lives.

December 2026 approaches. States implementing work requirements choose documentation architectures now. The choices made about what documents are required, how they're submitted, what accommodations exist, and how missing documentation is handled will determine whether 18.5 million expansion adults maintain coverage while meeting requirements or lose coverage despite compliance.
