## Work Requirement History

Arkansas holds the distinction of being the first state to implement Medicaid work requirements and the first to generate definitive evidence of their harmful effects. The 2018-2019 experience produced the most comprehensive research on work requirement implementation and became the foundation for subsequent litigation nationwide.

**Arkansas Works: The First Implementation**

In June 2018, Arkansas became the first state to implement work requirements for Medicaid beneficiaries. The program, called "Arkansas Works," required adults ages 30-49 to document 80 hours monthly of work, community engagement activities, or exemption status. The age range was scheduled to expand to include adults 19-29 in January 2019.

The policy design contained several features that later proved catastrophic:

*Online-Only Reporting:* Initially, beneficiaries could only report compliance through an online portal. In a state where 41% of the population lives in rural areas and many lack reliable internet access, this requirement created an immediate barrier. Phone reporting was added in mid-December 2018, but only after thousands had already lost coverage.

*Monthly Deadlines:* Beneficiaries had until the 5th of the following month to report their prior month's hours. Missing three reporting deadlines in a calendar year resulted in coverage termination.

*Limited Exemption Awareness:* While exemptions existed for disability, caregiving, and other circumstances, many who qualified for exemptions were unaware of them or unable to document them.

**Coverage Losses**

Over seven months of implementation (June 2018 through March 2019), 18,164 adults lost Medicaid coverage for failure to meet work reporting requirements. This represented nearly one in four of those subject to the requirements.

Research conducted by Benjamin Sommers and colleagues at Harvard documented what actually happened:

- 95% of those terminated were either working or qualified for exemptions
- 97% of terminations were for failure to report, not failure to work
- One-third of those subject to requirements had never heard of them
- More than half of those who knew about the requirements were confused about how to comply
- Among those ages 30-49, uninsured rates increased from 10.5% to 14.5%
- No increase in employment was detected over 18 months of follow-up
- Those who lost coverage experienced serious consequences: 50% reported problems paying medical debt, 56% delayed care due to cost, 64% reported problems affording prescriptions

**Health Consequences**

The research documented concrete harm from coverage loss:

- People who lost coverage experienced significant increases in medical debt
- Delayed care became common among the disenrolled
- Medication affordability problems emerged immediately
- No health benefits were documented from the work requirement
- No employment gains offset the coverage losses

**Gresham v. Azar: The Legal Halt**

In March 2019, a federal district court vacated CMS's approval of Arkansas Works. Judge James Boasberg found that the Department of Health and Human Services had failed to consider whether work requirements would further Medicaid's core objective of providing health coverage to low-income populations. The court determined that CMS had not adequately addressed the program's predictable effect of causing coverage losses.

The same judge simultaneously struck down a similar Kentucky waiver that had not yet been implemented. The legal principle established in these cases formed the basis for subsequent challenges to work requirements in other states.

**Research Legacy**

Arkansas's implementation generated the most robust evidence base on work requirement effects:

- Sommers et al. published results in the *New England Journal of Medicine* (2019) and *Health Affairs* (2020)
- The Kaiser Family Foundation documented monthly enrollment and termination data
- The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities synthesized findings across states
- Georgetown University's Center for Children and Families provided ongoing analysis

This research demonstrated definitively that the Arkansas approach caused coverage loss without producing employment gains. The findings became central to policy debates about whether work requirements could ever be designed to avoid these harms.

## Current Policy and Waiver Status

**Pathway to Prosperity: The 2025 Application**

On January 28, 2025, Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders submitted a new Section 1115 waiver amendment requesting work requirements for the ARHOME population. The proposal, titled "Pathway to Prosperity," explicitly incorporates lessons from the 2018-2019 failure.

Key design changes from Arkansas Works:

*Suspension Rather Than Termination:* Individuals who fail to comply with requirements would have benefits suspended, not terminated. They would remain enrolled in Medicaid and could have benefits restored by indicating intention to cooperate with program requirements. This addresses the court's concern about coverage losses while maintaining work-related incentives.

*No Monthly Hour Threshold:* Unlike Arkansas Works (and unlike the federal 80-hour requirement), Pathway to Prosperity does not prescribe specific monthly hours. Instead, it focuses on "Personal Development Plans" intended to increase wages and hours worked over time.

*Data Matching Instead of Self-Reporting:* Rather than requiring beneficiaries to log into a portal to document work hours, the state proposes using administrative data matching and periodic audits. The burden of verification shifts from the individual to the state.

*Success Coaching:* The proposal includes "Success Coaching" with focused care coordination to connect unemployed individuals with resources such as career training and transportation. This acknowledges that many people need support to find and maintain employment, not just mandates to work.

*Broader Exemptions:* The new proposal includes exemptions for age, pregnancy, medical frailty, caregiver status, student status, unemployment benefits receipt, and substance use disorder treatment.

**Legislative Activity**

Senate Bill 527, passed by a state Senate committee in April 2025, amends state law to align with the waiver request. The bill specifies that noncompliance results in suspension rather than disenrollment and requires participants to provide information demonstrating compliance.

**Federal Coordination**

Arkansas submitted its waiver before the One Big Beautiful Bill Act established federal work requirements effective December 2026. State officials have indicated they do not plan to withdraw the waiver and will work to ensure Pathway to Prosperity aligns with federal requirements.

The federal requirement specifies 80 hours monthly, while Arkansas's proposal does not prescribe specific hours. How these will be reconciled remains unclear. The state may need to modify its approach or seek additional flexibility.

**Cost Projections**

The state estimates Pathway to Prosperity will cost $42.8 million over five years. Savings would come from suspended benefits and from individuals who leave Medicaid due to increased income. The state projects $122.8 million in savings over five years, though these projections depend on assumptions about behavioral responses that the 2018-2019 evidence does not support.

## Defining Characteristics

**The Definitive Cautionary Tale**

Arkansas's 2018-2019 implementation remains the most important reference point for understanding what happens when work requirements are implemented without adequate safeguards. The 18,164 coverage losses, the research documenting that most were working or exempt, and the absence of any employment gains established the empirical foundation for skepticism about work requirements.

Any state implementing work requirements must grapple with what Arkansas demonstrated:

- Administrative barriers, not work failure, drove coverage losses
- Populations subject to requirements were already largely working or legitimately unable to work
- Online-only reporting in populations with limited internet access creates impossible compliance
- Confusion about requirements and exemptions is pervasive
- Coverage loss causes measurable health harm without producing offsetting benefits

**Private Option Heritage**

Arkansas has never operated a traditional Medicaid expansion. Since 2014, the state has used Medicaid funds to purchase private insurance for expansion adults through the health insurance marketplace. This "private option" approach (now called ARHOME) means beneficiaries have private insurance cards and access private provider networks.

This structure affects work requirement implementation:

- Benefits are managed through Qualified Health Plans (QHPs), not traditional Medicaid
- Suspension of benefits means the state stops making premium payments to QHPs
- The infrastructure for tracking eligibility involves both Medicaid and marketplace systems
- Some analyses of ARHOME's effects may not generalize to traditional Medicaid expansion states

**Delta Region Challenges**

The Mississippi Delta region of eastern Arkansas presents extreme implementation challenges. These counties have the highest poverty rates, largest Black populations, most severe health outcomes, and least infrastructure. Eight of eleven counties with the worst health outcomes in Arkansas are in the Delta.

Work requirements in the Delta face structural barriers:

- Limited employment opportunities as major employers have left
- Transportation barriers in areas with no public transit
- Healthcare workforce shortages (many counties lack specialists)
- Educational attainment gaps limiting employment options
- Historical disinvestment creating compounding disadvantage

**Substance Use Disorder Concentration**

Arkansas's opioid and methamphetamine crisis directly affects work requirement implementation:

- The state has the second-highest opioid prescription rate nationally
- Methamphetamine use is 40% above national average
- Only four counties have opioid treatment programs
- SUD treatment is increasingly combined with fentanyl use
- Maternal mortality related to substance use is the highest in the nation

People with active substance use disorders are precisely the population most likely to struggle with compliance requirements. Whether the SUD treatment exemption will be accessible in practice, given the state's treatment infrastructure limitations, remains a critical question.

## Expected Policy Posture and Timeline

**Anticipated Approach: Modified Enforcement**

Arkansas's 2025 proposal represents a middle path between its failed 2018 enforcement approach and the zero-friction model Georgia has moved toward. The key features suggest:

*More Support, Less Punishment:* Success Coaching and Personal Development Plans indicate recognition that people need help finding work, not just mandates. This shifts the framing from enforcement to enablement.

*Suspension as Softer Consequence:* Keeping people enrolled in Medicaid but suspending benefits creates a different incentive structure than termination. People can regain coverage without reapplying, reducing the consequences of noncompliance.

*Data Matching as Burden Reduction:* Using administrative data rather than self-reporting addresses the primary failure mode from 2018. If the state can verify work through unemployment insurance data, employer records, or other sources, many beneficiaries may never need to take any action.

**Timeline**

- January 2025: Waiver submitted
- February 2025: Public comment period and hearings
- April 2025: State legislation passed (SB 527)
- 2025: CMS review and potential approval
- January 2026: State target for implementation (ahead of federal deadline)
- December 2026: Federal work requirement deadline

Arkansas is seeking to implement one year before the federal deadline, positioning itself again as a leader in work requirement implementation.

**Key Uncertainties**

*Alignment with Federal Requirements:* The federal 80-hour monthly threshold differs from Arkansas's personal development plan approach. Whether CMS will approve Arkansas's alternative design or require modification is unclear.

*Implementation Capacity:* State Medicaid Director Janet Mann acknowledged uncertainty about how many people will be affected and which organizations will provide Success Coaching. Building implementation infrastructure by January 2026 is ambitious.

*Legal Challenges:* The legal aid attorneys who successfully challenged Arkansas Works in 2019 have signaled concern about the new proposal. Whether similar litigation will emerge depends on implementation details and outcomes.

## Summary: What Arkansas Is Expected to Do

Arkansas will implement work requirements in 2026, likely before the federal deadline, using a design substantially modified from its 2018 failure. The Pathway to Prosperity proposal attempts to address known failure points: suspension rather than termination, data matching rather than self-reporting, Success Coaching rather than pure enforcement.

Whether these modifications will prevent the coverage losses that occurred in 2018-2019 depends on implementation quality. The research from the first attempt demonstrated that most people subject to requirements were already working or legitimately exempt. If that remains true, the question becomes whether the new design can avoid documentation barriers that caused the previous coverage losses.

**The Critical Test**

Arkansas's second attempt represents the most important test case for work requirement design. If Pathway to Prosperity succeeds where Arkansas Works failed, it would demonstrate that work requirements can be implemented without mass coverage losses. If it fails again, despite the design modifications, it would suggest that work requirements are fundamentally incompatible with maintaining coverage for vulnerable populations.

The stakes extend beyond Arkansas. CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz has pointed to work requirements as a model for states that want to roll back Medicaid expansion. If Arkansas demonstrates that a "kinder, gentler" work requirement still causes coverage losses, the policy's future becomes more uncertain. If it succeeds, other states will adopt similar designs.

**Lessons for Federal Implementation**

Arkansas's experience offers several lessons for the December 2026 federal mandate:

*Documentation Barriers Cause Most Failures:* People lost coverage not because they weren't working but because they couldn't prove it. Any system that depends on individual documentation will face this challenge. The federal requirement's emphasis on verification creates the same risk.

*Confusion Is Pervasive:* One-third of those subject to requirements didn't know they existed. Robust outreach and communication are prerequisites for any compliance expectation. States have 14 months to educate 18.5 million people about new requirements.

*Employment Effects Are Minimal:* The research found no employment gains from work requirements. States and CMS expecting increased workforce participation may be disappointed. The policy may function as coverage reduction rather than employment promotion.

*Health Consequences Are Real:* Coverage loss produces medical debt, delayed care, and medication access problems. These harms occur regardless of whether the policy achieves its stated goals. The question becomes whether such harms are acceptable costs of the policy's objectives.

*Geographic Concentration of Harm:* Coverage losses in Arkansas concentrated in the Delta region, where poverty, minority populations, and health challenges were already most severe. Work requirements may exacerbate rather than address geographic health disparities.

Arkansas cannot escape its history. The state that produced 18,164 coverage losses will be scrutinized closely as it attempts a second implementation. Whether Pathway to Prosperity represents genuine learning or rhetorical repositioning will be determined by outcomes, not design documents. The research community that documented the first failure will be watching the second attempt equally closely.

## Cross-Program Context

**SNAP ABAWD Requirements**

Arkansas operates Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Able-Bodied Adults Without Dependents (ABAWD) work requirements for a similar population. Coordination between SNAP and Medicaid work requirements could reduce duplication but also compounds the compliance burden for people subject to both.

**TANF Work Requirements**

Arkansas's Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program includes work requirements, though it serves a different population (primarily families with children receiving cash assistance). The state has experience administering work requirements but in a different program context.

**Rural Hospital Challenges**

Arkansas's rural hospital infrastructure is strained. If work requirements cause significant coverage losses in rural areas, hospitals serving those populations will face increased uncompensated care. The Delta region, already experiencing hospital closures and service reductions, is particularly vulnerable.

**Marketplace Integration**

ARHOME's private option structure means beneficiaries are already connected to marketplace plans. If people lose Medicaid eligibility, they may be able to transition to marketplace coverage with subsidies, though this depends on income levels and whether enhanced ACA subsidies are maintained.
