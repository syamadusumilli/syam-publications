**Series 14: State Implementation of Work Requirements**

**Word Count Target:** 2,500-3,000 words

## State Profile

**Demographics**

Tennessee presents a unique situation in the work requirements landscape: the state never accepted Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. This means Tennessee has no expansion adult population subject to the federal work requirement mandate. The paradox is that Tennessee has been among the most vocal proponents of work requirements for a population it does not have.

- Traditional Medicaid population: approximately 1.4 million (children, pregnant women, elderly, disabled)
- Adults in coverage gap (too much income for traditional Medicaid, too little for marketplace subsidies): approximately 120,000-150,000
- These coverage gap adults have no Medicaid coverage and thus no work requirements apply
- If Tennessee expanded: estimated 200,000-250,000 adults would gain coverage

**Geographic Characteristics**

- 95 counties with significant variation between metropolitan and rural
- Memphis metro (Shelby County): approximately 13% of state population, significant poverty concentration
- Nashville metro (Davidson and surrounding): approximately 25% of state population, economic growth center
- Knoxville and Chattanooga: secondary urban concentrations
- Appalachian eastern Tennessee: 26 counties designated Appalachian
- Rural middle and west Tennessee: agricultural economy, limited healthcare infrastructure
- Approximately 34% of population lives in rural areas

**Special Population Concentrations**

- Significant opioid epidemic impact; Tennessee ranks top ten nationally for overdose deaths
- Appalachian population in eastern counties facing economic challenges similar to Kentucky
- Memphis Black population concentration (approximately 64% of city population)
- Agricultural workforce in western Tennessee (cotton, soybeans)
- Automotive manufacturing workforce in middle Tennessee (Nissan, GM suppliers)
- Growing Hispanic/Latino population, concentrated in Nashville and meatpacking regions
- Limited tribal population

**Economic Context**

- State unemployment rate: approximately 3.5-4.0%
- Major industries: healthcare (HCA headquarters in Nashville), automotive manufacturing, logistics, music/entertainment
- Nashville among fastest-growing metropolitan economies nationally
- Memphis logistics hub (FedEx headquarters)
- Significant economic disparity between growing Nashville metro and struggling rural regions
- State minimum wage follows federal floor ($7.25)
- No state income tax

## The Non-Expansion Reality

**Why Tennessee Matters Despite No Expansion**

Tennessee's inclusion in a series about work requirement implementation requires explanation. The state has no Medicaid expansion population. Federal work requirements under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act apply only to expansion adults. Tennessee therefore faces no federal work requirement mandate.

Yet Tennessee merits attention for several reasons:

*Block Grant Pursuit:* Tennessee has aggressively pursued Medicaid restructuring through block grant proposals that would include work requirements for traditional Medicaid populations beyond what federal law mandates. Understanding Tennessee's approach illuminates the ideological commitments driving work requirement policy.

*TennCare History:* Tennessee's Medicaid program, TennCare, was the first statewide Medicaid managed care program (1994) and has been a laboratory for Medicaid policy innovation and controversy for three decades. The state's approach to program design influences national discussions.

*Future Expansion Possibility:* If Tennessee ever accepts Medicaid expansion (several failed legislative attempts have occurred), work requirements would apply. Understanding the state's likely approach to implementation matters for contingency planning.

*Regional Influence:* Tennessee's policy positions influence neighboring states. As a conservative Southern state that has resisted expansion, Tennessee's approach signals what other non-expansion states might pursue.

**The Coverage Gap Population**

Approximately 120,000-150,000 Tennesseans fall into the coverage gap: their income exceeds traditional Medicaid eligibility limits but falls below the poverty level threshold for marketplace subsidies. These individuals have no affordable coverage option.

If Tennessee expanded Medicaid, this population plus others would gain coverage. Work requirements would then apply. The coverage gap population provides the closest approximation to who Tennessee's expansion population would be:

- Predominantly working adults in low-wage jobs without employer coverage
- Concentrated in rural areas where employer-sponsored coverage is less common
- Significant representation in service, retail, and agricultural sectors
- Disproportionately affected by the opioid epidemic
- Higher rates of chronic conditions due to lack of preventive care

## Work Requirement History

**Block Grant Proposal: TennCare III**

In November 2019, Governor Bill Lee submitted the TennCare III waiver proposal to CMS. Unlike typical Section 1115 waivers, TennCare III proposed converting Tennessee's entire Medicaid program to a block grant, receiving a fixed federal payment rather than open-ended matching funds.

The proposal included work requirements as a component:

*Community Engagement Requirement:* Adults ages 19-64 in the traditional Medicaid population (not just expansion adults, which Tennessee doesn't have) would face work or community engagement requirements.

*Scope Beyond Federal Mandate:* The proposal would apply work requirements to parents receiving Medicaid, adults with disabilities not receiving SSI, and other traditional Medicaid categories that the OB3 federal mandate exempts.

*Enforcement Through Premium Increases:* Non-compliance would result in increased cost-sharing rather than coverage termination, a design choice reflecting lessons from Arkansas and Kentucky failures.

**Trump Administration Approval**

CMS approved TennCare III in January 2021, in the final days of the first Trump administration. The approval was unprecedented: no state had received block grant authority, and extending work requirements to traditional Medicaid populations exceeded what any other state had attempted.

**Biden Administration Withdrawal**

The Biden administration withdrew approval of TennCare III in December 2021, determining that the block grant structure did not further Medicaid objectives. Tennessee sued, but the litigation became moot when the state did not pursue implementation during the Biden years.

**Current Status Under Second Trump Administration**

With the return of a Republican administration in 2025, Tennessee has renewed its block grant pursuit. The state resubmitted TennCare III with modifications in early 2025, seeking to become the first state operating Medicaid under block grant authority with work requirements for traditional populations.

## Current Policy and Waiver Status

**TennCare III Resubmission**

Tennessee resubmitted its TennCare III block grant waiver in February 2025. The proposal includes:

*Block Grant Financing:* Tennessee would receive a fixed federal payment based on historical spending plus adjustments, rather than open-ended matching. The state accepts financial risk for enrollment and cost increases in exchange for regulatory flexibility.

*Work Requirements for Traditional Medicaid:* The resubmitted proposal extends community engagement requirements to:
- Parents and caretaker relatives receiving Medicaid
- Adults ages 19-64 not otherwise exempt
- Certain adults with disabilities who do not receive SSI

*Exemption Structure:* Exemptions would cover pregnancy, SSI disability recipients, children, elderly, individuals in SUD treatment, primary caregivers of dependents with disabilities, and residents of counties with unemployment rates exceeding 150% of state average.

*Graduated Consequences:* Rather than immediate coverage termination, Tennessee proposes graduated consequences: increased premiums for initial non-compliance, benefit reductions for continued non-compliance, and disenrollment only after extended non-compliance with multiple intervention attempts.

**CMS Review**

The second Trump administration has indicated support for block grant concepts, though no state has yet received approval under the current administration. Tennessee's application is under active review.

**Legislative Context**

Tennessee's Republican supermajority legislature has consistently supported work requirements and block grant approaches. Multiple Medicaid expansion proposals have failed; the legislature prefers restructuring existing Medicaid to expanding it. Governor Lee has made TennCare III a priority.

## Defining Characteristics

**The Block Grant Distinction**

Tennessee's defining characteristic is pursuing work requirements through block grant restructuring rather than standard Section 1115 waiver authority. This approach differs from other states in fundamental ways:

*Financial Risk Transfer:* Under a block grant, Tennessee accepts risk that enrollment or costs might exceed the fixed federal payment. This creates incentives to limit enrollment that don't exist under standard matching. Work requirements become not just policy preference but financial management tool.

*Regulatory Flexibility:* Block grant authority could allow Tennessee to implement requirements that standard Medicaid rules prohibit. The state seeks freedom to design programs without the constraints other states face.

*Precedent Setting:* No state has operated Medicaid under block grant authority. Tennessee would establish precedent that other states could follow, potentially transforming Medicaid nationally.

**TennCare Managed Care Heritage**

Tennessee pioneered statewide Medicaid managed care in 1994. TennCare was ambitious, troubled, and ultimately transformed. The history shapes current implementation capacity:

*Administrative Experience:* Tennessee has operated managed care for thirty years. The administrative infrastructure for complex program requirements exists.

*MCO Relationships:* Three MCOs serve TennCare: BlueCare Tennessee (BlueCross BlueShield), Amerigroup Tennessee (Elevance), and UnitedHealthcare Community Plan. These MCOs have deep experience with Tennessee's population.

*Prior Crisis Experience:* TennCare faced near-collapse in the mid-2000s, with enrollment cuts and benefit reductions. The state has experience managing program contraction, which block grant risk management might require.

*Mature Care Coordination:* Tennessee's MCOs have developed care coordination capacity over decades. This infrastructure could support work requirement compliance assistance.

**Geographic Divide**

Tennessee's geography creates implementation complexity even for traditional Medicaid populations:

*Nashville Prosperity:* The Nashville metropolitan area is among the fastest-growing economies nationally. Employment opportunities are plentiful; labor shortages exist in many sectors. Work requirements in Nashville would face different dynamics than work requirements in Appalachian eastern Tennessee.

*Memphis Challenges:* Memphis faces persistent poverty, particularly in majority-Black neighborhoods. The city's economic challenges differ from Nashville's growth. Work requirements would interact with concentrated urban poverty.

*Appalachian Tennessee:* The 26 Appalachian counties face circumstances similar to eastern Kentucky: limited employment, transportation barriers, opioid epidemic, healthcare access challenges. Requiring work in communities without jobs raises the same questions Kentucky faces.

*Rural Middle and West Tennessee:* Agricultural communities have seasonal employment patterns and limited service infrastructure. Work requirement verification in these regions requires different approaches than urban implementation.

**The Traditional Population Question**

Tennessee's proposal to extend work requirements to traditional Medicaid populations raises distinct issues:

*Parents and Caregivers:* Traditional Medicaid covers parents with income below approximately 100% FPL (varies by family size). These are working parents whose income is low despite employment. Requiring additional work documentation from people already working creates administrative burden without addressing actual employment.

*Adults with Disabilities:* Tennessee proposes including some disabled adults who don't receive SSI. This population may have work capacity limitations that don't meet SSI disability thresholds but still impair full-time employment. Where the line falls between "can work with accommodations" and "cannot work at all" becomes contested.

*Children's Coverage Implications:* Parents losing coverage affects children. If a parent loses Medicaid for work requirement non-compliance, the parent may disengage from systems that maintain children's coverage. Family coverage continuity becomes more complex.

## Expected Policy Posture and Timeline

**Anticipated Approach: Aggressive Restructuring**

Tennessee's expected approach is the most aggressive of any state: pursuing block grant authority that no state has received, extending work requirements to populations other states exempt, and accepting financial risk other states avoid.

Several factors drive this posture:

*Ideological Commitment:* Tennessee's political leadership views work requirements as principled policy, not just administrative tool. The commitment reflects beliefs about reciprocal obligation and program design.

*Fiscal Motivation:* Block grant authority with work requirements could reduce state Medicaid spending if enrollment declines and federal payments remain fixed. The financial incentives align with policy preferences.

*Federal Alignment:* The second Trump administration's support for state flexibility and work requirements creates opportunity Tennessee has awaited.

*No Expansion Population:* Since Tennessee has no expansion adults, federal work requirement mandates don't apply. The state's pursuit of work requirements for traditional populations is entirely voluntary.

**Timeline**

- February 2025: TennCare III resubmitted
- Spring-Summer 2025: CMS review and negotiation
- Fall 2025: Potential approval (unprecedented)
- 2026: Implementation if approved
- December 2026: Federal work requirement deadline (not applicable to Tennessee absent expansion)

**Key Uncertainties**

*Block Grant Approval:* Whether any administration will approve true block grant authority remains uncertain. Tennessee's proposal tests boundaries no state has successfully crossed.

*Legal Challenges:* Advocacy organizations will likely challenge block grant approval as exceeding statutory authority. Litigation could delay or prevent implementation.

*Expansion Politics:* Tennessee's hospital association and some business groups support Medicaid expansion. If expansion occurs (unlikely under current leadership), federal work requirements would apply and Tennessee's implementation approach would matter.

*Traditional Population Outcomes:* If Tennessee implements work requirements for parents and certain disabled adults, outcomes for these populations will be watched nationally as test of extending work requirements beyond expansion populations.

## Summary: What Tennessee Is Expected to Do

Tennessee will pursue the most aggressive work requirement approach of any state, seeking block grant authority to implement requirements for traditional Medicaid populations that federal law doesn't mandate. The state's pursuit reflects ideological commitment to work-conditioned benefits combined with fiscal incentives under block grant financing.

The paradox is that Tennessee has no Medicaid expansion population. Federal work requirements under OB3 don't apply because the state never accepted expansion. Tennessee's work requirement pursuit is entirely voluntary, extending to populations (parents, certain disabled adults) that other states exempt.

If approved, Tennessee would establish precedents other states could follow. Block grant financing with work requirements could become a model for Medicaid restructuring nationally. If rejected or successfully challenged legally, Tennessee demonstrates the limits of state flexibility in Medicaid design.

Tennessee's approach tests whether work requirements are about promoting employment for expansion adults or represent broader philosophical commitments about conditioning public benefits on work. The answer shapes not just Tennessee's Medicaid program but national policy direction.

## Cross-Program Context

**SNAP and TANF Coordination**

Tennessee operates SNAP ABAWD requirements and TANF work requirements through the Department of Human Services. If TennCare III implements work requirements, coordination across programs would reduce duplication but also compound consequences for families subject to multiple requirements.

**No Expansion Population**

The fundamental cross-program context is that Tennessee has no Medicaid expansion population. The state's work requirement pursuit applies to traditional Medicaid categories, not the population federal law targets.

**Marketplace Dynamics**

Tennessee operates on the federally facilitated marketplace. Coverage gap adults who would gain Medicaid under expansion instead have no affordable coverage option. If Tennessee expanded and then implemented work requirements, marketplace transitions would become relevant for those losing Medicaid eligibility.

**Hospital Financial Pressure**

Tennessee hospitals face significant uncompensated care costs from the uninsured coverage gap population. Hospital systems have supported expansion as financial stabilization. Work requirements that reduce enrollment (if Tennessee ever expands) would increase uncompensated care rather than decrease it.

**Provider Tax Structure**

Tennessee relies on hospital assessments for Medicaid financing. The TennCare III block grant proposal includes provider tax provisions. How work requirements interact with provider financing depends on block grant terms.
