## Work Requirement History

Michigan's Healthy Michigan Plan implemented work requirements in January 2020, making it one of the last states to do so before litigation and the pandemic halted all programs nationally. The two months of implementation provided limited outcome data but significant design lessons.

**Healthy Michigan Plan Background**

Governor Rick Snyder (R) expanded Medicaid in 2013 through the Healthy Michigan Plan, making Michigan an early Republican-led expansion state. The expansion included "personal responsibility" provisions requiring enrollees to complete health risk assessments and contribute to Healthy Michigan Health Accounts based on income.

The 2018 legislation authorizing work requirements (Public Act 208) passed with bipartisan support, though Democratic votes were not necessary given Republican legislative control. The law required able-bodied adults ages 19-62 to demonstrate 80 hours monthly of qualifying activities including employment, education, job training, or community service.

**Human-Centered Design Investment**

Michigan distinguished itself through substantial investment in human-centered design for member communications and reporting systems. The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services worked with navigator organizations, healthcare systems, and community groups throughout the development process.

Key design elements included:

*Plain Language Communications:* All member notices were tested with actual Medicaid enrollees before implementation. Complex policy concepts were translated into accessible language. Visual design emphasized clarity over comprehensiveness.

*Multiple Reporting Channels:* Members could report compliance through online portal, telephone hotline, mail, or in-person at MDHHS offices. The system was designed to reduce barriers created by digital-only reporting that had caused catastrophic failures in Arkansas.

*Navigator Feedback Integration:* Community organizations providing enrollment assistance participated in system design reviews, identifying potential barriers before they affected members.

*Deemed Compliance from Other Programs:* Perhaps most significantly, Michigan established automatic deemed compliance for individuals meeting work requirements through SNAP or TANF. Rather than requiring separate documentation for Medicaid, the state systems communicated to recognize existing compliance.

**Implementation Timeline and Halt**

Work requirements took effect January 1, 2020, for adults enrolled in Healthy Michigan Plan for at least 12 months. The rollout was phased:

- January 2020: Requirements effective; reporting systems activated
- February 2020: First full reporting month completed
- March 2020: Court of Appeals ruling in Gresham v. Azar cast doubt on CMS authority to approve work requirements
- March 2020: COVID-19 pandemic triggered federal maintenance of effort requirements, suspending all disenrollments

The program operated for approximately 60 days before external factors halted it. During this period, no enrollees lost coverage for noncompliance, as the initial months focused on enrollment in reporting systems rather than enforcement.

**Lessons from Brief Implementation**

Despite the abbreviated timeline, Michigan's implementation generated important findings:

*Communication Design Matters but Cannot Overcome Complexity:* Even well-designed communications could not eliminate confusion about a fundamentally complex policy. Navigators reported that members understood individual concepts but struggled with the overall system.

*Training Gaps Emerged Quickly:* The compressed timeline between policy finalization and implementation created situations where MDHHS workers and navigators encountered questions they could not answer. System knowledge was unevenly distributed.

*Deemed Compliance Worked as Designed:* The automatic recognition of SNAP and TANF compliance successfully reduced verification burden for enrollees already meeting requirements through other programs. This feature demonstrated that cross-program coordination can simplify implementation.

*Reporting System Uptake Was Gradual:* Initial reporting rates suggested many enrollees had not yet engaged with the new system. Whether rates would have increased with time or enforcement, or whether significant populations would have remained unreported, cannot be determined from the brief implementation window.

## Current Policy and Waiver Status

**Political Landscape Shift**

Michigan's political environment has shifted significantly since 2018. Governor Gretchen Whitmer (D) took office in January 2019 and has expressed skepticism about work requirements. The 2022 elections gave Democrats full control of state government (governor, Senate, House) for the first time since the 1980s.

The Biden administration's rescission of work requirement waivers meant Michigan's approved waiver expired without the state seeking renewal. Under current law, the 2018 work requirement statute remains on the books but is not being implemented.

**Federal Mandate Changes Calculus**

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act's inclusion of mandatory work requirements for expansion adults changes Michigan's options. Rather than choosing whether to pursue work requirements, the state must now determine how to implement federally mandated requirements in ways consistent with its policy preferences.

The Whitmer administration has not publicly detailed its implementation approach. Key questions include:

- Will Michigan seek waivers for maximum exemptions permitted under federal law?
- Will the state revive its deemed compliance provisions from the 2020 attempt?
- What role will MCOs play in verification and navigation?
- How will the state handle Upper Peninsula populations with limited service access?

**Managed Care Infrastructure**

Michigan operates Healthy Michigan Plan through a robust managed care system. Ten Medicaid Health Plans serve expansion adults across the state. These MCOs have existing member engagement infrastructure, care coordination capacity, and data systems that could support work requirement implementation.

During the 2019-2020 planning process, MCOs engaged actively in system design. Several developed navigator partnerships and member communication strategies. This infrastructure remains available, though MCO staff have turned over and institutional knowledge has dissipated since implementation was halted.

## Defining Characteristics

**Scale and Diversity**

Michigan's approximately 700,000 expansion enrollees make it one of the largest populations subject to work requirements nationally. Only Ohio, Pennsylvania, and a few other states have comparable scale. Implementation outcomes in Michigan will significantly affect national assessment of whether work requirements can function at scale.

The population's diversity creates implementation complexity:

*Geographic Diversity:* Metro Detroit has dense healthcare infrastructure, robust public transit, and numerous navigator organizations. Upper Peninsula communities may be hours from the nearest MDHHS office, lack broadband internet access, and have limited employment options. A single policy must accommodate both contexts.

*Racial and Ethnic Diversity:* Michigan's expansion population includes significant Black populations (concentrated in Detroit, Flint, Benton Harbor), Arab-American populations (Dearborn, Hamtramck), Hispanic populations (Southwest Detroit, western Michigan agricultural areas), Native American populations (Upper Peninsula, northern Lower), and refugee communities from multiple continents. Language access, cultural competency, and targeted outreach must address this diversity.

*Economic Diversity:* Some expansion enrollees lost stable manufacturing jobs and cycle between coverage as they transition between employment. Others face chronic barriers to employment. Automotive industry disruption means middle-aged workers with decades of employment history may now qualify for Medicaid.

**Human-Centered Design Legacy**

Michigan's investment in human-centered design during 2019-2020 created institutional capacity and documentation that remains available. The state has templates for plain-language communications, navigator training materials, and system design specifications developed through member testing.

Whether this legacy translates to 2026 implementation depends on staff continuity, system compatibility, and political will to invest in supportive implementation. The raw materials exist; whether they will be used remains uncertain.

**SNAP/TANF Deemed Compliance**

Michigan's automatic deemed compliance provision represents a model other states could adopt. By recognizing work requirement compliance demonstrated through SNAP or TANF, the state reduced verification burden for enrollees already documenting work through other programs.

The federal mandate complicates this approach. Whether CMS will permit states to deem compliance across programs, or will require independent Medicaid verification even for individuals already reporting work for SNAP, remains to be determined through regulation. Michigan's prior design provides a template if cross-program deemed compliance is permitted.

**Tribal Population Considerations**

Michigan's twelve federally recognized tribes present both challenges and opportunities. Tribal members eligible for Indian Health Service automatically qualify for exemption under federal work requirements. However, IHS service area designation and enrollment verification require tribal-state coordination.

Several Michigan tribes operate their own health systems and social service programs. The coordination mechanisms for recognizing tribal employment, education, or community service as qualifying activities require development. Upper Peninsula tribes face particular geographic challenges, as members may live on reservation lands far from state verification infrastructure.

**MCO Capacity**

Michigan's Medicaid Health Plans provide implementation capacity unavailable in states without robust managed care. MCOs have:

- Existing member contact information and communication systems
- Care coordination staff who could incorporate work requirement support
- Data systems capable of tracking and reporting compliance
- Financial incentive to maintain enrollment (capitation payments continue only if members remain enrolled)

Whether the state activates MCO capacity for work requirement implementation, and how MCOs respond, will significantly affect outcomes. MCOs could serve as navigation infrastructure or could remain passive while members navigate requirements independently.

## Expected Policy Posture and Timeline

**Expected Approach: Zero-Friction Within Federal Constraints**

The Whitmer administration is expected to implement work requirements with maximum exemptions and minimum barriers permitted under federal law. This reflects both the governor's policy preferences and pragmatic recognition that coverage losses harm the state's healthcare system.

Anticipated features:

*Maximum Exemptions:* Michigan will likely claim every exemption category permitted under federal regulations, including medical frailty, pregnancy, caretaking, student status, and substance use disorder treatment.

*Automated Verification:* The state will likely maximize use of data matching and deemed compliance to verify work without requiring member action. If federal regulations permit SNAP/TANF deemed compliance, Michigan will almost certainly adopt it.

*MCO Engagement:* Medicaid Health Plans will likely receive responsibility for member outreach and possibly navigation support. MCOs have incentive to prevent coverage losses and capacity to engage members.

*Multiple Reporting Channels:* Based on the 2020 design, Michigan will provide online, telephone, mail, and in-person reporting options. Digital-only requirements are unlikely given rural population characteristics.

**Political Complications**

The 2024 elections returned the Michigan House to Republican control while Whitmer remains governor through January 2027. This divided government creates uncertainty:

- Legislature could mandate stricter implementation than the administration prefers
- Budget negotiations could affect navigation infrastructure funding
- Policy differences could delay implementation planning

The federal December 2026 deadline provides leverage for the administration; delayed implementation is not an option regardless of legislative preferences.

**Timeline**

- 2025: Federal regulatory guidance development; state planning begins
- Early 2026: System development; staff training; navigator partnerships
- Mid-2026: Member communications; reporting system activation
- December 2026: Federal work requirement effective date
- January 2027: New governor takes office; continuation uncertain depending on 2026 election

## Summary: What Michigan Is Expected to Do

Michigan will implement federal work requirements by December 2026 with emphasis on automatic verification, maximum exemptions, and supportive infrastructure. The state's human-centered design legacy provides templates and institutional knowledge. Managed care infrastructure offers implementation capacity. Cross-program deemed compliance, if federally permitted, will reduce verification burden for SNAP and TANF participants.

The scale of Michigan's expansion population means implementation outcomes will significantly affect national assessment. If Michigan achieves high compliance rates with minimal coverage losses, it demonstrates that work requirements can function without Arkansas-style catastrophe. If Michigan experiences significant coverage losses despite supportive implementation, it raises questions about whether any approach can prevent harm at scale.

Geographic diversity creates particular challenges. Upper Peninsula populations face barriers that metro Detroit populations do not. Statewide policy must accommodate both contexts, likely requiring targeted approaches for isolated communities.

Michigan's divided political environment creates uncertainty about implementation approach and sustainability. The Whitmer administration will control initial implementation, but the 2026 gubernatorial election could bring a Republican administration with different priorities. Implementation designed to minimize coverage loss could be redesigned to emphasize enforcement after January 2027.

The Arab-American population in southeast Michigan presents unique language access requirements. Arabic-language communications, culturally competent navigators, and awareness of community networks will be necessary for effective outreach in Dearborn and surrounding areas.

Refugee populations across the state face compounded barriers: language access, unfamiliarity with American bureaucratic systems, potential documentation challenges, and cultural factors affecting engagement with government programs. Whether Michigan's human-centered design can accommodate these populations remains to be demonstrated.

Michigan's automotive industry transition means the expansion population includes displaced manufacturing workers cycling between coverage during job transitions. Work requirements may affect people who work most of the year but fall short during transition periods. The 80-hour monthly threshold creates cliff effects for workers with variable hours.

## Cross-Program Context

**SNAP Employment & Training**

Michigan operates SNAP E&T programs through Michigan Works! agencies across the state. The infrastructure for workforce development services exists, though capacity varies by region. SNAP ABAWD requirements affect a similar population to Medicaid work requirements.

During the 2020 implementation, automatic deemed compliance for SNAP work requirement participants significantly reduced Medicaid verification burden. If federal regulations permit continuation of this approach, the same coordination would apply in 2026.

**TANF Work Requirements**

Michigan's Family Independence Program (TANF) includes work requirements administered through the same MDHHS system that handles Medicaid. Deemed compliance for TANF participants reduces duplication for families receiving both TANF and Medicaid.

**Housing Assistance**

Detroit Housing Commission and other public housing authorities operate in areas with concentrated Medicaid expansion populations. Housing stability affects employment stability; coordination between housing services and Medicaid could support compliance for populations facing housing insecurity.

**Provider Tax Structure**

Michigan utilizes provider taxes (hospital assessment, nursing facility quality assurance assessment) for Medicaid financing. Provider systems have financial interest in maintaining coverage; rural hospitals particularly vulnerable to coverage losses from work requirements.

**Marketplace Infrastructure**

Michigan operates a state-based marketplace (MI Health Link) providing robust infrastructure for coverage transitions. Expansion adults losing Medicaid coverage for work requirement noncompliance may qualify for marketplace coverage with subsidies depending on income. The transition pathway is clearer than in federally facilitated marketplace states.

**Tribal Programs**

Twelve federally recognized tribes operate their own social service programs with varying levels of integration with state systems. Inter-Tribal Council of Michigan provides coordination infrastructure but does not administer services directly. Tribal-state coordination mechanisms for work requirement exemptions require development.
