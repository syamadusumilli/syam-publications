## The Federal Territory Faces Compounding Federal Threats

**Series 14: State Implementation of Work Requirements**

**Word Count Target:** 2,500 words

## District Profile

**Demographics**

- Expansion adult population: approximately 118,000 (May 2025)
- Total Medicaid enrollment: approximately 257,000-305,000 (representing 38-45% of DC population)
- DC population: approximately 672,000
- Age distribution: 28% of enrollees are children
- 11% of enrollees have three or more chronic conditions
- Racial composition: approximately 95% of non-elderly Medicaid participants are people of color
- Three out of four children enrolled in Medicaid and DC Healthy Families are Black
- 64% of Medicaid adults are working (47% full-time, 17% part-time)
- Medicaid covers 38% of the District's single congressional district population

**Geographic Characteristics**

- Entirely urban jurisdiction: 68 square miles with no rural territory
- Eight wards with substantial variation in income, health status, and Medicaid enrollment
- Ward 7 and Ward 8 (east of the Anacostia River): highest poverty, highest Medicaid enrollment, predominantly Black population
- Ward 3: lowest Medicaid enrollment, highest income
- Single concentrated administrative geography simplifies implementation compared to states
- No county or local agency variation; centralized administration through Department of Health Care Finance
- Metro system and bus networks provide transportation infrastructure, though service gaps exist in high-poverty wards

**Special Population Concentrations**

- Federal workforce: over 180,000 federal jobs in DC; 2025 DOGE layoffs significantly impacted employment and may affect Medicaid eligibility for newly unemployed workers
- Immigrant population: DC Healthcare Alliance covers approximately 26,000 individuals regardless of immigration status; OB3 restricts Medicaid eligibility for certain immigrant categories beginning October 2026
- Homeless population: approximately 4,000-5,000 individuals experiencing homelessness; concentrated in downtown and eastern wards

- Major industries: federal government, professional services, hospitality, education, healthcare
- Minimum wage: $17.50 per hour (2025), significantly above federal floor
- Dual labor market: high-wage professional sector alongside low-wage service economy
- Federal workforce disruption creates economic uncertainty affecting Medicaid enrollment dynamics

## Work Requirement History

DC has no prior work requirement implementation experience. The District expanded Medicaid early, using a Section 1115 waiver to cover childless adults before the ACA, and has consistently maintained more generous eligibility than federal minimums require.

Current eligibility extends to 215% of the federal poverty level for childless adults and parent/caretaker relatives, well above the standard 138% FPL expansion threshold. This generous eligibility reflects the District's progressive political orientation and commitment to universal coverage principles.

However, DC's Medicaid program is changing independent of work requirements. Effective January 1, 2026, eligibility for parent/caretaker relatives and childless adults decreases from 215% FPL to 133-138% FPL, aligning with standard expansion parameters. This change, announced by DHCF in 2024, will reduce the expansion population before work requirements take effect.

The DC Healthcare Alliance, a locally funded program covering individuals regardless of immigration status, faces separate restrictions under OB3 that will reduce eligibility for certain immigrant categories beginning October 2025.

## Current Policy and Waiver Status

**No Work Requirement Waiver**

DC has not submitted a Section 1115 waiver for work requirements and shows no indication of seeking early implementation. The District's political leadership, from Mayor Muriel Bowser to the DC Council, opposes Medicaid restrictions generally and work requirements specifically.

The District operates under a standard Medicaid state plan with Section 1115 waiver authority for specific programs including the DC Healthcare Alliance and SUD treatment services. None of these waivers include or contemplate community engagement requirements.

**OB3 Federal Mandate and FMAP Threat**

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act requires DC to implement work requirements for expansion adults by January 1, 2027. However, OB3 also threatens DC with a separate, more severe fiscal crisis: reduction of the District's Federal Medical Assistance Percentage from 70% to 50%.

The 70% FMAP was established in 1997 under the National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act, recognizing DC's unique inability to tax the income of the more than 60% of workers who commute into the District from Maryland and Virginia. Unlike states, DC cannot levy income taxes on non-residents who work within its borders, creating a structural revenue limitation that justified the enhanced federal match.

Congressional Republicans have proposed reducing DC's FMAP to align with the standard 50% floor, characterizing the enhanced rate as an unfair subsidy. The Congressional Budget Office estimates this change would save the federal government approximately $800 million annually, but would require DC to either increase local spending by 63% or dramatically reduce Medicaid eligibility, benefits, or provider payments.

Mayor Bowser warned that reducing the FMAP would create a "$2.1 billion loss in funding for hospitals, universities, and community providers" and could force at least one major medical system to close entirely.

**Political Environment**

DC operates under unique governance constraints. While the District has elected local government, Congress retains ultimate authority over DC affairs and can override local legislation or impose requirements on the District.

The current political environment is hostile to DC autonomy. The Trump administration has issued executive orders targeting District policies, and House Republicans have proposed multiple measures restricting DC self-governance. The FMAP reduction proposal represents one dimension of this broader federal intervention.

DC's non-voting Delegate, Eleanor Holmes Norton, actively opposes Medicaid cuts and FMAP reduction but lacks voting power in Congress. The District's fate depends on decisions made by legislators representing other jurisdictions.

## Defining Characteristics

**Urban Concentration and Administrative Simplicity**

DC's entirely urban geography and centralized administration create implementation advantages unavailable to states. The Department of Health Care Finance directly administers Medicaid without county or local agency intermediaries. This structure allows consistent policy application, centralized training, and unified systems development.

With only 118,000 expansion adults, the affected population is among the smallest of any jurisdiction. Implementation can potentially be more personalized and navigation-intensive than states serving millions.

However, the small scale also means limited administrative capacity. DHCF serves a small jurisdiction without the economies of scale available to larger state Medicaid agencies.

**Managed Care Infrastructure**

DC operates Medicaid managed care through three MCOs: AmeriHealth Caritas DC, MedStar Family Choice DC, and Amerigroup DC. Effective April 2023, CareFirst exited the market and enrollees transitioned to Amerigroup. As of October 2023, behavioral health services including mental health and substance use disorder treatment were carved into managed care, expanding MCO responsibilities.

MCOs have existing member communication channels and care coordination capacity. The consolidated market (three plans serving 257,000 total enrollees) allows closer DHCF oversight than states with numerous MCOs serving millions.

**Extreme Income Inequality**

DC's defining demographic characteristic is extreme income inequality. The District has the nation's highest per-capita income ($95,000+) but also neighborhoods with poverty rates exceeding 30%. Ward 8, east of the Anacostia River, has poverty rates triple the District average.

This inequality concentrates Medicaid enrollment in specific geographic areas. Work requirement implementation will disproportionately affect Wards 7 and 8, where employment opportunities are more limited, transportation access is weaker, and residents face multiple barriers to formal labor market participation.

The District's $17.50 minimum wage means that workers meeting the 80-hour monthly requirement at minimum wage earn approximately $1,400/month gross, well above the poverty line. Unlike states with $7.25 minimum wages where work requirement compliance can still leave workers in poverty, DC's minimum wage creates clearer pathways from work to Medicaid exit through income exceeding 138% FPL.

**Federal Workforce Dependency**

DC's economy depends heavily on federal employment, both directly (federal agencies headquartered in the District) and indirectly (contractors, support services, hospitality serving federal workers and visitors). The 2025 DOGE-initiated workforce reductions and the November 2025 government shutdown significantly disrupted DC's economy.

Some terminated federal workers may qualify for Medicaid during unemployment, creating enrollment increases at the same time work requirements are being implemented. Others may leave the District entirely, affecting both Medicaid enrollment and local tax revenue.

The government shutdown ongoing as of late 2025 compounds economic uncertainty. DC-specific effects are more severe than in states where federal employment represents a smaller share of the economy.

## Expected Policy Posture and Timeline

**Anticipated Approach: Reluctant Minimal Compliance**

DC will implement federal work requirements only because non-compliance would forfeit the 90% federal match for expansion adults. The District's leadership opposes work requirements ideologically and has no incentive to demonstrate policy effectiveness.

Expected implementation characteristics:

The District will likely interpret exemption categories as broadly as federal rules permit, maximizing the population exempt from work requirements through disability, caregiving, education, and other pathways.

DC's strong social services infrastructure, including navigation capacity and community organization partnerships, can support compliance assistance more effectively than states with limited administrative capacity.

The concentrated geographic distribution of the affected population enables targeted outreach. Rather than attempting to reach expansion adults scattered across rural counties, DC can focus resources in Wards 7 and 8.

**Compounding Fiscal Threats**

Work requirements represent only one of multiple Medicaid threats DC faces. The potential FMAP reduction from 70% to 50% would be far more devastating than work requirement coverage losses. If the FMAP is reduced, DC may face choices about whether to maintain Medicaid expansion at all.

The Urban Institute estimates that if the 50% FMAP floor is removed, the enhanced expansion match is eliminated, and DC's FMAP is reduced to 50%, the District would need to increase state Medicaid spending by 83% to maintain current programs. This is financially impossible.

Work requirement implementation occurs against this backdrop of fiscal uncertainty. If the FMAP is reduced, work requirements become secondary to fundamental program survival.

**Timeline Uncertainty**

January 1, 2027 is the statutory deadline, but DC faces the same CMS guidance delays as states. The District must build verification systems, develop exemption processes, and communicate with 118,000 expansion adults in approximately 14 months from OB3 passage.

The concentrated population and centralized administration may enable faster implementation than large states with distributed systems. However, DHCF bandwidth is limited, and the agency simultaneously manages MCO contract oversight, behavioral health integration, Alliance program changes, and eligibility threshold reductions.

## Summary: What DC Is Expected to Do

DC will implement federal work requirements because non-compliance would forfeit the enhanced expansion match, but implementation will emphasize exemption breadth and navigation support rather than enforcement.

The District's small expansion population (118,000), concentrated geography, and centralized administration create implementation advantages. Single-agency administration without county variation enables consistent policy application. Three MCOs with established member relationships can support compliance assistance.

However, work requirements are not DC's primary Medicaid concern. The potential FMAP reduction from 70% to 50% threatens program viability in ways work requirements cannot match. If Congress reduces DC's FMAP, the District may face fundamental choices about Medicaid program scope that make work requirement implementation secondary.

The affected population is concentrated in Wards 7 and 8, east of the Anacostia River, where poverty is highest and employment opportunities most limited. Whether work requirements create coverage losses concentrated in already-disadvantaged neighborhoods depends on exemption breadth and navigation intensity.

DC offers a test case for work requirement implementation in a jurisdiction with strong safety net infrastructure, generous prior eligibility, and ideological opposition to the underlying policy. If reluctant implementers can maintain coverage through aggressive exemption and navigation strategies, DC provides a model. If administrative friction creates coverage losses despite favorable conditions, it suggests work requirements inherently produce coverage reductions regardless of implementation philosophy.

## Cross-Program Context

**DC Healthcare Alliance**

The Alliance provides healthcare coverage to approximately 26,000 District residents regardless of immigration status. OB3 restricts Medicaid eligibility for certain humanitarian categories beginning October 2026. Individuals losing Medicaid due to immigration status changes may transition to Alliance, but Alliance is locally funded without federal match and faces its own fiscal constraints.

**SNAP Coordination**

DC administers SNAP through the Department of Human Services, separate from DHCF's Medicaid administration. SNAP ABAWD work requirements apply to a subset of the population. Cross-program verification could reduce duplicative burden, but requires inter-agency coordination that does not currently exist.

**FMAP Vulnerability**

The 70% FMAP established in 1997 recognizes DC's structural inability to tax commuter income. If reduced to 50%, DC would lose approximately $800 million annually in federal Medicaid funding. The Urban Institute estimates maintaining current programs would require increasing local Medicaid spending by 63-83%, depending on whether expansion match changes are included.

This FMAP threat overshadows work requirements as DC's primary Medicaid concern.

**Marketplace Fallback**

DC Health Link operates the District's state-based marketplace. Expansion adults losing Medicaid may qualify for marketplace coverage with premium tax credits, though December 2025 subsidy expiration creates affordability uncertainty.

DC's marketplace is well-functioning with strong enrollment assistance infrastructure. However, OB3 provisions may make individuals losing Medicaid due to work requirement non-compliance ineligible for premium tax credits, eliminating the marketplace safety net for this population.
