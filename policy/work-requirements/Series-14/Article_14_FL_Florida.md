## Work Requirement History

Florida has no history of implementing Medicaid work requirements because Florida has not expanded Medicaid. The state has neither sought nor received federal waivers for work requirement programs. This places Florida in a fundamentally different position from states like Georgia, Arkansas, or Michigan: when federal work requirements take effect in December 2026, Florida will have no expansion population to which they apply.

This does not mean Florida Medicaid has avoided work-related policies entirely. Florida has historically maintained some of the strictest Medicaid eligibility limits in the nation. Parents with dependent children qualify for Medicaid only with incomes below approximately 26% of the federal poverty level, roughly $4,700 annually for a family of three. Adults without dependent children remain categorically ineligible regardless of income. These restrictions reflect policy choices that have the practical effect of limiting coverage to people who are either working (and thus generally not impoverished enough to qualify) or unable to work due to age, disability, or pregnancy.

Governor Ron DeSantis has consistently opposed Medicaid expansion throughout his administration, characterizing it as federal overreach and fiscal imprudence. State Senate President Kathleen Passidomo called expansion "a false government promise" at the start of the 2025 legislative session. The Republican-controlled legislature has not advanced expansion legislation despite multiple attempts by Democratic lawmakers.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act's work requirements thus represent an interesting policy moment for Florida. The state avoided the costs of building verification systems by never expanding. But the law's other Medicaid provisions, including reduced federal matching rates for expansion states and changes to eligibility verification requirements, may affect Florida's existing Medicaid program and its coverage gap population in ways that are only beginning to become clear.

## Current Policy and Waiver Status

**Non-Expansion Status**

Florida remains one of ten states that have not expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. The state does not receive the 90% enhanced federal matching rate available to expansion states, instead operating with a traditional matching rate of approximately 60% for most populations.

The state's refusal to expand created the coverage gap: approximately 388,000 Floridians with incomes below 100% FPL who earn too much for traditional Medicaid but too little to qualify for ACA Marketplace subsidies. This population includes childless adults and parents whose incomes exceed Florida's poverty-level eligibility limits but fall below the poverty line. Without expansion, these individuals have no pathway to affordable coverage.

**Ballot Initiative Efforts**

Florida Decides Healthcare launched a citizen-led ballot initiative in early 2024 to place Medicaid expansion before voters in November 2026. The campaign collected over 200,000 signatures and raised $6 million before suspending operations in September 2025.

The suspension resulted from HB 1205, legislation signed by Governor DeSantis in May 2025 that dramatically increased costs and restrictions on ballot initiatives. The law raised petition verification fees by more than 3,000% in some counties, shortened submission deadlines from 30 days to 10, required petition gatherers to be Florida residents, and imposed felony penalties for violations. Campaign leadership described the cumulative effect as "a death by a thousand cuts."

Florida Decides Healthcare has shifted its target to the 2028 ballot cycle, planning to restart signature collection in February 2026. The campaign's legal challenge to HB 1205 proceeds in federal court with a trial scheduled for early 2026. Polling has consistently shown approximately two-thirds of Florida voters support Medicaid expansion, including a slim majority of Republicans. Similar ballot measures have succeeded in conservative states including Oklahoma, Missouri, and South Dakota.

**Statewide Medicaid Managed Care**

Florida operates one of the largest and most mature Medicaid managed care programs in the nation. The Statewide Medicaid Managed Care program, fully implemented since 2014, includes three components: Managed Medical Assistance (MMA) for medical services, Long-Term Care (LTC) for elderly and disabled populations, and a dental program.

Approximately 71% of Florida Medicaid enrollees receive care through managed care plans. Ten managed care organizations operate in Florida's MMA program, including Sunshine State Health Plan, Humana, Molina, Aetna Better Health, AmeriHealth Caritas, UnitedHealthcare Community Plan, and others. These plans have varying quality scores, with most receiving 3 to 3.5 stars on a 5-point scale in recent NCQA assessments.

In November 2025, the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration announced intent to award Molina Healthcare the sole contract for the Children's Medical Services (CMS) managed care plan serving approximately 120,000 medically complex children and youth. This contract represents approximately $5 billion in annual premiums.

**KidCare Expansion Complications**

Florida's Republican-controlled legislature passed KidCare expansion in 2023, raising income eligibility for the Children's Health Insurance Program from 210% to 300% of the federal poverty level. The expansion would cover approximately 42,000 additional children.

Implementation has been delayed due to the DeSantis administration's legal challenge to a federal provision requiring 12 months of continuous coverage for enrolled children whose families cannot pay monthly premiums. As of late 2025, the expansion remains in limbo while affected children wait for coverage. This situation illustrates the complex dynamics between state political preferences and federal requirements that would similarly affect any future Medicaid expansion.

## The Dual Eligible Paradox

Florida presents an unusual situation regarding work requirements and vulnerable populations. While the state has no expansion population subject to the December 2026 mandate, it has a substantial dual eligible population that highlights the gaps in Florida's coverage architecture.

**Dual Eligible Population Profile**

Florida has one of the largest dual eligible populations in the nation, with approximately 800,000 to 900,000 individuals receiving both Medicare and Medicaid benefits. These individuals are, by definition, exempt from work requirements: they are elderly (65+) or disabled (qualifying for Medicare through Social Security Disability) and thus fall outside the expansion adult population.

Dual eligible individuals in Florida receive care through several mechanisms. Dual Eligible Special Needs Plans (D-SNPs) coordinate Medicare and Medicaid benefits for approximately 400,000 enrollees. The Statewide Medicaid Managed Care Long-Term Care program serves an additional population requiring nursing home or home and community-based services. The remaining dual eligible population navigates separate Medicare and Medicaid systems with varying degrees of care coordination.

**The Coverage Architecture Problem**

Florida's dual eligible population reveals the paradox of the state's coverage architecture. The individuals with the most expensive and complex healthcare needs, predominantly elderly and disabled populations requiring long-term care, receive comprehensive Medicaid coverage. But working-age adults without dependent children, regardless of how poor they are, receive no Medicaid coverage at all.

This creates perverse incentives. A 60-year-old with diabetes and hypertension who works part-time at a restaurant has no Medicaid eligibility in Florida. The same person, once they turn 65 or become disabled enough to qualify for Social Security, gains access to both Medicare and Medicaid. The state's coverage architecture effectively waits for people to become sick and impoverished enough to qualify for the most expensive forms of care rather than providing coverage that could prevent deterioration.

Work requirements in expansion states are intended to encourage employment among able-bodied adults receiving Medicaid. Florida's approach achieves a superficially similar result through exclusion: able-bodied adults simply do not receive Medicaid, whether working or not. The difference is that exclusion offers no coverage at all, while work requirements at least provide coverage for those who comply.

**Implications for the Coverage Gap**

The 388,000 Floridians in the coverage gap represent a population that would be immediately subject to work requirements if Florida expanded Medicaid. This population is predominantly working-age adults (19-64) without dependent children, exactly the population the One Big Beautiful Bill Act's work requirements target.

Based on national data and Georgia's experience, approximately 60% of coverage gap adults are already working. An additional 20-25% would likely qualify for exemptions due to caregiving responsibilities, health conditions, or other factors. The remaining 15-20% would need to engage with education, training, or community service activities to maintain coverage.

If Florida expanded Medicaid with work requirements, the state would need to build verification and compliance infrastructure from scratch. Unlike Georgia, which has now invested over $100 million in systems that largely failed to function, Florida could potentially learn from other states' experiences. But the DeSantis administration's consistent opposition to expansion makes this scenario unlikely absent a successful ballot initiative or change in political leadership.

## Defining Characteristics

**Administrative Structure**

Florida operates a state-administered Medicaid program through the Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA). Eligibility determinations are handled by the Department of Children and Families (DCF), creating a divided administrative structure that could complicate work requirement implementation if expansion ever occurred.

The state's ACCESS Florida system handles eligibility for multiple programs including Medicaid, SNAP, and TANF. This integrated platform could theoretically enable cross-program verification of work activities, but Florida has not developed the work verification infrastructure that states like Michigan designed for their expansion populations.

**Provider Tax Reliance**

Florida utilizes provider assessments for Medicaid financing, though its reliance on these mechanisms is moderate compared to states like New York or California. Hospital and nursing facility assessments generate significant state matching funds, creating provider interest in maintaining or expanding Medicaid coverage.

The Florida Hospital Association has generally supported maintaining current Medicaid programs but has been cautious about expansion advocacy given the state's political environment. Rural hospitals in Florida face particular financial stress, with reports indicating that 36% of rural hospitals are at risk of closure due to financial losses on patient services.

**Healthcare Workforce Considerations**

Florida faces significant healthcare workforce challenges, particularly in primary care and behavioral health. Access to primary care providers in rural Florida ranks at the 13th percentile nationally, tied with Mississippi as the lowest in the nation. This shortage affects both the current Medicaid population and the uninsured coverage gap population.

The state's 2022 legislation establishing a $15 minimum wage for Medicaid provider employees, with $600 million in funding, represents an attempt to address workforce retention in the Medicaid provider network. Whether similar investments would be available for an expanded Medicaid program remains uncertain.

## What Federal Work Requirements Mean for Florida

Florida occupies an unusual position in the work requirements landscape. The state does not have to implement the December 2026 requirements because it has no expansion population. But federal policy changes embedded in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act affect Florida nonetheless.

**The Enhanced Match Elimination**

The OBBBA's elimination of enhanced federal matching for expansion populations does not directly affect Florida since Florida never received this funding. However, the elimination removes a significant financial incentive for expansion. States that expanded Medicaid received 90% federal matching for expansion adults; now that incentive has shrunk toward traditional matching rates, the financial case for Florida expansion has weakened.

The American Rescue Plan's temporary 5 percentage point increase in traditional Medicaid matching for newly expanding states has also expired, further reducing financial incentives. States that might have been persuaded by generous federal funding now face a less attractive fiscal proposition.

**Reduced Retroactive Coverage**

The OBBBA reduces retroactive Medicaid coverage from 90 days to 60 days beginning January 2027. This change affects all Medicaid beneficiaries, including Florida's existing population. Individuals who delay applying for Medicaid will face increased medical debt exposure. This change particularly affects elderly individuals applying for nursing home Medicaid and people hospitalized before completing their Medicaid applications.

**Semi-Annual Eligibility Verification**

The requirement for semi-annual eligibility redetermination beginning December 2026 will affect Florida's existing Medicaid population, not just expansion adults. Traditional Medicaid populations including elderly, disabled, children, and pregnant women will face more frequent verification requirements.

This change could increase administrative burden on both Florida's eligibility systems and beneficiaries. The state's experience during the COVID-19 public health emergency unwinding, when over one million Floridians lost Medicaid coverage with significant procedural disenrollments, suggests that more frequent redeterminations could produce similar coverage disruptions.

**The Marketplace Fallback**

If ACA enhanced premium subsidies expire without congressional renewal, approximately 4.2 million Floridians who purchased Marketplace coverage in 2024 would face dramatic premium increases. Campaign leadership for Florida Decides Healthcare warned that the uninsured population could nearly triple if subsidies expire, rising from 1.4 million to potentially 3 to 4 million.

This scenario creates an interesting dynamic: federal policy changes intended to reduce Medicaid enrollment through work requirements could simultaneously increase the number of Floridians seeking any available coverage. If subsidies expire and Florida still has not expanded Medicaid, the coverage gap could grow substantially as people priced out of the Marketplace join the existing uninsured population.

## Summary: What Florida Is Expected to Do

Florida will not implement work requirements in December 2026 because Florida has not expanded Medicaid and has no expansion population to which requirements would apply. The state's current trajectory suggests continued resistance to expansion despite polling showing majority support among voters.

**Near-Term Trajectory**

The DeSantis administration will likely continue opposing expansion and defending HB 1205 against legal challenges. If the ballot initiative's lawsuit succeeds, signature collection could resume under less restrictive rules, potentially enabling a 2026 ballot measure. If the lawsuit fails, advocates will continue building toward 2028.

The state will implement OBBBA provisions affecting its existing Medicaid population, including reduced retroactive coverage and more frequent eligibility verification. These changes will stress DCF eligibility systems already challenged by program complexity and workforce constraints.

Florida's MCOs will continue operating the Statewide Medicaid Managed Care program for traditional Medicaid populations. The planned transition of the Children's Medical Services program to Molina represents a significant consolidation of services for medically complex children.

**Contingency Scenarios**

If a ballot initiative succeeds in 2026 or 2028, Florida would need to build work requirement implementation infrastructure essentially from scratch. Unlike states with prior experience or developed systems, Florida would have minimal institutional knowledge of verification systems, exemption processing, or compliance monitoring.

The scale of Florida's potential expansion population, over one million people, would dwarf any prior state implementation. Georgia's Pathways program struggles to enroll even 15,000 people; Michigan briefly implemented requirements for 700,000 enrollees; Florida would potentially need to serve an expansion population larger than either.

Any Florida expansion would likely adopt lessons from other states' failures. Automatic verification using existing data systems (employment records, educational enrollment, program participation) would be essential at scale. Monthly reporting requirements, which Georgia ultimately abandoned, would be impractical for a population of this size. Maximum use of exemptions and deemed compliance would reduce administrative burden.

**The Larger Question**

Florida's situation illustrates a fundamental tension in American health policy. The state with the second-largest coverage gap population, with nearly 400,000 adults unable to afford any health coverage, has actively blocked expansion for over a decade. Work requirements are designed to encourage employment among expansion populations, but Florida's policy achieves a more extreme result: no coverage at all for working-age adults regardless of work status.

The OBBBA's work requirements were designed for states that expanded Medicaid. Florida's refusal to expand means its low-income working adults continue without coverage while states that did expand will implement complex verification systems to ensure their expansion adults are working. The policy irony is stark: Florida's working poor receive less support than expansion states' working poor, yet Florida avoids the administrative burden of proving they are working.

Whether Florida's resistance to expansion will persist depends on political developments, ballot initiative success, and the broader trajectory of federal health policy. If the ACA marketplace subsidies expire and millions more Floridians become uninsured, political calculus could shift. If federal policy further restricts Medicaid through per capita caps or block grants, expansion could become less attractive even with state political change. Florida's path forward remains genuinely uncertain.

## Cross-Program Context

**SNAP Employment & Training**

Florida operates SNAP Employment & Training programs through CareerSource Florida, the state's workforce development system. Approximately 2.8 million Floridians received SNAP benefits before recent changes. The OBBBA's stricter work requirements for SNAP will affect this population beginning in late 2025.

If Florida ever expanded Medicaid, cross-program verification between SNAP and Medicaid would be essential for reducing beneficiary burden. Deemed compliance for individuals meeting SNAP work requirements, as Michigan implemented, could significantly reduce verification demands. However, Florida has not developed these cross-program connections because it has no expansion work requirements to coordinate.

**TANF Work Requirements**

Florida's TANF program already includes work requirements for parents receiving cash assistance. This infrastructure could theoretically support Medicaid work requirement implementation if expansion occurred, but TANF serves a much smaller population than Medicaid expansion would.

**Housing Assistance**

Public housing authorities in Florida's major metropolitan areas, particularly Miami-Dade, Broward, and Orange counties, serve populations that would likely qualify for expanded Medicaid. Housing instability correlates with employment instability, creating verification challenges that would need to be addressed in any expansion implementation.

**Provider Tax Situation**

Florida's hospital and nursing facility assessments would need to be recalculated if expansion occurred, potentially generating additional state matching funds but also creating provider concerns about assessment increases. The state's moderate reliance on provider taxes gives more flexibility than heavily provider-tax-dependent states, but expansion financing would still require careful negotiation with the hospital industry.

**Marketplace Infrastructure**

Florida uses the federally facilitated Marketplace rather than a state-based exchange. If expansion occurred, transitions between Medicaid and Marketplace coverage would need to be managed through Healthcare.gov rather than state systems. This creates coordination challenges but also avoids the cost of building state exchange infrastructure.
