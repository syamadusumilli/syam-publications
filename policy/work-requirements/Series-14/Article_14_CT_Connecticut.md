## Work Requirement History

Connecticut has no prior experience with Medicaid work requirements. The state expanded Medicaid in 2010, making it the first state to adopt the Affordable Care Act's expansion provision, years before the federal exchange launched. This early mover status reflected Connecticut's traditional approach to social programs: expand coverage, minimize barriers, and invest in administrative infrastructure.

The HUSKY D program (for childless adults under 138% FPL) grew from 132,000 enrollees in 2012 to 397,000 by 2024, a 202% increase. This growth occurred without work requirements, time limits, or significant administrative barriers. Connecticut's expansion population now represents approximately 35-40% of total HUSKY enrollment.

Unlike states that sought work requirement waivers during the Trump administration's first term, Connecticut never pursued this path. Governor Ned Lamont's administration viewed work requirements as contrary to the state's coverage expansion goals and administratively burdensome relative to any potential benefits. The state had no existing verification infrastructure, no experience with similar requirements in other programs at the scale contemplated, and a policy preference for maximizing enrollment rather than conditioning benefits.

## Current Policy and Waiver Status

**Federal Mandate Response**

Connecticut faces federal work requirements as an unwilling implementer. Governor Lamont and DSS Commissioner Andrea Barton Reeves have characterized the requirements as federal mandates that the state did not choose and does not support. In July 2025, Lamont noted that "this bill changed 30 times in the last 30 days" and that state agencies were scrambling to understand final requirements.

The state is analyzing implementation approaches but has not announced specific policy choices. DSS indicated that planning was difficult before final bill passage because "without having had those work requirement rules, without having had the final version of the bill, all we could really do is take very educated guesses as to what might happen."

**Implementation Timeline**

Work requirements take effect January 2027 for Medicaid expansion adults. Connecticut may be eligible for a two-year delay (until 2029) if the state demonstrates good faith implementation efforts. Whether Connecticut will pursue this delay and whether federal authorities will grant it remains uncertain.

**Projected Impact**

State analyses project significant coverage losses:

- Comptroller Sean Scanlon's July 2025 report estimated 100,000 to 200,000 Medicaid recipients could lose coverage
- Manatt analysis projects 168,614 Connecticut residents losing Medicaid over ten years
- DataHaven analysis projects approximately 13,000 coverage losses in Hartford alone (11% of city population)
- Similar losses projected in Bridgeport (13,000), Waterbury (11,000), and New Haven (11,000)

The state explicitly warns that most losses will occur among people who are already working or exempt. The Comptroller's report stated: "Many people who are meeting the requirement are projected to lose coverage due to the new compliance paperwork. Many of those not working, for example, due to caregiving responsibilities or a disability, would qualify for an exemption, but even significant numbers of those who should be exempt are expected to be disenrolled due to the new bureaucracy involved with proving it."

## Defining Characteristics

**Administrative Structure: No Managed Care**

Connecticut operates Medicaid through fee-for-service with an Administrative Service Organization (ASO), not through managed care organizations (MCOs). This distinguishes Connecticut from nearly every other expansion state. The state moved away from MCOs in 2012 and has documented significant cost savings, better quality metrics, and higher provider satisfaction compared to MCO-based states.

This structure creates both advantages and challenges for work requirement implementation. Without MCOs, Connecticut lacks the member navigation infrastructure that health plans typically provide. MCOs in other states will bear some responsibility for helping members document compliance; Connecticut will need to build equivalent capacity within DSS or through community partnerships. However, Connecticut's direct relationship with providers and members may enable more efficient verification systems if the state chooses to invest in automated data matching.

A 2024 consultant report commissioned by the Governor's office confirmed the fee-for-service program performs better than comparison states on cost control, quality, and access to care. The state has resisted periodic proposals to return to managed care.

**Provider Landscape**

Two major health systems dominate Connecticut's hospital market:

*Yale New Haven Health* operates five acute care hospitals and numerous outpatient facilities across southern Connecticut. YNHH is the largest provider of Medicaid services in the state and home to two of Connecticut's seven designated safety net hospitals. The system has actively advocated for Medicaid reimbursement rate increases and has warned that federal cuts threaten access to care.

*Hartford HealthCare* operates seven acute care hospitals with nearly 500 healthcare locations statewide. In December 2025, Hartford HealthCare submitted an $86 million bid to acquire Manchester Memorial Hospital and Rockville General Hospital from Prospect Medical Holdings, which would expand its network to nine hospitals.

Both systems have expressed concern about OB3 impacts on hospital finances. At an October 2025 Connecticut Hospital Association convening, Yale New Haven Health President Pamela Sutton-Wallace stated that "the cavalry isn't coming. We are the cavalry," emphasizing the need for collaborative statewide solutions.

Federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) serve concentrated populations in urban cores. The Community Health Center Association of Connecticut has been engaged in work requirement planning discussions, recognizing that their patient populations face significant compliance barriers.

**Provider Tax Vulnerability**

Connecticut relies heavily on provider taxes to fund Medicaid. Yale New Haven Health reports a $200 million annual tax bill for three hospitals, potentially making it among the largest taxpayers in the state. The OB3 phases down the federal "safe harbor limit" for provider taxes from 6% to 3.5% by 2031, with reductions beginning in 2028.

This creates a financing squeeze. Connecticut's current provider tax agreement expires in July 2026, just as work requirement implementation begins. The state had planned to increase hospital taxes by $375 million under a new agreement, but achieving this requires federal waiver approval that OB3 may complicate. The hospital tax provides matching funds that leverage federal dollars; reduced capacity to tax hospitals means reduced federal matching, compounding fiscal pressure.

**Robust State Subsidy Infrastructure**

Connecticut operates Covered Connecticut, a state-funded program providing free coverage to adults earning 138-175% FPL who are ineligible for Medicaid but face affordability barriers in marketplace coverage. This creates a partial safety net for people who lose Medicaid eligibility for work requirement noncompliance if their income falls within the Covered Connecticut range.

However, Covered Connecticut uses marketplace plans rather than Medicaid, meaning coverage differs. People losing HUSKY D would need to transition to a different delivery system even if they remain in subsidized coverage. The administrative burden of this transition may result in coverage gaps.

Access Health CT, the state-based marketplace, provides enrollment infrastructure that federally facilitated marketplace states lack. People transitioning from Medicaid to marketplace coverage have a clear pathway, though the 90% federal matching for expansion populations does not follow them to marketplace coverage.

**Political Environment**

Democrats control Connecticut state government: Governor Lamont, both legislative chambers, and the congressional delegation. The state has no political appetite for aggressive work requirement enforcement. Implementation will likely emphasize maximum exemptions, automated verification to reduce reporting burden, and extended grace periods.

However, the state must comply with federal requirements or risk enhanced federal matching for the expansion population. Connecticut receives approximately 90 cents federal matching for every state dollar spent on HUSKY D; noncompliance with work requirements could jeopardize this funding.

The political environment suggests Connecticut will seek the two-year implementation delay if available, build verification systems designed to maximize deemed compliance, and invest in outreach to ensure exempt populations understand exemption pathways.

**Advocacy Ecosystem**

Connecticut has a robust healthcare advocacy infrastructure:

*CT Health Foundation* produces research and advocates for coverage expansion, including detailed Medicaid fact sheets and work requirement analysis.

*CT Health Policy Project* provides evidence-based policy analysis; Executive Director Ellen Andrews has been a prominent critic of work requirements, arguing they represent "the wrong thing" regardless of implementation approach.

*DataHaven* conducts community data analysis and has produced town-by-town projections of coverage losses under OB3.

*Universal Health Care Foundation of Connecticut* advocates for coverage expansion and has funded research on immigrant coverage options.

This advocacy density ensures policy debates will be well-informed and that implementation failures will be documented and publicized.

## Expected Approach

Connecticut's implementation will reflect its coverage-protective orientation within the constraints of federal requirements.

**Verification Strategy**

The state will likely maximize automated data matching through tax records, SNAP/TANF compliance, and unemployment insurance data. DSS's direct relationship with members (absent MCO intermediaries) may enable more efficient data exchange if systems can be developed in time.

Cross-program deemed compliance for SNAP and TANF participants will reduce verification burden for a significant portion of the expansion population already subject to work requirements in those programs.

**Exemption Emphasis**

Connecticut will likely establish broad exemption pathways and invest in ensuring eligible populations understand and access exemptions. The state's analysis already emphasizes that many people who will lose coverage are exempt but will fail to document exemption status.

**Navigation Investment**

Without MCOs to provide member navigation, Connecticut will need alternative infrastructure. FQHCs, hospital systems, and community organizations may fill this role, but coordination and funding mechanisms remain undefined.

DSS announced hiring 30 additional call center staff in response to anticipated volume increases, but call center capacity addresses inquiry volume rather than proactive outreach.

**Timeline Uncertainty**

Whether Connecticut pursues the two-year delay option and whether it is approved will significantly affect implementation trajectory. A 2029 effective date would provide additional preparation time but would also occur after the 2028 gubernatorial election, potentially changing political dynamics.

## Cross-Program Context

**SNAP Alignment**

Connecticut operates SNAP with existing work requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents (ABAWDs). The OB3 expands SNAP work requirements to age 64 and removes certain exemptions, aligning more closely with Medicaid requirements. Deemed compliance between programs should reduce duplicative verification for people receiving both benefits.

**Provider Tax Impact**

The phasedown of safe harbor limits affects Connecticut's ability to fund Medicaid through provider taxes precisely when work requirements create coverage uncertainty and potential hospital revenue losses from reduced Medicaid enrollment. The timing compounds financial pressure on both the state budget and hospital systems.

**Marketplace Infrastructure**

Access Health CT provides a functional marketplace for coverage transitions. However, enhanced ACA premium tax credits are scheduled to expire, which would increase costs for marketplace coverage precisely when people are transitioning from Medicaid.

**Hospital Financial Stress**

Connecticut hospitals already face financial challenges. A December 2024 Connecticut Hospital Association report documented significant underfunding from Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement. Work requirement coverage losses would increase uncompensated care while the provider tax squeeze reduces matching funds. Rural and independent hospitals face particular vulnerability.

## Summary

Connecticut approaches work requirements as an unwilling implementer with coverage-protective values. The state's first-mover status on Medicaid expansion, absence of managed care infrastructure, and Democratic political control suggest implementation emphasizing automated verification, broad exemptions, and investment in preventing coverage losses among working and exempt populations.

However, Connecticut faces genuine constraints. Building verification systems from scratch requires time and resources the state lacks. The fee-for-service model means no MCO infrastructure exists for member navigation. Provider tax pressures compound fiscal challenges. And federal requirements ultimately constrain state discretion regardless of policy preferences.

The state's urban concentration and relatively small geography may facilitate outreach compared to geographically dispersed states. But concentrated poverty in Hartford, Bridgeport, New Haven, and Waterbury means implementation failures will disproportionately affect communities already experiencing health disparities.

Connecticut will likely emerge as a test case for whether a state committed to coverage protection can implement work requirements without significant coverage losses. The state's administrative capacity, advocacy ecosystem, and political will suggest better outcomes than enforcement-oriented states. But the structural challenges of requiring low-income populations to navigate bureaucratic documentation systems remain regardless of state intent.
