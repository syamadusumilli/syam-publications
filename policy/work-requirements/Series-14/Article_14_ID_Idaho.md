**Word Count Target:** 2,500-3,000 words

## State Profile

**Demographics**

- Idaho Medicaid expansion population: approximately 70,000-90,000 adults ages 19-64
- Represents approximately 4% of state population
- Among smaller expansion populations, similar in scale to South Dakota and Utah
- Age distribution: 19-34 (approximately 45%), 35-49 (approximately 32%), 50-64 (approximately 23%)
- Gender composition: approximately 52% female, 48% male
- Racial and ethnic composition: approximately 83% white, 13% Hispanic/Latino, 1.5% Native American, 2.5% other
- Fastest-growing state in the nation 2020-2024; significant in-migration from California, Washington
- Hispanic/Latino population growing rapidly, concentrated in agricultural regions

**Geographic Characteristics**

- 44 counties with extreme variation in population density
- Boise metro (Ada, Canyon counties): approximately 45% of state population, majority of expansion population
- Idaho Falls, Pocatello, Twin Falls, Coeur d'Alene: secondary concentrations
- Most of state extremely rural; some counties have fewer than 1,000 residents
- Northern Panhandle geographically isolated from southern Idaho
- Significant federal land (approximately 62% of state); limits economic development
- Mountain terrain creates transportation barriers; many communities accessible only by one road
- Nez Perce, Shoshone-Bannock, Coeur d'Alene, and Shoshone-Paiute tribal lands

**Special Population Concentrations**

- Native American population: Nez Perce Reservation, Fort Hall (Shoshone-Bannock), Coeur d'Alene Reservation, Duck Valley (Shoshone-Paiute)
- Large agricultural workforce: dairy, potatoes, cattle, sugar beets, wheat
- Migrant and seasonal farmworkers, predominantly Hispanic/Latino
- Refugee resettlement in Boise (Congolese, Afghan, Ukrainian, Burmese)
- Growing retiree population relocating from higher-cost states
- Moderate substance use disorder prevalence; methamphetamine significant in rural areas
- Limited mental health infrastructure; some counties have no behavioral health providers

**Economic Context**

- State unemployment rate: approximately 2.8-3.2%, among lowest nationally
- Fastest job growth in the nation for several consecutive years
- Major industries: agriculture, technology (growing Boise tech sector), healthcare, manufacturing, tourism
- Agricultural employment seasonal; potato harvest creates significant fall labor demand
- Dairy industry employs large immigrant workforce
- State minimum wage follows federal floor ($7.25), but effective wages higher due to labor market
- Significant in-migration creating housing pressure; rural areas less affected

## Work Requirement History

Idaho's work requirement history parallels Utah's: voters approved expansion through ballot initiative; the legislature immediately moved to add work requirements voters hadn't authorized.

**Proposition 2: The Voter Mandate (2018)**

In November 2018, Idaho voters approved Proposition 2 by 61% to 39%, mandating Medicaid expansion to 138% FPL under the Affordable Care Act. The margin was larger than Utah's similar measure, reflecting broad support across the politically conservative state.

Proposition 2 did not include work requirements. Voters approved straightforward expansion without conditions.

**Senate Bill 1204: The Legislative Override (2019)**

The Idaho Legislature responded to the ballot initiative by passing Senate Bill 1204 in April 2019, adding work requirements that voters had not approved. The bill required the Department of Health and Welfare to seek federal waiver authority for:

*Community Engagement Requirements:* Adults ages 19-59 would document 20 hours weekly (approximately 80 hours monthly) of work, education, job training, job search, or community service.

*Sideboards:* Work requirements would only take effect if they did not jeopardize federal funding and if implementation costs remained within appropriated amounts.

*Exemptions:* Standard exemptions for pregnancy, disability, caregiving, students, and medical frailty.

**The Waiver Application**

Idaho submitted its Section 1115 waiver in July 2019, seeking work requirement authority. The application proposed:
- 20 hours weekly of qualifying activities
- Exemptions for approximately 70% of expansion population
- Self-attestation with documentation available for audit
- Phase-in beginning with new enrollees

**The Stalled Waiver**

Idaho's waiver application was pending when federal court decisions invalidated Arkansas and Kentucky work requirements. CMS continued reviewing the application but did not approve it before the COVID-19 pandemic suspended all work requirement activity.

The Biden administration did not act on Idaho's pending waiver, leaving it in limbo. Unlike some states that formally withdrew applications, Idaho's waiver remained pending but dormant.

**Current Administration Posture**

With the return of a Republican federal administration in 2025 and federal work requirements mandated by OB3, Idaho's waiver situation has changed. The pending waiver is no longer necessary as a vehicle for state-initiated work requirements; federal law now mandates what Idaho previously sought through waiver authority.

## Current Policy and Waiver Status

**Federal Mandate Supersedes State Waiver**

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act's federal work requirement mandate renders Idaho's pending waiver largely moot, similar to South Dakota's situation. The federal requirement establishes the floor; Idaho's question becomes whether to implement exactly to federal specifications or seek modifications.

**Current Planning**

Idaho is proceeding with implementation planning aligned with federal requirements rather than pursuing its original waiver design. Key planning elements:

*Hour Alignment:* Federal 80-hour monthly requirement aligns with Idaho's original 20-hour weekly proposal. No modification needed on hour threshold.

*Verification Design:* Idaho is developing verification systems emphasizing self-attestation with periodic documentation review, consistent with original waiver design.

*Rural Accommodation:* The Department of Health and Welfare is developing approaches for rural counties where employment opportunities are limited and verification infrastructure is minimal.

*Tribal Coordination:* Discussions with tribal governments are ongoing regarding exemptions and potential tribal administration alternatives.

**Legislative Activity**

The Idaho Legislature remains supportive of work requirements. No legislative barriers exist to implementation. The 2024 session appropriated initial funding for system development and administrative preparation.

Governor Brad Little has indicated support for implementation while expressing concern about administrative burden on both the state and expansion population.

## Defining Characteristics

**Extreme Rural Dominance**

Idaho's defining characteristic is extreme rural geography that creates implementation challenges more severe than any other expansion state except Alaska (which has not expanded).

Consider the implementation reality in Custer County:
- Population: approximately 4,300
- County seat (Challis): 1,000 residents
- Nearest hospital: 70+ miles
- No public transportation
- Limited broadband access
- Primary employment: ranching, forest service, recreation
- Workforce development office: none in county

Work requirements in Custer County cannot function the way they function in Boise. There is no employer to verify work hours. There is no workforce development center to facilitate job training. There is no internet cafe where members can submit online documentation. The infrastructure assumptions underlying work requirement design do not exist.

Idaho has 44 counties. At least 30 face some version of this challenge. The Boise metro area where most expansion adults live has adequate infrastructure; the rural areas where a significant minority live do not.

**Agricultural Economy Centrality**

Agriculture shapes Idaho's economy and work requirement implementation:

*Dairy Industry:* Idaho is the third-largest dairy producer nationally. Dairy operations employ large workforces, heavily immigrant, with demanding schedules (dairy cows require attention 365 days per year). Employment is stable but documentation may be informal.

*Potato Industry:* Idaho produces one-third of U.S. potatoes. Employment is highly seasonal: harvest season (September-November) requires massive labor force; winter months have minimal employment. Monthly hour requirements poorly match this pattern.

*Cattle Ranching:* Ranching employment follows seasonal patterns (calving season, haying season) with variable hours throughout the year.

*Migrant Workforce:* Significant migrant and seasonal farmworker population moves through Idaho following crop cycles. This population may qualify for Medicaid when in Idaho but face verification challenges due to mobility and informal employment.

**The Boise-Rural Divide**

Idaho's implementation must serve two distinct states within one:

*Boise Metro:* The Treasure Valley (Ada, Canyon, Gem counties) has diversified economy, growing technology sector, adequate service infrastructure, and most expansion adults. Implementation approaches that work in urban/suburban contexts function here.

*Rural Idaho:* The rest of the state faces limited employment, geographic isolation, minimal infrastructure, and agricultural seasonality. Implementation must accommodate fundamentally different circumstances.

The divide creates policy tension. Designing for Boise produces systems that fail in rural Idaho. Designing for rural Idaho produces systems too permissive for Boise metro implementation. No single approach optimally serves both contexts.

**Limited Administrative Capacity**

Idaho state government has limited administrative capacity compared to larger states. The Department of Health and Welfare serves a state of 2 million with staffing appropriate for that scale. Building work requirement verification systems competes with other priorities.

The state has historically relied on federal programs and contractor support for complex implementations. Work requirement verification may require similar approaches, but contractor capacity in Idaho is limited compared to states with larger markets.

**Ballot Initiative Legacy**

Like Utah, Idaho faces the legitimacy tension of implementing requirements voters didn't authorize. The 61% margin for Proposition 2 was substantial; voters clearly wanted expansion. Whether they wanted expansion with work requirements is unknown because they were never asked.

This tension affects implementation politics less in Idaho than Utah because:
- Idaho's political culture emphasizes legislative authority over direct democracy
- The ballot initiative process is viewed skeptically by the dominant political coalition
- Work requirements align with prevailing political values regardless of voter mandate

Still, advocacy organizations note that voters approved expansion, not conditional expansion, and argue that work requirements contradict voter intent.

## Expected Policy Posture and Timeline

**Anticipated Approach: Pragmatic Rural Accommodation**

Idaho's expected implementation philosophy balances conservative support for work requirements with pragmatic recognition of rural implementation impossibility. The state cannot enforce requirements in counties without employment or verification infrastructure.

Expected elements:

*Self-Attestation Emphasis:* Given limited verification infrastructure, Idaho will likely rely heavily on member self-attestation with periodic documentation review rather than upfront verification.

*Geographic Flexibility:* Rural counties may receive effective exemptions through generous good cause provisions or relaxed verification standards, even without formal geographic exemptions.

*Seasonal Accommodation:* Agricultural employment patterns will require some accommodation, likely through annualized hour calculations or seasonal good cause provisions.

*Tribal Exemptions:* Following Arizona's model, tribal populations will likely receive exemptions given reservation employment realities.

*Minimal Enforcement Infrastructure:* Given limited state administrative capacity, enforcement will likely be minimal. The state may accept higher self-attestation rates rather than build verification infrastructure it cannot afford.

**Timeline**

- 2025: Implementation planning; system development begins
- Late 2025: Verification system design finalization; tribal consultation
- Early 2026: Staff training; member outreach
- Mid-2026: Pilot testing in Boise metro
- December 2026: Full implementation aligned with federal deadline

**Key Uncertainties**

*Rural Viability:* Whether work requirements can function in rural Idaho counties without creating coverage losses among people who cannot access employment or verification infrastructure is the central uncertainty.

*Agricultural Worker Treatment:* How Idaho handles seasonal agricultural employment, particularly for migrant workers with variable Idaho presence, will test system flexibility.

*Verification Infrastructure:* Whether Idaho can build adequate verification systems with limited administrative capacity and state resources is uncertain.

*Tribal Outcomes:* How tribal populations fare depends on negotiation outcomes with tribal governments and whether exemption or tribal administration approaches are adopted.

## Summary: What Idaho Is Expected to Do

Idaho will implement work requirements under federal mandate, building on its 2019 waiver design that was never approved or implemented. The state's approach will likely emphasize self-attestation and minimal verification infrastructure, reflecting both conservative preference for limited government administration and pragmatic recognition of rural implementation impossibility.

The extreme rural geography creates challenges no other expansion state faces at comparable scale. Work requirements designed for metropolitan contexts cannot function in counties with 1,000 residents, no public transportation, no workforce development offices, and agricultural economies with seasonal employment patterns.

Idaho's implementation will test whether work requirements can accommodate extreme rural contexts or whether they inherently assume urban/suburban infrastructure. If Idaho applies uniform requirements regardless of geography, coverage losses will concentrate in rural areas where compliance is structurally impossible. If Idaho effectively exempts rural populations through generous good cause or relaxed verification, work requirements become Boise metro policy only.

The ballot initiative legacy adds political complexity. Voters approved expansion without conditions by a 61% margin. The legislature added requirements voters never considered. Whether this affects implementation politics or member cooperation remains to be seen.

## Cross-Program Context

**SNAP Coordination**

Idaho operates SNAP through the Department of Health and Welfare, the same agency handling Medicaid. SNAP ABAWD requirements affect overlapping populations. Deemed compliance provisions could reduce duplicate verification, and the state's experience with SNAP work requirements provides some administrative foundation.

**TANF Work Requirements**

Idaho's TANF program includes work requirements, providing administrative experience with conditionality enforcement. However, TANF serves a smaller, different population than Medicaid expansion adults.

**Housing Integration**

Idaho does not currently impose work requirements on housing assistance. If federal housing work requirements are added, integration with Medicaid requirements would become relevant for the small population receiving both benefits.

**Tribal Coordination**

Nez Perce, Shoshone-Bannock, Coeur d'Alene, and Shoshone-Paiute tribes require coordination similar to Arizona. Employment conditions on reservations differ from surrounding areas; tribal exemptions or tribal administration alternatives need development.

**Agricultural Workforce Programs**

The state operates various agricultural workforce programs through the Department of Labor. Integration between these programs and Medicaid work requirements could provide employment verification for agricultural workers, though program coverage is incomplete.
