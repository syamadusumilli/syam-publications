## The Non-Expansion Context

Mississippi stands apart from other state profiles in this series because the One Big Beautiful Bill Act's work requirements do not directly affect the state. Federal work requirements apply exclusively to Medicaid expansion adults, those covered under the Affordable Care Act's optional expansion to 138% of the federal poverty level. Mississippi has never expanded Medicaid, leaving 70,000 adults in the coverage gap with no pathway to affordable coverage.

This creates a paradox that defines Mississippi's relationship to federal work requirement policy. The state has resisted Medicaid expansion for a decade, in part because Republican leadership opposes what they characterize as expanding welfare. Yet the federal law now requires work requirements for expansion populations, precisely the condition Mississippi has demanded as a prerequisite for expansion. The state declined expansion when it was voluntary without conditions. Now that work requirements are mandatory for expansion populations nationally, Mississippi still has not expanded.

**Current Eligibility Structure**

Mississippi maintains among the most restrictive Medicaid eligibility thresholds in the nation. Adults with dependent children qualify only if household income does not exceed 24% of the federal poverty level, approximately $488 monthly for a family of three. This is one of the lowest thresholds in the country. There is no pathway for coverage for childless adults regardless of income, so most childless adults below poverty have no options for affordable comprehensive coverage.

Infants under one year qualify with household incomes up to 199% FPL. Children ages one through five qualify at 148% FPL, and children six through eighteen at 138% FPL. The Children's Health Insurance Program covers additional children with household incomes up to 214% FPL. But for adults without dependent children, no income level qualifies them for coverage.

**The Coverage Gap**

The 70,000 adults in Mississippi's coverage gap earn too little to qualify for ACA marketplace subsidies (which begin at 100% FPL) and too much to qualify for Mississippi's restrictive Medicaid (which for most adults requires income below 24% FPL). They exist in a policy no-man's-land created by the Supreme Court's 2012 decision making expansion optional and Mississippi's subsequent choice not to expand.

These coverage gap residents work at the margins of the economy. They hold jobs in restaurants, retail, agriculture, and caregiving that do not offer employer-sponsored insurance. They are precisely the working population that work requirement proponents claim expansion serves, yet Mississippi provides them no coverage pathway at all.

## Failed Expansion Efforts

**2024 Legislative Session**

The 2024 Mississippi legislative session marked the closest the state has come to Medicaid expansion since the ACA's passage. House Speaker Jason White, a Republican, signaled in fall 2023 that the legislature would finally address expansion directly. His statement acknowledged that Republicans had "probably earned a little bit of the bad rap we get on health care in Mississippi. Part of that is that we haven't had a full-blown airing or discussion of Medicaid expansion. We've just said, 'No.'"

House Bill 1725 passed the Mississippi House in February 2024 by a vote of 98-20, a veto-proof supermajority. The bill directed the Division of Medicaid to seek a federal waiver to implement expansion with a 20-hour-per-week work requirement. Critically, the House bill included a fallback provision: if CMS rejected the work requirement waiver, expansion would proceed without the work requirement from January 2025 through early 2029, with a sunset clause requiring reauthorization.

The Senate amended the bill substantially. Rather than accepting the House's 138% FPL threshold with optional work requirements, the Senate version would expand coverage only to 100% FPL and would make expansion entirely contingent on federal approval of the work requirement. The Senate version would not have qualified for the enhanced federal matching rate available to expansion states.

The House and Senate could not reconcile their differences in conference committee. The bill died without becoming law. Lieutenant Governor Delbert Hosemann, who oversees the Senate, expressed disappointment but maintained that he would not support expansion without a work requirement. Senator Kevin Blackwell, chair of the Senate Medicaid Committee, took the same position.

**2025 Legislative Session**

Several Medicaid expansion bills were filed in January 2025, but all died in committee by early February. Additional legislation that would have directed the state to study the feasibility and impacts of expansion and work requirements also failed to advance. Governor Tate Reeves remained opposed, characterizing expansion as "Obamacare" and "welfare" on social media following President Biden's State of the Union address in early 2024.

**The OB3 Complication**

The passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in 2025 fundamentally changed the expansion calculation for Mississippi. The federal law now mandates work requirements for all Medicaid expansion adults beginning December 2026. Had Mississippi expanded in 2024, even with the House's fallback provision that would have implemented expansion without work requirements, the state would now face mandatory federal requirements regardless.

More significantly, OB3 eliminated the enhanced federal incentive that the American Rescue Plan had offered to encourage expansion in holdout states. That provision would have increased the federal matching rate for Mississippi's existing Medicaid population by five percentage points for two years if the state expanded. The incentive has now lapsed. Mississippi, had it expanded in 2024, would have captured hundreds of millions in additional federal funding. That opportunity is gone.

The irony is substantial. Mississippi's Republican leadership demanded work requirements as a condition of expansion. The federal government has now mandated work requirements. Yet the financial incentive to expand has diminished, and the state still has not expanded.

## Healthcare Infrastructure Crisis

Mississippi faces among the most severe rural healthcare crises in the nation. The state's refusal to expand Medicaid compounds financial pressures on hospitals already operating on minimal margins.

**Rural Hospital Vulnerability**

According to the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform, 37 of Mississippi's rural hospitals (55% of the total) are at risk of closure due to financial problems. Of these, 23 face immediate risk of closing within two to three years. Only four states have higher proportions of immediately vulnerable rural hospitals.

The Chartis Group's 2025 analysis found that 49% of Mississippi's rural hospitals are vulnerable to closure, the second-highest percentage nationally behind Arkansas. Mississippi is tied for third nationally in total rural hospitals that have closed or converted to non-inpatient models since 2010, with 11 communities losing inpatient care.

Rural hospitals in non-expansion states operate with lower margins than their counterparts in expansion states. The median operating margin for rural hospitals in expansion states is 3.1%, compared to negative margins in many non-expansion states including Mississippi. When hospitals cannot offset losses from uninsured patients with revenue from expanded coverage, the cumulative financial strain accelerates toward closure.

**Maternity Care Desert**

Mississippi's rural maternity care situation illustrates the broader access crisis. Only 32% of the state's rural hospitals offer labor and delivery services. Most of the 50 rural Mississippi hospitals not delivering babies either never did or stopped long ago, with four closing delivery services within the past fifteen years. At 35 minutes, Mississippi's median travel time to maternity care matches the national average, but this statistic obscures significant variation. Delta residents face far longer travel times.

The Mississippi Hospital Association has supported Medicaid expansion as necessary to address uncompensated care costs straining remaining facilities. Richard Roberson, president and CEO of the Association, has testified that rural hospitals will lose approximately $200 million in 2026 if enhanced ACA marketplace subsidies are not extended. More than half of Mississippi's rural hospitals are already at risk of closing.

## Managed Care Structure

Mississippi operates the MississippiCAN program, a managed care delivery system serving both Medicaid and CHIP populations statewide. As of July 2025, three Coordinated Care Organizations (CCOs) participate:

- **Magnolia Health** (Centene subsidiary): largest CCO by enrollment
- **Molina Healthcare**: national managed care organization
- **TrueCare**: newest CCO, began operations July 1, 2025

UnitedHealthcare Community Plan exited the MississippiCAN and CHIP programs as of June 30, 2025, requiring a special enrollment period for affected members to select new plans.

The CCOs provide care coordination, network management, and care management services for enrolled populations. Provider networks must include all types of Medicaid providers and meet access standards set by the Division of Medicaid. The managed care infrastructure provides a foundation that could support expansion implementation if Mississippi ultimately expands, but that infrastructure currently serves only traditional Medicaid populations.

## The Delta Health Crisis

The Mississippi Delta region represents the most acute concentration of health disparities in the United States. The 18-county region along or near the Mississippi River has average poverty rates of 33%, with some counties exceeding 48%. An estimated 60% of Delta residents live below the poverty level.

African Americans comprise the majority in most Delta counties and face compounding barriers to healthcare access. Research has documented that Black Mississippians are less likely than white peers to have health coverage and more likely to describe poor access to healthcare as contributing to health problems. Approximately 13% of Black Mississippians ages 0 to 64 were uninsured as of 2023.

The Delta has the lowest life expectancy in the United States, the highest overall mortality rates, and the highest mortality rates associated with cancer, heart disease, and stroke. Barriers to health include lack of health insurance, poverty, rurality, shortages of primary care providers, poor infrastructure, and inadequate transportation. These factors compound to create healthcare access challenges that expansion could partially address but non-expansion perpetuates.

Mississippi has the highest cervical cancer death rate nationally, with Black women dying at disproportionately higher rates. Women living in non-expansion states forgo reproductive healthcare at higher rates than women in expansion states due to cost; about 20% of Mississippi women of reproductive age report skipping necessary care because of cost.

## Tribal Healthcare

The Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians operates the Choctaw Health Center, a tribally controlled healthcare facility serving approximately 11,000 tribal members across eight central Mississippi counties. The 180,000 square-foot facility provides comprehensive services including primary care, pharmacy, prenatal care, dentistry, and behavioral health.

Medicaid is an important funding source for the Choctaw Health Center, particularly for services requiring referral outside the tribal system. The Indian Health Care Improvement Act provides states a 100% Federal Medical Assistance Percentage for Medicaid services provided through Indian Health Service and tribal health facilities. The Division of Medicaid maintains regular consultation with the tribe regarding State Plan Amendments and policy changes.

Because federal work requirements apply only to expansion populations, tribal members currently enrolled in Mississippi Medicaid would not be affected by OB3's community engagement requirements. However, if Mississippi ever expanded, tribal members gaining coverage through expansion would face the same requirements as other expansion adults, though tribal-specific exemptions in the federal law may provide protections.

## Summary: What Mississippi Would Face Under Expansion

Mississippi does not face direct implementation requirements under OB3 because the state has not expanded Medicaid. The federal work requirements are irrelevant to Mississippi's current Medicaid population.

If Mississippi were to expand in the future, the state would immediately become subject to mandatory work requirements for expansion adults. The OB3 framework specifies that expansion adults must demonstrate 80 hours monthly of community engagement (employment, education, training, job search, or community service). Mississippi would need to build verification and exemption infrastructure from scratch.

Several observations apply to a hypothetical future expansion:

Mississippi's coverage gap population already works. An estimated 60% of coverage gap residents are employed but lack employer-sponsored coverage. Work requirements would verify what is largely true: this population is working. The compliance burden would fall on people already demonstrating the behavior requirements seek to incentivize.

Administrative infrastructure does not exist. Unlike states with prior work requirement experience or existing systems for similar verification, Mississippi would need to build systems entirely new. The timeline pressure would be significant.

Rural verification would be exceptionally difficult. With 58% of Medicaid enrollees in rural areas and severe transportation barriers in the Delta, in-person verification approaches would be impractical. Digital verification would require addressing the digital divide that leaves many rural Mississippians without reliable internet access.

The hospital system cannot absorb additional coverage losses. Any work requirement design that produces significant coverage losses through procedural failures would accelerate an already critical rural hospital closure crisis.

Community organizations are sparse. The infrastructure of community-based organizations that other states rely on for navigation and enrollment assistance is thin in Mississippi, particularly in the Delta. Building navigation capacity would require substantial investment.

For now, Mississippi remains outside the work requirements framework entirely. The state's 70,000 coverage gap residents have no pathway to coverage, with or without work requirements. The question of whether Mississippi will expand is separate from the question of how it would implement work requirements if it did. The first question remains unanswered after a decade of resistance.
