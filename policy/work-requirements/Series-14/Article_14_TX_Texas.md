## The Non-Expansion Paradox: Why Work Requirements Do Not Apply

**Series 14: State Implementation of Work Requirements**

**Word Count Target:** 2,500-3,000 words

## State Profile

**Geographic Characteristics**

- 254 counties (most of any state), covering 268,596 square miles (second largest state)
- Four major metropolitan regions: Houston, Dallas-Fort Worth, San Antonio, Austin
- 82% of population resides in urban areas, 18% in rural areas
- 157 rural hospitals; 47 facilities classified as vulnerable to closure
- 43% of rural hospitals currently operating at a financial loss

**Special Population Concentrations**

- Despite strong economy, low-wage workers face coverage gap created by lack of Medicaid expansion
- 74% of adults in coverage gap are people of color

## The Fundamental Difference

Texas is fundamentally different from every other state profiled in this series. The federal work requirements established by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act do not apply to Texas because Texas has never expanded Medicaid.

**What the Law Actually Says**

The OBBBA's work requirement provisions apply exclusively to "expansion adults," defined as adults aged 19-64 with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level who gained Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act's optional expansion. Section 1902(xx) of the amended Social Security Act establishes community engagement requirements as a condition of eligibility for this specific population.

Texas never created this population. By declining expansion since 2014, Texas ensured that no Texans gained coverage through the expansion pathway that now carries work requirement conditions. The cruel irony is that the adults who would benefit most from expansion are instead left entirely without coverage, while adults in expansion states at least have coverage, even if it now carries conditions.

**The States That Escaped Work Requirements**

Ten states have never expanded Medicaid: Alabama, Florida, Georgia (partial expansion through Pathways only), Kansas, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Wisconsin (covers adults to 100% FPL through waiver), and Wyoming. Of these, Texas has by far the largest affected population.

For these states, the OBBBA's work requirement provisions are essentially irrelevant. Their low-income adult populations face something worse than work requirements: complete exclusion from coverage regardless of whether they work, volunteer, or engage in any qualifying activity.


## Traditional Medicaid in Texas: Extreme Restrictiveness

Texas maintains one of the most restrictive Medicaid eligibility structures in the nation. Understanding this context is essential for grasping why the work requirement debate has different implications for non-expansion states.

**Who Qualifies for Texas Medicaid**

- Children ages 0-1: household income up to 198% FPL
- Children ages 1-5: household income up to 144% FPL
- Children ages 6-18: household income up to 133% FPL
- Pregnant women: up to 203% FPL (including CHIP Perinatal)
- Parents with dependent children: up to 14-17% FPL (approximately $4,100 annual income for family of three)
- Adults without dependent children: ineligible at any income level
- Elderly and disabled: through SSI or Medically Needy pathways

**The Parent Eligibility Threshold**

The 14-17% FPL income limit for parents is so restrictive that a parent working half-time at minimum wage already earns too much to qualify. A single parent with two children earning more than approximately $340 per month exceeds the threshold. This means most working parents are already ineligible for Medicaid, making work requirements moot for this population.

**Adults Without Children: Total Exclusion**

Adults without dependent children are categorically ineligible for Texas Medicaid regardless of income. A childless adult earning $0 per year cannot qualify. This represents a complete coverage gap that no amount of work, volunteering, or community engagement can overcome.


## The Coverage Gap

The ACA's designers assumed all states would expand Medicaid. Premium tax credits for Marketplace coverage begin at 100% FPL, creating a coverage "donut hole" in non-expansion states where adults earn too much for Medicaid (which barely covers anyone) but too little for subsidized Marketplace coverage.

**Texas Coverage Gap Population**

- Estimated 617,000-726,000 adults currently in coverage gap
- Represents largest coverage gap population of any state
- Accounts for 40-45% of the entire national coverage gap (1.4 million people)
- 74% are people of color
- 60%+ are employed, primarily in low-wage jobs without employer-sponsored coverage
- Median income for coverage gap adults: approximately 56% FPL ($10,000-$12,000 annually for individuals)

**Occupational Profile**

Coverage gap adults work disproportionately in industries that rarely offer affordable health insurance:
- Restaurant and food service workers
- Retail sales and cashiers
- Building cleaning and maintenance
- Agricultural workers
- Home care and personal assistance
- Construction labor

These are precisely the populations who, in expansion states, would now face work requirements. In Texas, they simply have no coverage option despite meeting or exceeding any conceivable work threshold.


## Legislative History: Persistent Rejection

Texas has consistently rejected Medicaid expansion since the ACA's passage, despite repeated legislative efforts by Democrats and occasional interest from some Republicans.

**Expansion Attempts**

- 2013: Legislature declines to consider expansion following ACA implementation
- 2015: Multiple expansion bills introduced; none receive hearings
- 2017: Governor Greg Abbott signals openness to discussing Texas-specific solutions; no legislation advances
- 2019: Multiple bills filed including hybrid approaches; all fail
- 2021: "Live Well Texas" proposal by Rep. Julie Johnson gains some Republican support (nine co-sponsors); fails in committee
- 2023: Multiple bills filed; none advance
- 2025: House votes down expansion 63-85 (largely party-line) during 89th Legislature session; SB 232 introduced by Sen. Nathan Johnson fails to advance

**Political Dynamics**

Governor Greg Abbott and Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick have maintained firm opposition to expansion. Patrick has explicitly criticized ACA Medicaid expansion as harmful, stating in 2022 that Texas was fortunate not to participate because expansion states faced fiscal pressure.

The Texas Public Policy Foundation, a conservative think tank with significant influence in state policy, has advocated for Medicaid reform focused on reducing enrollment and strengthening work-support programs outside the healthcare system rather than expanding coverage.

Polling suggests Texas voters support expansion at approximately 73%, but this public preference has not translated into legislative action given Republican supermajorities and leadership opposition.

## The Block Grant Option Texas Never Pursued

In January 2020, the Trump administration's CMS Administrator Seema Verma announced the "Healthy Adult Opportunity" initiative, inviting states to receive capped federal Medicaid funding (either per capita caps or aggregate block grants) in exchange for greater programmatic flexibility and reduced federal oversight. This represented the most significant federal effort to restructure Medicaid financing since the program's creation in 1965.

**Why Texas Was Not a Candidate**

The block grant option was designed primarily for expansion populations, specifically adults covered under the ACA's optional Medicaid expansion. States could receive fixed federal funding for these populations rather than open-ended matching, accepting fiscal risk in exchange for flexibility to modify benefits, eligibility verification, and program design.

Texas had no expansion population to place under a block grant. The initiative assumed states had already expanded and wanted different financing terms for that population. Non-expansion states like Texas, Alabama, Florida, and Mississippi were essentially irrelevant to the block grant debate because they had no coverage to restructure.

Tennessee was the only state to aggressively pursue a broader block grant encompassing its entire Medicaid program (not just expansion adults), submitting a waiver request in late 2019. That proposal was never finalized before the administration change. Arkansas and Oklahoma expressed interest in block grants as mechanisms for expansion, but neither completed applications.

**The Underlying Policy Tension**

The block grant debate illuminated a fundamental tension in Texas's position. Conservative policy advocates argued that block grants would give states flexibility to design Medicaid programs aligned with local values and fiscal constraints. But Texas already had maximum flexibility in one sense: it had declined expansion entirely, maintaining the most restrictive eligibility in the nation.

Block grants might have been attractive if Texas wanted to expand coverage with capped federal risk. But state leadership preferred no expansion at all over expansion with any federal strings, whether traditional matching or block grant structures.

**The 1115 Transformation Waiver: Texas's Actual Strategy**

Rather than pursue coverage expansion through any mechanism, Texas focused its federal waiver strategy on the 1115 Transformation Waiver, approved in 2011 and extended through 2030. This waiver:

- Expanded Medicaid managed care statewide
- Created Uncompensated Care (UC) pools to support safety-net hospitals serving the uninsured
- Established Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment (DSRIP) programs to improve healthcare quality and efficiency
- Preserved supplemental funding for providers serving high volumes of Medicaid and uninsured patients

The 1115 waiver represents Texas's approach to healthcare access without coverage expansion: direct payments to providers for uncompensated care rather than insurance coverage for individuals. This strategy accepts high uninsurance rates as a policy outcome while attempting to maintain provider infrastructure capable of delivering charity care.

The DSRIP component ended in 2022, and the UC pool continues with periodic resizing. The waiver does not address the coverage gap; it simply helps hospitals survive financially while serving hundreds of thousands of uninsured Texans.


## What the OBBBA Does to Texas

Although work requirements do not apply, other OBBBA provisions significantly impact Texas healthcare infrastructure and populations.

**Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) Cuts**

The OBBBA accelerated DSH payment reductions that had been repeatedly delayed since the ACA's passage. These cuts are particularly significant for Texas, which operates one of the largest uncompensated care pools in the nation precisely because so many residents lack coverage.

Texas hospitals provide approximately $8 billion annually in uncompensated care. DSH payments partially offset these costs. With reductions now in effect (as of October 2025), safety-net hospitals face intensified financial pressure without any corresponding coverage expansion to reduce uncompensated care demand.

**Provider Tax Restrictions**

The OBBBA places new limits on provider taxes, which states use to generate state matching funds for Medicaid. The restrictions are less severe for non-expansion states (caps at 110% of Medicare rates for state-directed payments, versus 100% for expansion states), but still constrain Texas's ability to enhance provider reimbursement.

For non-expansion states, the 6% provider tax cap remains in effect through 2032, with no phase-down required. This creates a modest structural advantage, though it does nothing to address the fundamental coverage gap.

**Rural Hospital Financial Pressure**

The Chartis Center for Rural Health identifies 47 Texas rural hospitals as vulnerable to closure. A third of the state's 157 rural hospitals have fewer than 10 days cash on hand. One-third are operating at a loss.

Federal Medicaid cuts will intensify these pressures through multiple channels: reduced Medicaid reimbursement, accelerated DSH reductions, and inability to access the enhanced federal match available to expansion states. The $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Fund may provide temporary relief, but Texas must compete with other states for these limited funds, and the funding sunsets after five years while structural challenges persist.

**Children and Pregnant Women**

While expansion adults are not subject to work requirements (because they do not exist in Texas), the OBBBA's provisions affecting all Medicaid populations do apply. Six-month eligibility redeterminations (rather than annual) begin December 2026 for all populations where permitted under federal law. This will increase administrative burden and procedural disenrollment risk for Texas children and families.

The reduction in retroactive coverage from 90 days to 60 days (effective January 2027) may increase medical debt for Texans who become ill before applying for coverage.


## The 2026 Deadline Paradox

Expansion states face December 31, 2026, as the deadline to implement work requirement verification systems. Texas faces no such deadline because there is no expansion population to verify.

However, Texas does face the same December 2026 deadline for implementing six-month eligibility redeterminations and other administrative changes. The administrative burden falls on the same state agency infrastructure, creating parallel implementation pressures even without work requirement systems.

**What Texas Must Build**

- Enhanced eligibility verification systems for six-month redeterminations
- Updated notices and communications for affected populations
- Modified managed care organization contracts reflecting new federal requirements
- Systems to implement reduced retroactive coverage periods

**What Texas Does Not Need to Build**

- Work verification infrastructure
- Activity tracking and reporting systems
- Good cause exception processing
- Compliance appeals systems


## Managed Care Landscape

Texas operates one of the largest Medicaid managed care programs in the nation, with approximately 68% of Medicaid spending flowing through MCOs. The four major programs are:

- **STAR:** Children, pregnant women, families
- **STAR+PLUS:** Elderly and disabled populations, including long-term services and supports
- **STAR Kids:** Children with disabilities
- **STAR Health:** Children in foster care

Major MCOs operating in Texas include Centene (Superior HealthPlan), Elevance (Amerigroup), UnitedHealthcare, Molina Healthcare, Community First Health Plans, Texas Children's Health Plan, and others.

Because work requirements do not apply, Texas MCOs do not face the navigation, verification, and retention challenges confronting MCOs in expansion states. Their challenges relate to serving existing populations efficiently rather than managing compliance for expansion adults.


## Tribal Considerations

The three federally recognized tribes in Texas would have been exempt from work requirements had Texas expanded. The exemption for tribal members, enshrined in the OBBBA, applies to "Indians" as defined under federal law who are enrolled in federally recognized tribes.

- **Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas:** Located in Polk County (Big Thicket region), approximately 1,200 enrolled members, half residing on the 10,200-acre reservation
- **Kickapoo Traditional Tribe of Texas:** Located near Eagle Pass in Maverick County, approximately 650 members, maintains connections to Kickapoo communities in Mexico and Oklahoma
- **Ysleta del Sur Pueblo (Tigua):** Located in El Paso, approximately 4,700 enrolled members, one of the oldest Puebloan communities in the Southwest

These tribal members can access care through Indian Health Service facilities and urban Indian organizations like Texas Native Health in Dallas. Medicaid provides supplemental coverage and revenue for tribal health facilities, but the work requirement debate is largely theoretical given Texas's non-expansion status.


## Implications for National Analysis

Texas's exclusion from work requirement provisions raises important questions about the OBBBA's actual policy impact.

**The Hardest-Hit Population Faces No Work Test**

The 617,000-726,000 Texans in the coverage gap represent the population most harmed by America's patchwork coverage system. They work in jobs without health insurance. They earn too little for Marketplace subsidies. They are categorically excluded from Medicaid regardless of their behavior.

Work requirements, whatever their merits or flaws, cannot affect this population because there is no program to require them to participate in. The policy debate about whether conditioning coverage on work promotes self-sufficiency or creates barriers to care is simply irrelevant to Texans who have no coverage to begin with.

**Non-Expansion as the Ultimate Work Requirement Failure**

If the goal of work requirements is to encourage employment while providing healthcare, non-expansion states have achieved the opposite: millions of working adults remain uninsured precisely because their states refuse to cover them.

Texas adults in the coverage gap already work. They meet or exceed any 80-hour monthly threshold. Their problem is not insufficient work effort but insufficient state policy ambition.

**Healthcare Without Coverage Expansion**

Texas has attempted to address healthcare access through mechanisms other than Medicaid expansion: Section 1115 waiver programs for uncompensated care and delivery system reform (DSRIP), charity care networks, community health centers, and emergency department care under EMTALA.

These approaches have not closed the coverage gap. Community health centers provide primary care but cannot offer specialty services, surgery, or chronic disease management at scale. Emergency departments stabilize patients but do not provide ongoing treatment. Charity care is geographically limited and capacity-constrained.


## Looking Forward

Texas will continue operating outside the work requirement framework unless it expands Medicaid. No expansion appears likely in the near term given entrenched political opposition and Republican legislative supermajorities.

The 2027 legislative session (Texas legislators meet only in odd-numbered years) could revisit expansion, but political dynamics suggest continued resistance. Federal cuts to Medicaid and marketplace subsidies may increase pressure by destabilizing the existing safety net, but could also strengthen arguments that Medicaid is an unsustainable program best avoided.

For the 617,000+ Texans in the coverage gap, the work requirement debate in other states is academic. Their challenge is not meeting verification requirements but convincing their state to offer them coverage in the first place.
