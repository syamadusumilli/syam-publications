## Work Requirement History

Virginia has direct prior experience with work requirement policy development, though it never implemented requirements.

In June 2018, Virginia expanded Medicaid through a budget compromise that included a work requirement provision. Republican legislators, led by Delegate Chris Jones of Suffolk and Senator Emmett Hanger of Augusta, secured work requirement language as a condition of their votes for expansion. The compromise legislation directed the Department of Medical Assistance Services to submit a Section 1115 waiver application including community engagement requirements.

DMAS developed the Virginia COMPASS (Creating Opportunities for Medicaid Participants to Achieve Self-Sufficiency) waiver application through fall 2018. After public comment revealing substantial opposition (thousands of comments, overwhelmingly critical) and negotiations with Republican legislators concerned about exemption breadth, DMAS submitted the waiver to CMS in November 2018, two weeks past the statutory deadline due to ongoing Republican objections.

The COMPASS proposal included graduated hour requirements: 20 hours monthly for the first three months, increasing to 40, 60, and ultimately 80 hours by month 12. The design included housing and employment supports for behavioral health populations. The state estimated approximately 120,000 enrollees would be subject to requirements.

DMAS explicitly addressed concerns raised by Arkansas's early experience, proposing a "no wrong door" reporting policy to accommodate limited broadband access in rural areas. The application noted that Virginia lacked "perfect broadband access in every area of the commonwealth."

However, the waiver never received CMS approval. Democrats swept Virginia's 2019 elections, taking control of both chambers of the General Assembly. In December 2019, new DMAS leadership notified CMS that Virginia was formally pausing work requirement negotiations. During the 2020 legislative session, the Democratic majority eliminated COMPASS requirements from the state budget. Governor Ralph Northam officially withdrew the waiver application in July 2020.

The withdrawal occurred before the Biden administration's formal rescission of all work requirement waivers in 2021. Virginia's decision was politically motivated rather than legally compelled.

## Current Policy and Waiver Status

**No Current Work Requirement Waiver**

Virginia has not submitted a new Section 1115 waiver application for work requirements. Unlike states actively seeking early implementation (Georgia's ongoing program, or pending applications from Iowa, Louisiana, Montana, Oklahoma, Texas, and Wisconsin), Virginia is not pursuing waiver-based work requirements ahead of the federal mandate.

The state's current 1115 demonstration, "Building and Transforming Coverage, Services, and Supports for a Healthier Virginia," focuses on substance use disorder treatment (through the ARTS program) and coverage for former foster care youth. A renewal application was submitted in August 2024 for the five-year period through December 2029. An amendment adding serious mental illness IMD coverage was under consideration in late 2024. Neither addresses work requirements.

**OB3 Federal Mandate**

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act's passage in July 2025 requires Virginia to implement work requirements for expansion adults by January 1, 2027, or seek extension through December 31, 2028, subject to HHS Secretary approval. DMAS Director Cheryl Roberts has indicated the state is awaiting CMS guidance before making implementation decisions, noting that specific federal requirements remain undefined.

Roberts stated in July 2025 that the approximately 600,000+ expansion adults would become subject to work requirements and twice-yearly eligibility verification. She acknowledged the "significant" workload implications for the Department of Social Services and local agencies.

**Political Transition**

Governor Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, completed his term in January 2026. Youngkin publicly framed work requirements as "important" Medicaid reform, emphasizing that the program should serve the "deeply impoverished," mothers, and children rather than "able-bodied people who can get a job and have simply chosen not to."

The November 2025 gubernatorial election produced a Democratic sweep. Former Congresswoman Abigail Spanberger defeated Lieutenant Governor Winsome Earle-Sears by approximately 15 percentage points, the largest Democratic margin since 1961. Democrats also won the lieutenant governor (State Senator Ghazala Hashmi) and attorney general (former Delegate Jay Jones) races. Spanberger takes office January 17, 2026.

During the campaign, Spanberger sponsored legislation to expand Medicaid eligibility and improve rural healthcare access. Earle-Sears supported work requirements conceptually but did not release a comprehensive implementation plan. Neither candidate provided detailed responses when asked about infrastructure requirements for work requirement compliance.

The new Democratic administration will oversee work requirement implementation despite the party's general opposition to the policy. Spanberger inherits a federal mandate that cannot be avoided without forfeiting Medicaid expansion.

## Defining Characteristics

**Decentralized Administration**

Virginia's 120 local Departments of Social Services administer Medicaid eligibility determinations. This decentralized structure creates 120 potential implementation variations and substantial coordination challenges. A 2024 state-commissioned study found that only 11% of local agencies complete the majority of applications within the federally required 45-day timeline. Virginia ranks among the ten slowest states nationally for Medicaid application processing.

The eligibility IT system, built in the late 1990s, lacks flexibility for modification, requires substantial manual processing, and cannot easily accommodate new verification requirements. The study described the system as "outdated and inefficient, making upgrades costly and difficult."

This infrastructure deficit creates acute implementation risk. Other states with prior work requirement experience built verification systems over years. Virginia must build or adapt systems in approximately 14 months while CMS guidance remains incomplete.

**Managed Care Consolidation**

Virginia operates Medicaid through managed care organizations under the Cardinal Care program (launched July 2025, consolidating the former Medallion 4.0 and CCC Plus programs). Five MCOs currently serve the expansion population: Aetna Better Health of Virginia, Anthem HealthKeepers Plus, Humana Healthy Horizons (replacing Molina as of July 2025), Sentara Community Plan, and UnitedHealthcare Community Plan.

MCOs have existing member communication channels and care coordination capacity that could support work requirement navigation. However, MCOs are simultaneously managing the Cardinal Care transition and consolidation, creating organizational bandwidth constraints.

A 2023 secret shopper survey found that 95% of calls seeking prenatal care appointments through MCO provider directories did not result in available appointments within state standards, raising questions about MCO-reported network adequacy. Whether MCOs can effectively support work requirement compliance when basic access appointment availability appears limited warrants attention.

**Rural Infrastructure Gaps**

Southwest Virginia faces particularly acute implementation challenges. The region has the highest Medicaid enrollment rates, lowest employment opportunity, limited broadband access, and designated healthcare shortage areas. Approximately 90% of Southwest Virginia counties lack adequate mental health professionals. Twelve rural hospitals have closed or stopped inpatient services since 2005.

Virginia's Rural Health Transformation Initiative attempts to address healthcare access gaps through telehealth expansion and innovative delivery models. However, broadband infrastructure remains inadequate in many rural areas, limiting digital verification options.

The "no wrong door" principle that DMAS proposed in its 2018 COMPASS application remains relevant. Residents in Buchanan, Dickenson, or Lee counties cannot be expected to complete monthly online verification if they lack reliable internet access.

**Federal Workforce Disruption**

Virginia's unique exposure to federal workforce disruption adds implementation complexity. The 2025 DOGE-initiated layoffs and the November 2025 government shutdown concentrated economic effects in Northern Virginia, where approximately 300,000 federal workers reside. Some federal employees terminated during workforce reductions may qualify for Medicaid while seeking new employment, creating enrollment churn during the implementation period.

The Spanberger victory was attributed partly to federal workforce anger over layoffs and the ongoing shutdown. This political environment may shape administrative priorities regarding how aggressively work requirements are enforced.

## Expected Policy Posture and Timeline

**Anticipated Approach: Uncertain, Potentially Reluctant Implementation**

Virginia's implementation philosophy remains undefined as the Spanberger administration prepares to take office. Several factors suggest reluctant compliance rather than aggressive enforcement:

The incoming Democratic administration ideologically opposes work requirements. Spanberger sponsored Medicaid expansion legislation as a member of Congress. The administration has no political incentive to demonstrate work requirements' effectiveness.

The state's prior COMPASS development, while never implemented, created policy analysis recognizing the administrative burden challenges. The "no wrong door" principle and concerns about broadband access remain relevant.

The decentralized administrative structure makes consistent enforcement difficult. Even if state leadership wanted aggressive implementation, 120 local DSS offices with varying capacity and political environments would produce inconsistent results.

However, the federal mandate leaves limited room for non-compliance. Virginia cannot simply decline to implement work requirements without losing the 90% federal match for expansion adults. The administration must build verification and exemption systems regardless of ideology.

**Coverage Loss Projections**

KFF projects approximately 210,000 Virginians could lose Medicaid over ten years due to work requirement changes. The Virginia Association of Free and Charitable Clinics expects the number to be larger because recent Senate amendments extended work requirements to parents with children over 14.

Governor Youngkin disputed these projections, claiming "not a single Virginian is losing access to Medicaid or getting kicked off the program." This optimistic assessment depends on all currently enrolled individuals either meeting work requirements or qualifying for exemptions, an outcome inconsistent with experience from Arkansas and other states.

**Timeline Constraints**

January 1, 2027 deadline requires:
- CMS guidance (expected by June 2026)
- System development or modification for verification
- Staff training across 120 local agencies
- Communication to 600,000+ expansion adults
- Exemption process development
- MCO coordination

October 1, 2027 brings twice-yearly redetermination requirements, doubling eligibility workload.

The Spanberger administration takes office January 17, 2026, with less than 12 months until the January 2027 deadline. Whether the state requests extension to December 2028 depends on infrastructure readiness assessments that have not yet occurred.

## Summary: What Virginia Is Expected to Do

Virginia will implement federal work requirements for its 600,000+ expansion adults, but approach remains undetermined as a new Democratic administration takes office weeks before system development must accelerate.

The state's prior COMPASS development experience provides policy framework but no operational infrastructure. The decentralized administration across 120 local agencies, outdated IT systems, and rural infrastructure gaps create substantial execution risk. KFF projects 210,000 coverage losses over a decade; the administration disputes these figures without providing alternatives.

The Spanberger administration faces an implementation dilemma: federal compliance requires building verification systems the new leadership ideologically opposes. The most likely outcome is compliant but reluctant implementation emphasizing exemption breadth and avoiding enforcement that maximizes coverage losses.

Southwest Virginia, with the highest Medicaid enrollment, weakest labor markets, and least digital infrastructure, will test whether work requirements can function without geographic concentration of coverage losses. The federal workforce disruption in Northern Virginia adds unpredictable enrollment dynamics during the implementation period.

Virginia offers a case study in implementation by an administration opposed to the underlying policy. Whether reluctant implementers can build systems that technically comply with federal requirements while minimizing coverage losses through generous exemptions and navigation support will determine outcomes.

## Cross-Program Context

**SNAP Coordination**

Virginia administers SNAP through the same local DSS offices that handle Medicaid eligibility. SNAP ABAWD work requirements already apply to able-bodied adults without dependents. Integration opportunity exists to coordinate verification across programs, reducing duplicative burden.

However, SNAP error rate concerns complicate coordination. OB3 imposes state matching requirements for SNAP based on payment error rates. Virginia's current 11.5% error rate substantially exceeds the 6% threshold triggering state cost-sharing. Administrative focus on reducing SNAP errors may compete with work requirement implementation priorities.

**TANF Integration**

Virginia's TANF program (Virginia Initiative for Employment Not Welfare, VIEW) includes work requirements for a different population. Some administrative infrastructure and lessons exist but have not been adapted for Medicaid scale.

**Provider Tax Vulnerability**

OB3's provider tax caps will reduce Virginia's ability to fund the state share of Medicaid expansion. Virginia currently relies on hospital assessments above the levels OB3 will permit. The gradual reduction from 6% to 3.5% over five years beginning FY2028 threatens funding for directed payments that supplement hospital Medicaid reimbursement rates.

Rural hospitals already operating at losses face compounding pressures from provider tax caps, potential work requirement coverage losses, and ongoing Medicaid rate inadequacy.

**Marketplace Fallback**

Virginia operates its own state-based marketplace, having transitioned from HealthCare.gov in January 2024. Expansion adults losing Medicaid may qualify for marketplace coverage with premium tax credits, though the December 2025 expiration of enhanced ACA subsidies creates affordability concerns.

The marketplace system automatically checks Medicaid eligibility before marketplace enrollment. A person determined Medicaid-eligible by the automated check cannot enroll in subsidized marketplace coverage, even if administrative errors prevent actual Medicaid enrollment. This creates a potential coverage gap for individuals churned off Medicaid who cannot immediately re-enroll.
