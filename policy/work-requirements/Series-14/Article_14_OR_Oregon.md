## Work Requirement History

Oregon has never implemented Medicaid work requirements and has no prior waiver experience to draw upon. The state's approach to Medicaid has moved in the opposite direction: reducing administrative barriers, extending enrollment periods, and integrating services across physical, mental, and oral health.

**The Oregon Model**

Oregon pioneered health care delivery transformation beginning in the early 1990s under Governor John Kitzhaber, an emergency physician who designed the Oregon Health Plan to ration services explicitly based on clinical effectiveness rather than excluding populations. The original plan prioritized prevention and primary care while accepting that not all possible services could be covered for all possible conditions.

In 2012, Oregon received federal approval for its Coordinated Care Organization (CCO) model, creating locally governed networks that integrate physical, behavioral, and oral health services under a single global budget. CCOs receive capitated payments with growth limited to a fixed rate, creating incentives to improve population health rather than simply increase service volume. Fifteen CCOs now operate across the state, with CareOregon and Health Share serving the largest populations.

The CCO model represents a fundamentally different philosophy than work requirements. Where work requirements emphasize individual accountability through compliance verification, Oregon's approach emphasizes system accountability through health outcomes. CCOs are measured on quality metrics and population health indicators, not on how efficiently they can process eligibility paperwork.

**Administrative Burden Reduction**

For nearly two decades, Oregon has focused on reducing administrative barriers to coverage. Key policies include two-year enrollment periods for adults (rather than annual renewals), continuous enrollment for children through age six, and streamlined renewal processes using available data to minimize paperwork requirements.

This approach achieved results. Oregon maintained one of the lowest uninsured rates nationally and reduced the administrative "churn" that causes people to cycle on and off coverage, creating care disruptions and administrative costs for both states and health plans.

Federal work requirements fundamentally contradict this design philosophy. Requiring monthly reporting of work activities, implementing six-month eligibility renewals, and building verification infrastructure inverts Oregon's entire approach.

## Current Policy and Waiver Status

**Political Landscape**

Governor Tina Kotek (D) has been vocally opposed to federal work requirements. In response to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act's passage, Kotek stated she was "outraged by the proposed Medicaid cuts" and warned that coverage losses would hurt families and the state's healthcare system.

Oregon's congressional delegation splits along partisan lines. The state's lone Republican, Representative Cliff Bentz, serves on the House subcommittee responsible for Medicaid provisions in the reconciliation bill and has stated he helped craft its requirements. Bentz represents Oregon's 2nd Congressional District in eastern Oregon, where 38% of residents are on Medicaid, one of the highest rates of any congressional district nationally.

Democrats control the state legislature with comfortable majorities, ensuring that any implementation will be designed to minimize coverage losses rather than emphasize enforcement.

**Preparation Activities**

Governor Kotek has convened an 18-member Medicaid workgroup to advise on managing the federal funding crisis. The group, composed of CCO executives, hospital representatives, labor unions, and healthcare providers, meets privately every two weeks with recommendations due by July 2026. The closed-door nature has drawn criticism from transparency advocates, though supporters argue the sensitive financial deliberations require confidential discussion.

Oregon Health Authority Medicaid Director Emma Sandoe has warned that implementing work requirement verification will require hiring 800 to 1,200 additional eligibility workers. Technology system updates and operational changes could cost upwards of $100 million. These costs must be absorbed while simultaneously managing reduced federal matching rates and provider tax restrictions.

**The Healthier Oregon Complication**

Oregon's Healthier Oregon program provides state-funded coverage to approximately 100,000 immigrants, including some with legal status and some without documentation. While federal Medicaid dollars do not fund this program, its existence created targeting by the original reconciliation bill, which included provisions penalizing states that cover undocumented immigrants.

The final bill removed this specific penalty, but Healthier Oregon illustrates Oregon's philosophical approach to coverage: expand eligibility where possible, reduce barriers to enrollment, and accept state fiscal responsibility where federal funds are unavailable. Work requirements represent the opposite philosophy, and implementing them requires Oregon to build administrative infrastructure fundamentally at odds with its existing systems.

## Defining Characteristics

**CCO Infrastructure as Both Asset and Challenge**

Oregon's CCO system provides substantial infrastructure for work requirement implementation, but also creates complexity. Each CCO maintains relationships with community-based organizations, social service agencies, and healthcare providers that could be leveraged for outreach and compliance support. The social needs service coordination systems that CCOs already operate for health-related social needs (housing, food, transportation) could theoretically be extended to employment verification.

However, CCOs are paid to improve health outcomes, not to verify work status. Diverting CCO resources toward administrative compliance creates opportunity costs for population health improvement. The global budget structure gives CCOs financial interest in maintaining enrollment, creating alignment between plan interests and coverage protection, but also potential tension with rigorous compliance enforcement.

CareOregon alone serves approximately one-third of Oregon Health Plan enrollees. Health Share of Oregon operates as the largest CCO in the Portland metro area. These organizations have the scale and technical capacity to support implementation but will need to balance their clinical mission against new administrative requirements.

**Rural and Frontier Realities**

Oregon's rural regions face compounded challenges. Primary care capacity in rural and remote areas meets only 69% of estimated need. Travel time to healthcare services, limited broadband access, and workforce shortages already strain rural health infrastructure.

Work requirements add another layer of burden. Rural residents have fewer formal employment opportunities, higher rates of seasonal and agricultural work, less access to the internet-based reporting systems urban residents can use, and greater distances to any in-person assistance. SNAP work requirements being implemented in 2025 will provide early evidence of how rural Oregonians manage monthly reporting obligations.

Eastern Oregon counties that have already lost substantial employment base face particular challenges. When jobs are scarce, meeting 80-hour monthly thresholds becomes difficult regardless of willingness to work. The federal exemptions for areas lacking sufficient employment may provide some relief, but qualification criteria and implementation remain uncertain.

**Tribal Populations and Sovereignty**

Oregon maintains government-to-government relationships with nine federally recognized tribes. Federal law exempts tribal members from Medicaid work requirements, but implementation of these exemptions creates administrative challenges.

Oregon recently became one of the first states approved to cover traditional tribal health practices through Medicaid, demonstrating the state's commitment to culturally appropriate care for Native American populations. CareOregon's Tribal Care Coordination program serves American Indians and Alaska Natives on fee-for-service Medicaid, providing navigation support that could help ensure tribal exemptions are properly applied.

The Urban Indian Health Program through NARA (Native American Rehabilitation Association) serves Native Americans in Portland and other urban areas who may not be enrolled in federally recognized tribes or whose tribes are not from Oregon. Ensuring these populations receive appropriate exemption processing requires coordination between state systems and tribal programs.

## Expected Implementation Approach

Oregon will implement federal work requirements by December 2026 with maximum use of exemptions and minimum verification burden. The Kotek administration will design systems to maintain coverage rather than maximize compliance enforcement.

**Likely Design Choices**

Oregon will almost certainly adopt the longest permissible reporting periods, accept the broadest range of qualifying activities, and automate exemption identification to the greatest extent feasible. Cross-program coordination with SNAP will allow deemed compliance for individuals already meeting food assistance work requirements.

The state will likely invest heavily in navigator and outreach infrastructure, leveraging CCO community health worker networks and existing community-based organization relationships. Given Oregon's experience with administrative burden reduction, the implementation design will emphasize presumptive eligibility maintenance rather than documentation-intensive verification.

**Capacity Constraints**

Oregon faces significant workforce constraints for implementation. The 800 to 1,200 additional eligibility workers needed represent a substantial hiring and training challenge within the 13-month timeline. The state is already experiencing healthcare workforce shortages; administrative workforce shortages may prove equally challenging.

Technology system modifications to the ONE Oregon eligibility system will require vendor coordination, testing, and rollout. Oregon's technology investments have focused on enrollment simplification; adding compliance verification represents a significant pivot in system purpose.

**Coverage Loss Projections**

Oregon Health Authority estimates up to 200,000 Oregonians could lose coverage over the next decade due to work requirement implementation. This projection reflects realistic assessment of documentation burden, administrative complexity, and inevitable processing failures.

Most coverage losses will occur among people who are actually working or who qualify for exemptions but cannot navigate the verification process. Oregon's 70%+ employment rate among OHP members means most are already meeting substantive requirements; the challenge is proving it monthly through bureaucratic systems.

## Cross-Program Context

**SNAP Work Requirements**

Oregon began implementing expanded SNAP work requirements in October 2025 for able-bodied adults without dependents in six counties (Multnomah, Washington, Clackamas, Yamhill, Benton, and Hood River). This early experience will provide data on compliance rates, administrative challenges, and coverage loss patterns before Medicaid requirements take effect.

SNAP exemptions for homeless individuals (24,300), former foster youth (209), and veterans (1,300) in May 2025 suggest the populations Oregon recognizes as requiring protection. Similar exemption structures for Medicaid would reflect state policy preferences.

**Provider Tax Restrictions**

Oregon relies significantly on provider taxes for Medicaid financing, with approximately one quarter of Oregon Health Plan funding derived from these sources. Federal restrictions requiring the current 6% provider tax to decline to 3.5% by 2032 will reduce state matching capacity, compounding work requirement impacts with financing constraints.

Rural hospitals, already operating on thin margins, face particular vulnerability. Coverage losses from work requirements combined with reduced provider tax revenue could accelerate rural hospital closures beyond the significant access problems Oregon already faces.

**Behavioral Health Investments**

Oregon has made substantial recent investments in behavioral health infrastructure, including $65 million for residential treatment capacity and workforce development scholarships. Governor Kotek has warned that work requirement coverage losses will undermine these investments by reducing the patient population that supports provider viability.

The state's higher-than-average youth substance use disorder rates and ongoing behavioral health workforce shortages create particular concern about coverage disruptions for populations requiring mental health and addiction services.

## Summary: What Oregon Is Expected to Do

Oregon will comply with federal work requirements while designing implementation to minimize coverage losses. The state's decades of investment in administrative burden reduction will be partially reversed, but the Kotek administration will use every available flexibility to protect coverage.

The CCO infrastructure provides implementation capacity but creates mission tension. Organizations designed to improve health outcomes will be required to verify employment status, diverting resources from clinical to administrative functions.

Oregon's experience will demonstrate what happens when work requirements are imposed on a state philosophically opposed to them. If Oregon achieves high compliance with minimal coverage loss, it suggests that resistant states can effectively mitigate federal requirements through implementation design. If Oregon experiences significant coverage losses despite best efforts, it indicates that work requirements cause harm regardless of state intent.

The rural-urban divide will shape outcomes. Portland metro residents with internet access, formal employment, and proximity to assistance will manage compliance more easily than eastern Oregon residents facing workforce shortages, limited connectivity, and vast distances to help.

Former Governor Kitzhaber's warning that work requirements represent "a big cost shifting scheme dressed up as accountability" will be tested against reality. Whether the administrative costs and coverage losses prove worth the claimed benefits of work encouragement remains the central question Oregon's implementation will help answer.
