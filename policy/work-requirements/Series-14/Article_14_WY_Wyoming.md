## Expansion Status: The State That Has Not

Wyoming is one of ten states that has not adopted Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. Despite more than a decade of legislative attempts, consistent Republican opposition has prevented expansion in every session. This posture makes Wyoming fundamentally different from other states in this series: the federal work requirement provisions of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act do not directly affect Wyoming because there is no expansion population to which they would apply.

The coverage gap in Wyoming contains approximately 9,000 people who earn too much to qualify for traditional Medicaid but too little to qualify for marketplace subsidies. These residents have no coverage option absent expansion or policy change. Another 10,000 people earning between 100% and 138% of the federal poverty level would qualify for enhanced marketplace subsidies under current federal policy, but if those subsidies expire after 2025, many would also become uninsured.

## Legislative History

Medicaid expansion bills have been introduced in the Wyoming Legislature nearly every year since 2013. The trajectory reveals consistent patterns:

**2013-2018:** Early expansion bills failed in committee without reaching floor votes. Governor Matt Mead, a Republican, publicly supported expansion but could not overcome legislative opposition. The state commissioned studies showing expansion would cover approximately 19,000 residents and reduce hospital uncompensated care by at least 30%.

**2019 Work Requirement Attempt:** House Bill 244 proposed Medicaid expansion with work requirements, seeking to make the policy more palatable to conservative legislators. The bill failed despite the work requirement provision, suggesting that opposition runs deeper than policy design.

**2021:** An expansion bill passed the House but failed in the Senate Labor, Health, and Social Services Committee.

**2022:** No expansion bill was introduced during the budget session.

**2023:** House Bill 80 passed out of the House Revenue Committee with bipartisan support, including amendments banning coverage for gender-affirming care and abortion. Committee Chair Steve Harshman (R-Casper) explained his shift to supporting expansion, saying he had "learned so much" and that "it's the right thing to do for the people." Despite this progress, the bill died without a floor vote in the full House.

**2024:** Senator Cale Case (R-Lander) brought budget amendments attempting to initiate expansion funding through lodging tax revenue. The amendments failed 7-23 and 5-26 in Senate votes. Case noted that colleagues who privately support expansion fear being "primaried" and "painted as a liberal."

**2025:** No Medicaid expansion bill was introduced by early February. Advocates continued educational efforts but acknowledged dim prospects in the current political environment.

## Why Wyoming Has Not Expanded

The persistent legislative opposition reflects several factors beyond generic conservative ideology:

**Anti-Federal Sentiment:** Wyoming's political culture emphasizes independence from federal government programs. Senator Bob Ide (R-Casper) characterized Medicaid as "essentially socialized medicine" and argued that "partnering with the federal government hasn't worked out." This skepticism exists even though 90% of expansion costs would be federally funded.

**Fiscal Conservatism in an Energy State:** Wyoming's reliance on mineral severance taxes creates revenue volatility. Legislators fear committing to expansion during boom periods and facing budget crises during busts. Despite the state's Permanent Mineral Trust Fund exceeding $11 billion, lawmakers resist new ongoing obligations.

**Small Population, Small Problem Perception:** With only 9,000 people in the coverage gap, the political pressure for expansion is limited. These 9,000 votes matter less than in states where hundreds of thousands lack coverage.

**Primary Election Dynamics:** In Wyoming's overwhelmingly Republican electorate, primary challenges from the right pose greater electoral risk than general election losses. Supporting expansion, even with work requirements, risks "Obamacare" attacks in Republican primaries.

**Hospital Influence Limitations:** Unlike states where major health systems drive policy through lobbying and campaign contributions, Wyoming's 33 hospitals are mostly small, rural facilities without concentrated political power. The Wyoming Hospital Association supports expansion but lacks leverage to compel legislative action.

## The Hypothetical: Wyoming Under Federal Work Requirements

If Wyoming were to expand Medicaid under the One Big Beautiful Bill framework, the work requirement provisions would apply to the expansion population. Several characteristics would shape implementation:

**Scale:** With approximately 19,000 projected expansion enrollees, Wyoming would have the smallest expansion population of any state implementing work requirements. This scale could enable personalized, relationship-based approaches impossible in states with hundreds of thousands of enrollees. Navigators might know enrollees by name.

**Geographic Barriers:** Work requirements assume access to employment, education, training, and community service opportunities that may not exist in frontier Wyoming. How does someone in remote Hot Springs County (population 4,500 across 2,000 square miles) find 80 hours monthly of qualifying activities? The nearest community college might be 100 miles away. Job training programs may not exist within reasonable travel distance.

**Digital Infrastructure Deficits:** Online reporting systems that work in urban areas may fail in Wyoming's many communities without reliable broadband. Self-attestation and telephone reporting would be essential, but capacity for telephone-based verification is limited.

**Seasonal Employment Patterns:** Wyoming's tourism and agriculture economies create highly seasonal employment. Gateway communities near Yellowstone and Grand Teton experience dramatic seasonal workforce fluctuations. Monthly verification would need to accommodate these patterns or risk disenrolling workers during off-seasons.

**Tribal Considerations:** The Wind River Reservation's approximately 12,500 tribal members would likely be exempt from work requirements under federal Indian law protections. However, the reservation's extreme poverty (unemployment historically 50-84%), health disparities (19% diabetes prevalence versus 8% statewide), and limited healthcare infrastructure (Indian Health Service facilities) create their own coverage challenges regardless of work requirements.

**Administrative Capacity:** The Wyoming Department of Health operates Medicaid as a fee-for-service program without managed care organizations. The state lacks the MCO infrastructure that other states rely upon for member engagement, care management, and compliance support. Building verification and exemption systems from scratch for a small population creates high per-capita administrative costs.

## Defining Characteristics

Wyoming's situation is defined by the smallest scale combined with the most extreme geography of any potential expansion state.

**No Managed Care Infrastructure:** Wyoming is one of few states that has not implemented Medicaid managed care. The state contracts directly with providers through fee-for-service arrangements. This means no MCO partners to share implementation burden, no care management infrastructure to engage members, and no existing member communication channels beyond eligibility notices. Building work requirement compliance systems would require either creating state capacity from scratch or implementing managed care simultaneously.

**Critical Access Hospital Dependence:** Of Wyoming's 33 hospitals, most are designated Critical Access Hospitals, small facilities that depend on cost-based Medicare reimbursement to remain viable. Uncompensated care costs exceed $120-150 million annually statewide. Medicaid expansion would reduce these costs substantially, but work requirements that suppress enrollment would limit the benefit. Hospitals have strong financial interest in expansion but have been unable to translate that interest into legislative success.

**Provider Shortages:** The entire state is designated a Mental Health Professional Shortage Area. Wyoming has 44 Primary Care Health Professional Shortage Areas. Only 41% of mental health needs are being met according to federal calculations. Provider capacity constraints would limit the healthcare benefit of expansion regardless of enrollment levels.

**Energy Economy Transition:** Coal production has declined precipitously, threatening communities in the Powder River Basin that have depended on mining jobs paying twice the state average. Workers losing these positions may need Medicaid coverage during transitions, but the political representatives of these communities remain among the strongest opponents of expansion.

**Maternity Care Deserts:** Five Wyoming hospitals have closed labor and delivery services in recent years: Kemmerer, Rawlins, Lander, Evanston, and Wheatland. Mothers in some communities must drive over 100 miles in potentially dangerous winter conditions to reach birthing facilities. Medicaid expansion would provide coverage for pregnant women in the coverage gap, but the lack of accessible maternity services limits the practical benefit.

## What Wyoming Is Expected to Do

Wyoming is expected to continue declining Medicaid expansion through at least the 2025-2026 legislative sessions. The political calculus has not fundamentally changed despite years of advocacy, hospital support, and public opinion favoring expansion.

If Wyoming eventually adopts expansion, work requirements would likely be part of the package. The 2019 work requirement expansion bill failed not because of the work requirement provision but despite it, suggesting that conservative legislators do not view work requirements as sufficient to make expansion acceptable. However, mandatory federal work requirements under OB3 remove the framing as a state policy choice and instead position work requirements as federal conditions Wyoming must accept.

**Potential Expansion Scenarios:**

*Expansion-Averse Status Quo:* Wyoming maintains current policy, leaving approximately 9,000 residents in the coverage gap with no pathway to coverage. Federal work requirement provisions remain irrelevant because there is no expansion population.

*Work Requirement-Enabled Expansion:* Federal work requirements provide political cover for expansion supporters to argue that this is no longer "Obamacare" but a work-conditioned program aligning with Wyoming values. The combination of federal mandate and 90% federal funding eventually overcomes legislative resistance.

*ACA Subsidy Expiration Catalyst:* If enhanced ACA subsidies expire after 2025, the approximately 11,000-20,000 Wyomingites currently receiving marketplace subsidies could lose affordable coverage options. This broader coverage crisis might shift political dynamics toward expansion as hospitals face dramatically increased uncompensated care.

**Implementation If Expansion Occurs:**

Wyoming would face unique implementation challenges: building verification infrastructure for a small population dispersed across vast geography, establishing exemption processes recognizing frontier realities, and engaging members without MCO partnership infrastructure. The state might seek federal flexibility for approaches tailored to frontier conditions, including heavy reliance on self-attestation, recognition of seasonal employment patterns, and extended good cause exemption periods for residents facing geographic barriers to qualifying activities.

The Wind River Reservation population would require separate coordination with tribal governments and Indian Health Service, likely resulting in blanket exemptions for tribal members consistent with federal policy in other program areas.

## Cross-Program Context

**SNAP and TANF:** Wyoming operates SNAP with ABAWD work requirements affecting a similar population to potential Medicaid expansion. Aligning SNAP and Medicaid work requirements through deemed compliance could reduce administrative burden, but no cross-program coordination infrastructure currently exists. TANF caseloads in Wyoming are small, limiting coordination opportunities.

**Veterans Affairs:** Wyoming has one of the highest per-capita veteran populations nationally. Veterans already receiving VA healthcare would likely be exempt from Medicaid work requirements, but the intersection of VA coverage, Medicaid eligibility, and work requirements creates administrative complexity for dual-eligible veterans in the coverage gap.

**Provider Taxes:** Wyoming implemented hospital and nursing facility provider taxes in 2011 and 2017 respectively to draw down additional federal matching funds. Potential federal caps on provider taxes under OB3 could threaten this revenue stream, further constraining state healthcare financing regardless of expansion decisions.

**Rural Health Transformation Program:** Wyoming submitted an application for up to $800 million from the federal Rural Health Transformation Program created under OB3. The application focuses on stabilizing rural hospitals, expanding workforce, promoting preventive health, and using technology to improve access. This federal investment could strengthen healthcare infrastructure that would support any future expansion implementation.

## Summary: Wyoming's Path Forward

Wyoming represents the limiting case for Medicaid work requirements: a state that has not expanded and shows limited political movement toward expansion regardless of federal policy changes. The federal work requirement mandate does not directly affect Wyoming because there is no expansion population to regulate.

However, federal work requirements may paradoxically improve expansion prospects by providing political cover for legislators who support coverage expansion but fear primary challenges. If expansion eventually occurs, Wyoming's extreme frontier geography and lack of managed care infrastructure would create distinctive implementation challenges requiring significant federal flexibility.

For now, approximately 9,000 Wyoming residents remain in the coverage gap with no pathway to healthcare coverage. The state's hospitals continue absorbing over $120 million annually in uncompensated care. And the political dynamics that have blocked expansion for more than a decade show no signs of fundamental change, regardless of what federal policy requires of states that have taken a different path.
