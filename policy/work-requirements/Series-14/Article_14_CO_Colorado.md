## Work Requirement History

Colorado has no prior Medicaid work requirement experience. The state expanded Medicaid effective January 1, 2014, among the earliest expansion states, and has not pursued Section 1115 waivers imposing community engagement requirements.

The absence of prior implementation means Colorado lacks both the lessons and the scars that states like Georgia, Arkansas, and Michigan carry into federal implementation. The state must build work requirement verification infrastructure from the ground up rather than adapting existing systems or correcting known failures.

## Current Policy and Waiver Status

**Federal Mandate Implementation**

Colorado will implement federally mandated work requirements effective January 1, 2027, under provisions of H.R. 1 (the One Big Beautiful Bill Act) signed July 4, 2025. The Department of Health Care Policy and Financing (HCPF) is developing implementation plans with explicit commitment to minimizing coverage loss.

HCPF has identified approximately 369,638 expansion adults potentially subject to work requirements, though substantial populations will qualify for exemptions including those with disabilities, pregnant and postpartum individuals, parents of young children, those entitled to Medicare, and seniors age 65 and over.

**State Policy Posture**

Governor Jared Polis and HCPF leadership have stated that Colorado will take "the least burdensome approach to work requirements that can be devised." This orientation reflects the administration's commitment to mitigating inappropriate coverage loss as its primary implementation objective, or "north star."

The state has characterized its approach as focused on maximizing automation, leveraging cross-program data, and minimizing documentation burden for enrollees. HCPF is designing a "Minimum Viable Product" for January 2027 launch, acknowledging that full system development within the compressed timeline is not feasible.

**Timeline**

- September 2025: HCPF published work requirements fact sheet and FAQ
- Fall 2025: Stakeholder engagement on system design
- 2026: System development, staff training, member communications
- January 2027: Work requirements take effect aligned with member renewal dates
- Ongoing: Semi-annual eligibility redeterminations begin

## Defining Characteristics

**The County-Administered Challenge**

Colorado's most distinctive characteristic is its state-supervised, county-administered Medicaid system. Unlike state-administered systems where a single agency handles all eligibility determinations, Colorado distributes this work across 64 county departments of human or social services plus designated Medical Assistance sites.

This structure creates both opportunities and challenges for work requirement implementation. Counties maintain direct relationships with enrollees and can leverage local knowledge and community connections for navigation support. However, the model fragments administrative capacity across jurisdictions with vastly different resources. Clear Creek County has a single employee managing enrollment for 1,500 Medicaid residents. Summit County supplements state administrative funding with approximately $1 million annually in local resources. Rural counties face workload impacts they cannot absorb without additional support.

The current state funding model for counties does not account for work requirement verification activities. Adding documentation review, exemption processing, and compliance monitoring to county workloads without corresponding funding increases will strain already limited capacity. HCPF estimates implementation could cost upwards of $57 million in administrative expenses, but securing state funding requires navigating Colorado's constrained budget environment.

**TABOR and Fiscal Constraints**

Colorado operates under the Taxpayer's Bill of Rights (TABOR), a constitutional provision limiting tax revenue growth and requiring voter approval for tax increases. This constraint, combined with balanced budget requirements, limits the state's flexibility to absorb federal cost shifts or fund administrative infrastructure.

H.R. 1's Medicaid provisions create significant fiscal pressure. Federal funding reductions through provider tax limitations could cost Colorado $900 million to $2.5 billion annually by fiscal year 2032. The $57 million administrative cost estimate for work requirements represents new expenses the state must absorb or secure county partners to finance. Governor Polis called a special session in August 2025 specifically to address the $1.2 billion budget shortfall created by federal policy changes.

These fiscal realities constrain Colorado's implementation options. The state cannot absorb federal cost shifts through tax increases without voter approval, and Colorado voters have historically rejected such proposals. The result is pressure to minimize administrative costs, which may favor maximizing automation over building robust human navigation infrastructure.

**Cross-Program Coordination Opportunity**

Colorado maintains one of the strongest cross-program coordination opportunities among expansion states. Approximately 85% of Medicaid expansion adults are active in SNAP as of July 2025. This overlap creates potential for leveraging SNAP work requirement compliance documentation for Medicaid purposes.

H.R. 1 requires states to leverage existing information for work requirement verification wherever possible, known as "ex parte" verification. If Colorado can successfully implement data sharing between SNAP and Medicaid, the majority of expansion adults could demonstrate compliance through automated systems rather than individual documentation submissions.

The technical infrastructure partially exists. Colorado's integrated Colorado Benefits Management System (CBMS) handles both Medicaid and SNAP eligibility, though the system is widely acknowledged as outdated and in need of modernization. The Joint Agency InterOperability (JAI) project, targeting implementation in 2026-2027, aims to advance county consistency through shared tools supporting eligibility task management across programs.

**Managed Care Landscape**

Colorado's Accountable Care Collaborative (ACC) serves as the primary delivery system for Health First Colorado. Regional Accountable Entities (RAEs) administer behavioral health benefits, establish provider networks, and coordinate care for members in their regions. ACC Phase III launched July 1, 2025, with new contracts and regional configurations.

The RAE structure provides infrastructure for member outreach and care coordination that could support work requirement navigation. Five private organizations operate as RAEs across Colorado's regions, with Rocky Mountain Health Plans covering the Western Slope and mountain regions, Colorado Access serving the Denver metro area, and other entities covering remaining regions.

Two managed care organizations (MCOs) operate full-risk capitated physical health plans in certain areas: Denver Health Medicaid Choice and Rocky Mountain Health Plans PRIME. These organizations have financial stakes in membership retention that align with coverage-protective implementation.

**Technology Infrastructure**

Colorado's CBMS system supports Medicaid and SNAP eligibility determination across county offices. However, the system has been criticized as outdated and clunky. During the post-pandemic Medicaid unwinding, technology limitations contributed to Colorado's nation-leading net enrollment decline of 48%, far exceeding most other states.

Automatic renewal (ex parte) rates have improved, with approximately 60% of renewals now processed without human intervention. However, this still leaves 40% requiring manual processing and member action, a proportion that may increase as work requirement verification adds complexity.

CMS has communicated that states need only have a functional "Minimum Viable Product" by January 2027 given the impossibility of building complete infrastructure in 14 months. Colorado is designing to this standard, prioritizing core verification and exemption processing functionality over comprehensive system integration.

**Political Environment**

Colorado's Democratic trifecta (governor, state Senate, state House) ensures that implementation design reflects administrative preferences rather than legislative mandates for restrictive approaches. Governor Polis has characterized work requirements as harmful federal policy Colorado must implement but will not amplify.

This political alignment provides implementation latitude that Republican-governed states may not have. The Polis administration can maximize exemption breadth, minimize reporting burden, and design appeals processes favoring enrollee retention without legislative interference. However, the 2026 elections create uncertainty; a Republican governor taking office in January 2027 could redirect implementation toward more restrictive approaches.

Advocacy organizations including the Colorado Fiscal Institute, Colorado Center on Law and Policy, and Colorado Consumer Health Initiative actively oppose work requirements and monitor implementation design. Provider organizations including the Colorado Hospital Association have stakes in coverage maintenance given rural hospital financial vulnerability.

## Projected Approach and Coverage Impact

**Coverage Loss Estimates**

Analysis by the Urban Institute projects that 95,000 to 108,000 Coloradans could lose Medicaid coverage under federal work requirements even though the vast majority already work, participate in qualifying activities, or meet exemption criteria. The Colorado Health Institute estimates similarly that paperwork barriers rather than actual work status would drive coverage losses. A higher estimate from HCPF analysis suggests up to 128,000 could lose coverage depending on implementation design.

These projections assume that nine in ten expansion adults ages 19-64 either work sufficient hours, participate in qualifying education or training, or meet exemption criteria. Coverage losses would occur primarily among individuals who cannot successfully navigate documentation requirements despite meeting substantive compliance criteria.

**Implementation Philosophy**

Colorado's stated commitment to least burdensome implementation suggests the state will pursue:

- Maximum automation using existing program data (SNAP, TANF, unemployment insurance)
- Broad exemption categories with proactive identification of exempt populations
- Extended cure periods before coverage termination
- Multiple reporting channels (online, phone, mail, in-person)
- Robust appeals processes with coverage continuation pending resolution
- County-based navigation support integrated with existing outreach

The county-administered structure creates implementation variability. Urban counties with more resources may achieve higher automatic verification rates and more effective member outreach than rural counties with limited staff. Whether the state can maintain statewide consistency while accommodating local capacity constraints will significantly affect outcomes.

## Cross-Program Context

**SNAP E&T Alignment**

Colorado operates SNAP Employment & Training programs that create infrastructure potentially adaptable for Medicaid work requirements. The 85% overlap between Medicaid expansion adults and SNAP enrollment creates the strongest cross-program coordination opportunity among large expansion states. If federal regulations permit automatic deemed compliance for SNAP participants meeting work requirements, most expansion adults could satisfy Medicaid requirements without additional documentation.

**TANF Work Requirements**

Colorado's TANF program includes work requirements administered through the same county human services departments handling Medicaid. Infrastructure and staff experience with TANF verification provides baseline capacity, though the expansion adult population subject to Medicaid requirements is substantially larger than the TANF population.

**Provider Tax Situation**

Colorado relies on hospital assessments administered through the Colorado Healthcare Affordability and Sustainability Enterprise (CHASE) for Medicaid financing. H.R. 1 provisions limiting provider tax arrangements will reduce available federal matching funds, tightening fiscal constraints. Coverage losses creating increased uncompensated care would compound financial pressure on hospitals, particularly the 44 rural and frontier facilities already operating without sustainable margins.

**Marketplace Infrastructure**

Connect for Health Colorado, the state-based health insurance marketplace, provides infrastructure for coverage transitions. Expansion adults losing Medicaid coverage may qualify for subsidized marketplace plans depending on income. The transition pathway is clearer than in federally facilitated marketplace states, though affordability concerns persist given Colorado's high healthcare costs.

## Summary: What Colorado Is Expected to Do

Colorado will implement federal work requirements with maximum available flexibility oriented toward coverage maintenance. The Polis administration's explicit commitment to mitigating inappropriate coverage loss establishes the policy direction; the question is whether administrative infrastructure can deliver on that commitment.

The state's primary advantage is cross-program data availability. With 85% SNAP overlap, Colorado has more capacity than most states to achieve automated verification without requiring individual documentation submissions. Success depends on whether CBMS modernization and JAI project timelines align with January 2027 requirements.

The primary challenge is county-administered fragmentation. Sixty-four counties with varying capacity must implement consistent verification and exemption processes. Small rural counties lack staff to absorb new administrative workload. State funding models do not account for work requirement activities. Without significant new investment, county capacity constraints may produce inconsistent outcomes across the state.

Geographic diversity compounds implementation complexity. Mountain resort communities with seasonal employment patterns face different challenges than Denver metro areas with stable year-round employment. Eastern plains agricultural communities present different documentation challenges than Western Slope service economies. Statewide policy must accommodate this variation.

Colorado's coverage loss estimates of 95,000 to 128,000 represent a significant proportion of the 370,000 expansion adults subject to requirements. Whether the state achieves outcomes closer to the low or high end of projections depends on implementation execution, county capacity, technology functionality, and member navigation support.

The state's fiscal constraints limit investment in navigation infrastructure that might reduce coverage losses. TABOR restrictions and balanced budget requirements leave little room for the county funding increases or community organization partnerships that could support enrollees through verification processes. Colorado may design coverage-protective policy while lacking resources to implement it effectively.
