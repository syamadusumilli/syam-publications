## Work Requirement History

Arizona has no prior Section 1115 Medicaid work requirement implementation. However, the state has relevant adjacent experience that informs current policy development.

**AHCCCS Jobs Initiative**

Arizona proposed the AHCCCS Jobs initiative in 2017, seeking CMS approval for community engagement requirements. The application was withdrawn in 2019 following federal court decisions vacating Arkansas and Kentucky waivers. The state never reached implementation, so no outcome data exists from Arizona's attempt.

The AHCCCS Jobs design included several elements that foreshadowed current federal requirements: 80 hours monthly of qualifying activities, exemptions for disability and caregiving, and verification through a combination of self-attestation and administrative data matching.

**TANF Work Requirements Experience**

Arizona operates Employment and Training (E&T) requirements for TANF recipients through the Jobs program administered by the Department of Economic Security. This experience provides the state with administrative infrastructure and workforce development partnerships, though the TANF population differs substantially from Medicaid expansion adults.

Key lessons from TANF implementation:
- Tribal coordination mechanisms already established
- Workforce development partnerships exist statewide
- Case management infrastructure tested
- Administrative data sharing agreements in place

**SNAP ABAWD Requirements**

Arizona enforces Able-Bodied Adults Without Dependents (ABAWD) work requirements for SNAP recipients. The overlap between SNAP ABAWD and Medicaid expansion populations creates coordination opportunities and risks of duplicative burden for individuals subject to both requirements.

## Current Policy and Waiver Status

**March 2025 Waiver Amendment**

AHCCCS submitted a Section 1115 waiver amendment on March 31, 2025, requesting authority to implement community engagement requirements for the Medicaid expansion population. The application reflects deliberate design choices informed by other states' experiences.

Key design elements:

*Population Scope:* The waiver covers adults ages 19-64 enrolled in AHCCCS through the Affordable Care Act expansion category. Traditional Medicaid populations (children, pregnant women, elderly, disabled) are excluded.

*Hour Requirements:* Aligned with federal requirements, the proposal specifies 80 hours monthly of qualifying activities including employment, education, job training, job search, community service, and substance use disorder treatment participation.

*Exemption Categories:* Arizona's proposal includes exemptions for pregnancy (through 60 days postpartum), medical frailty, disability, full-time students, caregivers of children under six or dependents with disabilities, individuals receiving unemployment benefits, participants in substance use disorder treatment, and members residing on tribal lands.

*Tribal Provisions:* Recognizing tribal sovereignty and the unique circumstances of reservation populations, the waiver includes provisions for tribal exemptions and potential tribal administration of requirements for members residing on tribal lands.

*Verification Approach:* AHCCCS proposes a hybrid verification model combining administrative data matching (unemployment insurance wage data, Social Security disability data, TANF/SNAP compliance data) with member self-attestation for activities not captured in administrative systems.

**Legislative Activity**

House Bill 2724, introduced in the 2025 legislative session, provides state statutory authority for work requirement implementation. The bill passed the Arizona House and Senate with bipartisan support, reflecting the state's generally favorable posture toward work-related program conditions.

**Administrative Rulemaking**

AHCCCS has initiated administrative rulemaking to establish verification procedures, exemption documentation requirements, and appeals processes. The agency conducted stakeholder listening sessions in April and May 2025, with particular attention to tribal government input.

## Defining Characteristics

**Tribal Sovereignty and Federal Indian Law**

Arizona's implementation must navigate federal Indian law principles that no other state faces at comparable scale. The 22 federally recognized tribes in Arizona operate as sovereign nations with government-to-government relationships with both state and federal authorities.

Several legal and practical considerations shape tribal approaches:

*Automatic Exemption Option:* The waiver application proposes automatic exemptions for members residing on tribal lands, acknowledging that employment opportunities, transportation infrastructure, and verification mechanisms operate differently in tribal communities.

*Tribal Administration Alternative:* For tribes preferring to implement work requirements rather than exempt their members, the waiver authorizes tribal administration. This would allow tribes to design culturally appropriate qualifying activities and verification systems.

*Indian Health Service Integration:* Many tribal members receive healthcare through Indian Health Service facilities rather than AHCCCS-contracted providers. Coordination between IHS and AHCCCS creates administrative complexity but also opportunity for integrated care management.

*Data Sovereignty:* Tribal governments maintain data sovereignty over member information. Administrative data matching for verification requires tribal consent and may not be available for all tribal populations.

The Navajo Nation, spanning three states with approximately 175,000 enrolled members, will require particular coordination given its size and geographic complexity.

**Border State Economics**

Arizona's 83-mile border with Mexico creates employment patterns unlike other expansion states. Several dynamics affect work requirement implementation:

*Cross-Border Employment:* Some Arizona residents work in Mexico and vice versa. Wage data may not capture cross-border employment, and pay stubs from Mexican employers may be difficult to verify.

*Seasonal Agricultural Fluctuation:* The Yuma agricultural region produces 90% of U.S. winter leafy vegetables. Employment peaks November through March, then drops dramatically. Workers employed 60+ hours weekly during harvest season may have zero agricultural hours in summer months.

*Port of Entry Employment:* Border crossing commerce generates employment in customs, logistics, and retail that fluctuates with trade policy and inspection wait times.

*Remittance Patterns:* Some border region residents receive financial support from family members in Mexico, which affects income calculations but not work hour verification.

**AHCCCS Managed Care Infrastructure**

Unlike states operating traditional Medicaid, Arizona has delivered virtually all Medicaid services through managed care since 1982. AHCCCS was created explicitly as a managed care demonstration, making it the oldest statewide Medicaid managed care program nationally.

This infrastructure provides implementation advantages:

*MCO Administrative Capacity:* Arizona's MCOs have decades of experience with eligibility verification, care management, and compliance monitoring. Work requirement administration can build on existing systems rather than starting from scratch.

*Integrated Data Systems:* AHCCCS maintains comprehensive enrollment and encounter data across all MCOs, enabling coordinated verification and exemption identification.

*Care Coordination Workforce:* MCOs employ care coordinators who already contact members for health-related purposes. These touchpoints can incorporate work requirement education and support.

*Performance-Based Contracting:* AHCCCS contracts with MCOs include performance metrics and incentive payments. Work requirement outcomes could be incorporated into MCO accountability.

Arizona contracts with several major MCOs for expansion adult coverage: Arizona Complete Health (Centene), Banner-University Family Care, Care1st Health Plan (Blue Cross Blue Shield), Health Choice Arizona (Steward Health Care), Mercy Care (Aetna), and UnitedHealthcare Community Plan.

**Urban-Rural-Tribal Divide**

Arizona's geography creates three distinct implementation contexts requiring different approaches:

*Urban Maricopa/Pima:* Phoenix and Tucson have robust employment markets, public transportation (though limited compared to eastern cities), and dense service infrastructure. Most expansion adults can access qualifying activities within reasonable distance.

*Rural Arizona:* Counties like Cochise, Graham, Greenlee, and Gila have limited employment opportunities, no public transportation, and sparse service infrastructure. A resident in rural Cochise County may be 60+ miles from the nearest workforce development center.

*Tribal Lands:* Reservations face the most severe infrastructure limitations. Unemployment rates on some reservations exceed 50%. Transportation may require personal vehicles on unpaved roads. Internet access for online verification is unreliable. Employment opportunities concentrate in tribal government and gaming operations.

These three contexts cannot share a single implementation model. What works in Phoenix fails in Kayenta.

## Expected Policy Posture and Timeline

**Anticipated Approach: Pragmatic Moderate**

Arizona's implementation philosophy appears pragmatic rather than ideological. The state's design choices suggest priority on workable systems over enforcement maximization:

*Tribal Exemptions as Default:* Rather than attempting verification on reservations where infrastructure makes compliance structurally difficult, Arizona defaults to exemption. This acknowledges reality rather than imposing requirements that cannot be met.

*Data Matching Priority:* The emphasis on administrative data matching reduces member burden and leverages existing systems. Members whose employment appears in unemployment insurance wage data may never need to take any action.

*MCO Integration:* Routing work requirement support through existing MCO care coordination embeds compliance assistance in healthcare relationships members already have, rather than creating parallel bureaucracy.

*Seasonal Accommodation:* Agricultural worker provisions recognize that seasonal employment doesn't produce consistent monthly hours. How Arizona handles the Yuma lettuce worker employed 60 hours weekly in February and zero hours in July will test the system's flexibility.

**Timeline**

- March 2025: Waiver amendment submitted
- April-May 2025: Stakeholder listening sessions
- Summer 2025: Administrative rulemaking
- Fall 2025: CMS negotiation and approval
- Late 2025: MCO contract modifications and system development
- First half 2026: Pilot implementation and testing
- December 2026: Full implementation aligned with federal deadline

**Key Uncertainties**

*Tribal Coordination:* Whether all 22 tribes will accept automatic exemptions or some will prefer tribal administration remains unclear. Negotiations with tribal governments are ongoing.

*Agricultural Worker Treatment:* The waiver application acknowledges seasonal employment patterns but does not specify how monthly hour requirements will accommodate workers with legitimately variable hours.

*Cross-Border Verification:* How Arizona will verify employment for workers whose wages are paid by Mexican employers, or whose work occurs across the border, is not specified in the waiver application.

*Navigator Infrastructure:* Unlike Arkansas's Success Coach model, Arizona's application does not describe extensive navigator infrastructure. Whether MCO care coordinators can provide adequate compliance support, or whether additional navigation capacity is needed, will affect outcomes.

## Summary: What Arizona Is Expected to Do

Arizona will implement work requirements through its established AHCCCS managed care infrastructure, leveraging decades of experience with eligibility verification and care management. The state's approach is pragmatic rather than punitive: tribal populations will receive automatic exemptions rather than face verification requirements impossible to meet on reservations; administrative data matching will identify compliance for many members without requiring action; MCO care coordinators will integrate work requirement support into existing health-related outreach.

The critical test cases will be populations whose circumstances don't fit administrative categories. The Yuma agricultural worker with dramatic seasonal hour variation. The Phoenix gig worker whose DoorDash and Uber income doesn't appear in wage data. The Tucson resident caring for an elderly parent whose caregiving doesn't generate documentation. The refugee family in Phoenix unfamiliar with American administrative systems.

Arizona's managed care infrastructure provides implementation capacity other states lack, but infrastructure alone doesn't determine outcomes. Whether the state can translate administrative capacity into maintained coverage depends on how flexibly the system accommodates circumstances that don't match standard verification categories.

The tribal provisions will be closely watched. If automatic exemptions function as intended, approximately 50,000-70,000 Native American expansion adults will continue coverage without work requirement burden. If tribal administration alternatives develop, they may provide models for culturally appropriate approaches other states with smaller tribal populations could adapt.

## Cross-Program Context

**SNAP ABAWD Coordination**

Arizona operates SNAP ABAWD requirements for overlapping populations. The state has the opportunity to align verification systems and recognize compliance across programs. An expansion adult meeting SNAP work requirements should not need to separately verify Medicaid compliance. Whether the waiver and administrative rules achieve this deemed compliance remains to be confirmed.

**TANF Work Requirements**

Arizona's TANF Jobs program serves a different population (primarily families with children receiving cash assistance) but shares workforce development infrastructure. Employment services, job training providers, and case management systems developed for TANF can support Medicaid work requirement implementation.

**Housing Assistance**

Arizona does not currently impose work requirements on Section 8 or public housing recipients, though federal proposals may change this. If housing work requirements are added, integration or duplication with Medicaid requirements would create compounding burden.

**Provider Tax Situation**

Arizona relies moderately on provider taxes for Medicaid financing. Hospital and nursing facility assessments support AHCCCS funding. If work requirements cause significant coverage losses, hospitals serving uninsured populations would face increased uncompensated care, potentially destabilizing facilities already operating on thin margins.

**Marketplace Infrastructure**

Arizona operates on the federally facilitated marketplace (Healthcare.gov). If expansion adults lose Medicaid eligibility due to work requirement noncompliance, marketplace coverage with premium tax credits may be available depending on income. However, the churn between Medicaid and marketplace coverage creates gaps and administrative complexity.
