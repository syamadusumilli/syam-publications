## Work Requirement History

Maine has direct experience with work requirement policy debates, though it never implemented approved requirements. The state's trajectory illustrates how executive transitions can fundamentally alter implementation pathways.

**LePage Administration Approach**

Former Governor Paul LePage (R) pursued work requirements aggressively during his two terms (2011-2019). The LePage administration submitted an 1115 waiver to CMS in summer 2017 requesting work requirements for Medicaid recipients. The waiver proposed 20 hours weekly of work, volunteering, or job training as a condition of continued eligibility.

The Trump administration's CMS approved Maine's waiver in December 2018, just weeks before LePage left office. The approval came alongside similar approvals for Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, New Hampshire, and Michigan during the same period. Maine's approved waiver would have required able-bodied adults to demonstrate qualifying activities to maintain coverage.

Simultaneously, LePage refused to implement Medicaid expansion despite Maine voters approving it through a 2017 ballot initiative, the first state to expand Medicaid by referendum. LePage argued the state must identify funding before proceeding, while expansion advocates noted federal funding covered 90% of costs. The impasse persisted through the end of his administration.

**Mills Administration Reversal**

Janet Mills (D) took office January 2019 and immediately reversed both LePage policies. Her first executive order, signed January 3, 2019, directed DHHS to implement Medicaid expansion no later than February 1, 2019. Maine became the 33rd state to expand Medicaid, with coverage retroactive to July 2018 for those who had already applied.

On January 22, 2019, Mills sent a letter to CMS Administrator Seema Verma formally rejecting the approved 1115 waiver and its work requirements. Her letter articulated several concerns that prefigured the challenges now facing all expansion states.

Mills argued that Maine's specific characteristics made work requirements problematic: the state's low unemployment rate meant most who could work already were; the widely dispersed population created verification and compliance barriers; and Maine's lowest-per-capita income in New England meant the populations subject to requirements faced multiple constraints beyond work readiness.

The Governor predicted that work requirements would leave more Mainers uninsured without improving workforce participation, citing early results from Arkansas where thousands lost coverage without employment gains. She expressed concern about administrative burden for both enrollees and the state apparatus required for verification.

Rather than mandates, Mills directed the Departments of Labor and Health and Human Services to make vocational training and workforce supports available to MaineCare participants voluntarily. The state withdrew its waiver application, and the work requirement policy was abandoned before implementation.

**Lessons from the Reversal**

Maine's experience demonstrated that approved waivers do not guarantee implementation. Executive transitions can fundamentally alter state policy direction even after federal approval. The incoming administration's philosophical orientation toward work requirements as barriers versus pathways determines implementation approach.

Mills articulated a theory of change that viewed health coverage as prerequisite to, rather than reward for, workforce participation. This framing influenced her administration's preference for supportive services over compliance requirements, an approach she maintained through 2025.

## Current Policy and Waiver Status

**Federal Requirements**

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OB3) eliminated state discretion on work requirements for expansion adults. Beginning December 31, 2026, all states must implement 80 hours monthly of work, education, training, or community service for expansion adults aged 19-64 who do not qualify for exemptions.

Maine DHHS estimates approximately 90,000 expansion adults will be subject to work requirements. Of these, the state projects more than 31,000 could lose coverage during the first year of implementation, not necessarily because they fail to meet requirements, but because of challenges with verification and reporting.

**State Administrative Response**

The Mills administration has been openly critical of the federal mandate while acknowledging the state must comply. In July 2025, DHHS Commissioner testimony noted serious concerns about implementation impacts, particularly for individuals with substance use disorder who represent a significant portion of the expansion population.

The state estimates one-time implementation costs of $8 million to establish verification and reporting systems, followed by $5.5 million annually beginning fiscal year 2027 for ongoing administration. These costs come as the state simultaneously faces broader Medicaid funding reductions estimated at $5.9 billion over ten years.

Maine DHHS has advocated for flexibility in federal implementation timelines, suggesting December 31, 2027 as an alternative effective date to allow adequate systems development. The state has also raised concerns about prospective work requirements that would require compliance before enrollment, arguing that individuals with SUD may need coverage to obtain documentation supporting exemption requests.

**Legislative Dynamics**

Maine's legislature (controlled by Democrats) rejected proposals for state-level work requirements during 2025 budget negotiations. Senate President Mattie Daughtry stated the legislature rejected similar reforms because of their potential to harm vulnerable Mainers. The state's policy preference remains supportive services over compliance mandates.

However, federal requirements override state preferences. Maine must now implement a policy its current government opposed and previously rejected when given the choice. This creates implementation dynamics where the administering agency disagrees philosophically with the mandate it must execute.

## Defining Characteristics

**Oldest and Most Rural**

Maine's demographic profile creates unique implementation challenges. As the nation's oldest state (median age 44.8) with the highest proportion of residents over 65 (23%), Maine's population includes many individuals aging into Medicare while their younger family members remain on Medicaid. The state's workforce is also older, with 8.2% of workers aged 65 and older, an 18% increase in recent years.

The rural character compounds these challenges. Half of MaineCare enrollees live in rural areas where employment opportunities, transportation, and verification infrastructure are limited. Aroostook County residents may be 100 miles from the nearest city of significant size. Winter conditions create seasonal barriers that urban-focused policies may not anticipate.

**Healthcare Infrastructure Crisis**

Maine's hospital systems face severe financial strain that work requirements could worsen. Northern Light Health, the state's second-largest system, lost $120-140 million annually in recent years. The Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform projects half of Maine's 24 rural hospitals are at risk of closing. Northern Light Inland Hospital in Waterville closed in June 2025, citing monthly losses of $1-1.5 million.

Multiple hospitals have shuttered birthing centers, including facilities in Belfast, Houlton, and Bar Harbor. Walk-in clinics are closing across rural areas. Maine Family Planning discontinued primary care at three rural locations in 2025. The healthcare infrastructure that work requirements assume exists for verification, exemption documentation, and ongoing care is itself threatened.

MaineHealth and Northern Light Health receive significant revenue from MaineCare. Coverage losses from work requirements would increase uncompensated care for already struggling facilities. The state's hospital association has warned that proposed Medicaid cuts, combined with work requirement disenrollments, would push systems over a financial brink.

**Substance Use Disorder Prevalence**

Maine has among the highest rates of expansion members treated for SUD across all states. Over 31,000 expansion adults currently receive substance use disorder treatment through MaineCare. The Mills administration invested heavily in SUD treatment, expanding Medicaid coverage to provide treatment access, increasing medication-assisted treatment availability, and training hundreds of recovery coaches.

Work requirements create particular risks for this population. Individuals in early recovery may struggle to maintain 80 hours monthly of qualifying activities while attending treatment appointments, managing medication schedules, and rebuilding stability. Those not yet enrolled may face barriers obtaining coverage to support exemption documentation based on medical frailty or treatment status.

The state's opioid response strategy explicitly linked Medicaid expansion to improved SUD treatment access. Reversing this through work requirement disenrollments could undermine years of progress. Maine's Director of Opioid Response noted the implications are especially stark given continuing overdose deaths and the rise of multi-substance addiction.

**Seasonal Economy**

Maine's economy features significant seasonal variation that complicates monthly work hour verification. Tourism and hospitality peak in summer, lobster fishing runs May through December, forest products work is seasonal, and agriculture follows growing seasons. Workers in these industries may easily exceed 80 hours monthly during peak periods while falling short during off-seasons.

The lobster industry alone supports thousands of workers across fishing, processing, and distribution. These positions involve irregular hours, weather-dependent schedules, and cash compensation that may not produce standard documentation. Similar patterns affect tourism workers in destinations like Bar Harbor, where seasonal businesses struggle to find sufficient staff during summer months while offering little employment in winter.

**Fee-for-Service Structure**

Unlike states with mature managed care infrastructures, Maine operates MaineCare primarily through fee-for-service arrangements with a Primary Care Case Management program. The state lacks the MCO relationships that might otherwise provide verification infrastructure, member outreach, and navigation support. While legislation has been introduced to establish managed care, Maine currently lacks the intermediary organizations that handle work requirement administration in other states.

This means Maine must build verification and compliance monitoring systems at the state level without managed care partners to share administrative burden. The $8 million implementation estimate reflects this reality.

## Expected Policy Posture and Timeline

The Mills administration will implement work requirements by December 2026 while seeking maximum flexibility to minimize coverage losses. Several elements of the expected approach are clear.

First, Maine will pursue broad exemption interpretations for populations where the state can exercise discretion. Pregnant and postpartum exemptions, caregiver exemptions, and medical frailty determinations will likely receive generous implementation. The state's high SUD prevalence creates particular focus on treatment-related exemptions.

Second, verification systems will emphasize multiple reporting channels rather than digital-only options. Maine's rural population and aging demographics require telephone, mail, and in-person reporting pathways. The state recognized during the LePage-era debates that digital barriers would create disparate impacts.

Third, coordination with existing workforce development programs will attempt to convert compliance requirements into genuine employment pathways. CareerCenters throughout the state offer training referrals and job search assistance. The state will attempt to connect work requirement obligations with voluntary support services.

Fourth, the state will likely advocate for federal accommodations addressing seasonal employment patterns and rural geographic barriers. Whether such accommodations materialize depends on CMS rulemaking.

**Timeline**

- 2025-2026: System development, staff training, regulatory framework establishment
- Mid-2026: Member communications, reporting system activation
- December 31, 2026: Federal work requirement effective date
- 2027: First full year of implementation and enforcement

## Summary: What Maine Is Expected to Do

Maine will implement federal work requirements reluctantly, as a mandate the state's current government philosophically opposes. The Mills administration, which rejected work requirements when voluntary, must now execute them as federal law.

The state's implementation will emphasize coverage preservation through broad exemptions, multiple verification pathways, and coordination with voluntary workforce services. However, Maine's projected 31,000 first-year disenrollments suggests the state anticipates significant coverage losses regardless of implementation approach.

Maine's unique characteristics create particular vulnerabilities. The oldest, most rural state lacks the healthcare infrastructure to absorb coverage losses. Hospital systems already facing closure will see increased uncompensated care. Seasonal employment patterns create compliance challenges that monthly verification cannot easily accommodate. High SUD prevalence means work requirements affect a population whose recovery depends on coverage stability.

The state's fee-for-service Medicaid structure means implementation falls entirely to state government without managed care partners. Administrative costs compete with healthcare delivery during a period of constrained resources.

Maine represents the case of a blue state implementing red policy under federal mandate. The resulting implementation will reflect philosophical resistance translated into maximum flexibility within federal constraints. Whether this approach can prevent the coverage losses Maine projects remains uncertain. The state's experience will demonstrate whether supportive implementation can mitigate harms from policies the implementing government believes are fundamentally flawed.

## Cross-Program Context

**SNAP Employment & Training**

Maine operates SNAP employment and training programs that could provide verification pathways for Medicaid work requirements. If federal regulations permit deemed compliance for SNAP work requirement participants, coordination between programs could reduce duplicative documentation.

**Rural Health Fund**

Maine submitted an application to the federal $50 billion rural health fund created by OB3, seeking over $500 million over five years to offset Medicaid cuts. The fund cannot fully address projected losses but provides some healthcare infrastructure support during the implementation period.

**State Marketplace**

Maine operates CoverME, a state-based health insurance marketplace providing robust infrastructure for coverage transitions. Expansion adults losing Medicaid for work requirement noncompliance may qualify for marketplace coverage with subsidies depending on income, though enhanced premium tax credits face uncertainty.

**Tribal Programs**

Four federally recognized tribes in Maine operate their own health and social service programs. Tribal coordination for exemptions requires development, particularly for Aroostook Band of Micmacs and Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians located in northern Maine.
