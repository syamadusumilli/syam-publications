## Work Requirement History

Rhode Island has no prior history of implementing Medicaid work requirements. The state was among the first to embrace Medicaid expansion in 2014 under the Affordable Care Act, with former Governor Lincoln Chafee moving forward immediately after the Supreme Court ruling made expansion optional. Rhode Island established its own state-run health insurance exchange, HealthSource RI, reflecting early and sustained commitment to coverage expansion.

The state has, however, implemented SNAP work requirements for Able-Bodied Adults Without Dependents (ABAWDs). Beginning March 2025, ABAWDs in 34 cities and towns must demonstrate 80 hours monthly of work, training, or volunteer activities to maintain SNAP benefits beyond three months. Only residents of Central Falls, Charlestown, New Shoreham, Providence, and Woonsocket are exempt from the time limit requirement due to economic conditions. This SNAP infrastructure provides some operational foundation for Medicaid work requirement implementation, including verification processes and exemption documentation systems.

The state's experience with the post-pandemic Medicaid unwinding process offers relevant lessons. Rhode Island completed eligibility redeterminations for over 350,000 enrollees between April 2023 and April 2024, achieving the second-highest automatic renewal rate nationally. Approximately 59% of renewals were completed passively using existing state data, demonstrating strong data infrastructure and cross-program verification capabilities. However, the process also revealed vulnerabilities: approximately 75,000 people (20% of those up for renewal) lost coverage, with many losing eligibility for procedural rather than substantive reasons.

## Current Policy and Waiver Status

**State Posture**

Governor Dan McKee, a Democrat, has positioned Rhode Island firmly in opposition to federal Medicaid work requirements. Following passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, McKee characterized the legislation's impact as devastating, stating that federal fiscal policies represent "a shell game that shifts staggering federal costs onto states that simply can't absorb them."

The McKee administration released detailed impact analyses in October 2025 showing that federal work requirements "severely threaten" Medicaid coverage for over 30,000 Rhode Islanders. The state estimates 24,500 people will be at risk of losing coverage due to work requirement documentation failures, even though many actually meet the 80-hour monthly threshold. An additional 9,000 Rhode Islanders face coverage loss due to new restrictions on immigrants, refugees, and asylum seekers.

**Legislative Environment**

Rhode Island has unified Democratic control, with Democrats holding supermajorities in both chambers. House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and Senate President Valarie J. Lawson have indicated they are carefully evaluating the challenges posed by federal requirements, seeking "a more in-depth look at the magnitude of the issues facing our state." The legislature required state agencies to produce impact reports, demonstrating engagement with implementation planning even while opposing the underlying policy.

**Administrative Preparation**

The Executive Office of Health and Human Services (EOHHS) is the designated Single State Medicaid Agency. Rhode Island Medicaid Director Kristin Sousa has overseen the post-pandemic redetermination process and is now navigating federal work requirement preparation. The state has invested in verification technology, including The Work Number income verification tool from Equifax, expected to identify approximately 5,500 additional enrollees who no longer qualify based on income.

State agencies continue to await critical federal guidance on implementation details. Rhode Island's analysis notes significant uncertainty about which existing state policies might be protected under grandfather provisions.

## Defining Characteristics

**Compact Geography and Dense Service Infrastructure**

Rhode Island's small size creates unique implementation conditions. The entire state is essentially a single metropolitan area, meaning that geographic barriers to employment, education, or verification services are minimal compared to larger states. No resident lives more than 45 minutes from the Providence core, where the highest concentration of healthcare, workforce development, and social services exists.

This density cuts both ways. While it facilitates access to services, it also means that any system failures affect the entire state simultaneously. There is no geographic redundancy; if Providence-based services become overwhelmed, there are no alternative regional hubs to absorb capacity.

**Strong FQHC Infrastructure**

Rhode Island's eight Federally Qualified Health Centers serve over 122,000 patients statewide through more than 30 locations. Providence Community Health Centers alone serves nearly 80,000 patients, approximately one-quarter of the capital city's population. FQHCs have historically played a critical safety net role in Rhode Island, serving populations that private providers do not reach.

The Rhode Island Health Center Association has been active in advocacy around Medicaid funding and work requirement impacts. FQHCs are already strained by primary care provider shortages and increased patient volumes since the pandemic. Community health center leaders have warned that significant Medicaid cuts or coverage losses could force staff reductions or service closures.

**Managed Care Consolidation**

Rhode Island's Medicaid program operates primarily through managed care, with approximately 90% of enrollees receiving coverage through managed care organizations. The state recently awarded a new five-year, $15 billion contract split between Neighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island and UnitedHealthcare of New England. Tufts Health Plan, which had previously held approximately 5% market share, did not receive a new contract.

Neighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island, a nonprofit founded in 1994, serves approximately 220,000 members and holds the largest share of the Medicaid market. The organization also operates the only Medicare-Medicaid integrated plan in the state. This consolidation means work requirement implementation will flow primarily through two MCO partners, simplifying coordination but concentrating risk.

**Hospital System Pressures**

Rhode Island's hospital landscape is dominated by two systems: Brown University Health (formerly Lifespan), the state's largest, and Care New England. Both systems face significant financial pressures, with Medicaid reimbursement rates that have not kept pace with operating costs or neighboring state rates.

Brown University Health operates Rhode Island Hospital (the state's Level I Trauma Center and principal teaching hospital for Brown's Warren Alpert Medical School), The Miriam Hospital, Bradley Hospital (behavioral health), and Newport Hospital. The system employs over 17,000 workers and recently emerged from multi-year operating losses.

Governor McKee's proposed fiscal 2026 budget drew sharp criticism from hospital associations for freezing Medicaid reimbursement rates. The Rhode Island Hospital Association has warned that hospitals "can't afford anything less" than full rate restoration and additional investments. Any work requirement implementation that reduces Medicaid enrollment will further strain hospital finances through increased uncompensated care.

**Language Access Requirements**

Rhode Island's significant multilingual population creates substantial language access requirements for work requirement implementation. With Spanish spoken in approximately 136,000 households, Portuguese in 29,000 households, and Haitian Creole in 9,000 households, any verification system must function effectively across multiple languages.

The state already produces Medicaid enrollment materials in 12 languages. Work requirement communications, reporting portals, and navigator services will require similar multilingual capacity. The concentration of immigrant populations in core cities like Providence, Central Falls, and Pawtucket means that language access failures would disproportionately affect urban areas with the highest Medicaid enrollment.

**Fiscal Constraints**

Rhode Island faces a projected budget deficit of approximately $223 to $300 million. The McKee administration has emphasized cost savings rather than tax increases to close the gap. Medicaid, comprising about one-third of the state budget (approximately $4.9 billion, of which $1.8 billion is state funds), represents the largest potential source of savings.

Medicaid enrollment has declined significantly since the pandemic peak, falling from 373,000 in May 2023 to approximately 294,000 projected for fiscal 2027. This decline has improved the budget outlook, but federal work requirements will layer additional administrative costs onto a constrained fiscal environment.

## Expected Implementation Approach

Rhode Island will implement federal work requirements by December 2026 while seeking to maximize coverage retention. Given the state's political orientation and explicit opposition to the underlying policy, implementation design will likely emphasize minimal barriers to compliance.

**Automated Verification Priority**

The state's strong data infrastructure and high passive renewal rates during unwinding suggest capacity for automated verification systems. Rhode Island can leverage existing cross-program data matching with SNAP, TANF, and state wage records to verify work hours without requiring active member reporting for many enrollees.

**Broad Exemption Interpretation**

Expect Rhode Island to interpret exemption categories as broadly as federal regulations permit. The state's concern that 24,500 people may lose coverage due to documentation failures, rather than failure to meet work requirements, signals intent to minimize procedural barriers. Presumptive exemptions based on geographic, demographic, or program participation data could reduce individual documentation burden.

**SNAP Coordination**

Rhode Island's existing SNAP ABAWD work requirement infrastructure provides a foundation for Medicaid implementation. Deemed compliance for individuals already meeting SNAP work requirements could significantly reduce verification burden for overlapping populations. The Department of Human Services administers both SNAP and Medicaid eligibility, facilitating cross-program coordination.

**Navigator Investment**

The state will likely invest in navigator capacity to support enrollees who cannot be verified automatically. HealthSource RI and community health centers already provide enrollment assistance; expanding this infrastructure to include work requirement compliance support would leverage existing trusted relationships.

**MCO Partnership**

With 90% of Medicaid members in managed care and only two MCO partners after July 2025, Rhode Island can coordinate implementation closely with Neighborhood Health Plan and UnitedHealthcare. Both MCOs have financial interest in member retention and can contribute outreach, reminder, and verification support capacity.

## Cross-Program Context

**SNAP Employment & Training**

Rhode Island operates SNAP Employment & Training through community partners and state agencies. The infrastructure for connecting SNAP recipients to work, training, and volunteer opportunities exists and could extend to Medicaid populations. However, capacity to serve an additional 24,000 to 30,000 people requiring activity documentation is uncertain.

**Provider Tax Structure**

Rhode Island uses provider assessments (hospital, nursing facility) for Medicaid financing, creating provider stake in coverage maintenance. Hospital associations have been active advocates for Medicaid funding and could become allies in supporting compliance assistance infrastructure.

**Marketplace Coordination**

HealthSource RI operates robust marketplace infrastructure. Expansion adults losing Medicaid coverage for work requirement noncompliance who earn above 100% FPL would qualify for marketplace coverage with subsidies. The state demonstrated capacity to transition members during unwinding, with 25% of terminated Medicaid enrollees obtaining HealthSource RI coverage. However, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act's elimination of enhanced premium tax credits would significantly increase costs for transitioning members, potentially driving coverage losses rather than transitions.

**Healthcare System Instability**

Rhode Island's primary care system faces acute pressures. Anchor Medical Centers announced closure in 2025, leaving 25,000 Rhode Islanders without primary care providers. Governor McKee has convened a Health Care System Planning Cabinet to address workforce shortages and access challenges. Work requirements implementation occurs against this backdrop of healthcare system fragility.

## Summary: What Rhode Island Is Expected to Do

Rhode Island will implement federal work requirements as mandated while designing systems intended to minimize coverage losses. The state will prioritize automated verification using existing data infrastructure, broad exemption interpretation, and investment in navigator support for populations requiring active compliance assistance.

The state's compact geography, strong managed care infrastructure, and existing SNAP work requirement experience provide operational advantages. However, fiscal constraints limit capacity for new administrative investments, and the healthcare system faces concurrent challenges from primary care shortages and hospital funding pressures.

Rhode Island's multilingual population requires significant language access investment for any verification system to function equitably. The concentration of immigrant populations in core cities means that both work requirements and new restrictions on immigrant eligibility will disproportionately affect urban areas where Medicaid enrollment is highest.

The political environment ensures that implementation will emphasize coverage retention rather than enforcement rigor. Whether state-level design choices can prevent the documentation-driven coverage losses that Governor McKee has warned about remains the central implementation question.
