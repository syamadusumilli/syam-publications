## Work Requirement History

South Dakota has no prior work requirement implementation experience for Medicaid populations. However, the state has a relevant history with the concept.

**2018 Pilot Proposal**

Before Medicaid expansion, Governor Dennis Daugaard's administration sought federal approval for a pilot work requirement program targeting low-income parents in traditional Medicaid. The proposal, announced in the January 2018 State of the State address and formally submitted in May 2018, would have applied to just two counties initially. The Biden administration never approved the waiver, and it remained pending through administration changes.

**2022 Expansion Ballot Measure**

South Dakota voters approved Constitutional Amendment D in November 2022 by a 56-44 margin, requiring the state to expand Medicaid to adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level. The measure was placed on the ballot through a citizen initiative campaign, bypassing a legislature and governor who had repeatedly rejected expansion. Coverage began July 1, 2023, making South Dakota the 39th state to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.

**2024 Work Requirement Ballot Measure**

The Republican-controlled legislature responded to voter-approved expansion by placing Constitutional Amendment F on the November 2024 ballot. The amendment, which passed 56-44, authorized the legislature to establish work requirements for the expansion population, contingent on federal approval. Senate Joint Resolution 501 passed the Senate 28-4 and the House 63-7, with votes falling along party lines.

The ballot question generated significant debate. Proponents argued that work requirements represent "a reasonable modification" to expansion and reflect South Dakota values of self-sufficiency. Opponents, including healthcare organizations and patient advocates, characterized work requirements as bureaucratic barriers that would reduce coverage without increasing employment.

**SDCareerLink Proposal (2025)**

Following Amendment F's passage, the Department of Social Services developed the SDCareerLink waiver application, released for public comment in May 2025. The proposal represented a deliberately modest approach:

Rather than requiring specific monthly hours, SDCareerLink would have required expansion enrollees to work, train, attend school, or serve as caregivers unless they qualified for exemptions. Verification would occur annually at renewal time through self-attestation with documentation, not monthly reporting. The department estimated 80% of expansion enrollees already met requirements or qualified for exemptions.

The department projected a 5-10% enrollment reduction in the first year, saving $48.9-71 million. However, the proposal explicitly acknowledged budget constraints, noting that work requirements "really having to be done within an existing budget" limited administrative complexity.

**Federal Preemption (July 2025)**

The passage of federal Medicaid work requirements through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in early July 2025 rendered South Dakota's waiver application moot. Secretary Matt Althoff characterized the state's proposal as potentially "an exercise in futility" once federal requirements became clear. The state formally withdrew its waiver application following President Trump's signature.

## Current Policy and Waiver Status

South Dakota now operates under the federal work requirement mandate established by the OB3, which takes effect December 2026. The state's independent waiver proposal is withdrawn. Key implications:

**Federal vs. State Design Differences**

The federal requirements are stricter than South Dakota's proposed approach:

- Federal mandate: 80 hours monthly of qualifying activities
- South Dakota proposal: No specific hourly threshold; qualitative participation
- Federal mandate: Verification at application and semi-annual redetermination
- South Dakota proposal: Annual verification at renewal only
- Federal mandate: Compliance required before enrollment begins
- South Dakota proposal: Verification only at renewal, not upfront

South Dakota Medicaid Director Heather Petermann noted the state's proposal was intended to "encourage" work without "trying to track arbitrary work hours." The federal approach requires precisely the hour-tracking the state sought to avoid.

**Administrative Burden**

State officials have expressed concern about implementation costs. Althoff noted that the federal proposal "will cost more administratively than South Dakota's proposed work requirements" and that states "will be asked to absorb" those costs. Given South Dakota's tight budget approved in the 2025 legislative session, building federal-compliant verification infrastructure will require either new appropriations or significant reprogramming.

## Defining Characteristics

South Dakota presents a distinctive implementation challenge shaped by several factors.

**Scale and Personalization**

With approximately 30,500 expansion enrollees, South Dakota operates one of the smallest expansion populations among states facing work requirements. This scale theoretically permits more personalized, relationship-based implementation than larger states can achieve. The Department of Social Services knows its population in ways that California or Ohio cannot.

However, small scale also means limited administrative capacity. The state eliminated 27 positions due to slower-than-expected expansion enrollment growth. Building work requirement infrastructure with reduced staff presents operational challenges.

**Tribal Population Significance**

Approximately 9% of South Dakota's population is Native American, with disproportionate representation among Medicaid expansion enrollees. Tribal members eligible for Indian Health Service qualify for automatic federal exemption from work requirements under OB3. This exemption significantly reduces the population subject to verification requirements.

However, IHS eligibility and tribal enrollment are not synonymous with receiving adequate healthcare. Many Native Americans on reservations face extreme healthcare access barriers regardless of formal exemptions. The closest IHS facility may be hours away on unpaved roads. Exemption from work requirements does not address underlying healthcare infrastructure deficits.

**Geographic Isolation**

South Dakota's rural character creates verification challenges distinct from more urban states. Expansion enrollees in places like Todd County (Rosebud Reservation) or Shannon County (Pine Ridge) face limited internet connectivity, no local DSS offices, and distances measured in hours rather than miles.

The state operates SNAP, TANF, and Medicaid through the same Department of Social Services, creating theoretical coordination opportunities. However, rural service delivery remains challenging across all programs.

**Economic Paradox**

South Dakota presents a paradox for work requirement rationale. The state maintains the nation's lowest unemployment rate (1.8-1.9%), meaning jobs are abundant and employers actively recruiting. The tight labor market suggests that Medicaid expansion enrollees who can work are likely already working or have strong incentives to do so.

If 80% of expansion enrollees already meet work requirements or qualify for exemptions (the state's own estimate), work requirements function primarily as administrative verification rather than behavioral change mechanisms. The policy imposes compliance burden on a population largely already complying.

**Conservative Political Environment**

Governor Kristi Noem's administration has supported work requirements as consistent with South Dakota values. Lieutenant Governor Tony Venhuizen, a prime sponsor of the Amendment F ballot measure, stated: "We believe in the value of work, and that our social programs should be a hand up in tough times, not a way of life."

The state's Republican legislative supermajority (60+ seats in the 70-seat House; 31+ in the 35-seat Senate) ensures no legislative opposition to work requirement implementation. Whatever approach the state takes will face no state-level political obstacles.

## Expected Policy Posture and Timeline

**Implementation Philosophy: Pragmatic Minimalism**

South Dakota is expected to implement work requirements with minimal administrative complexity, driven by budget constraints rather than ideological preference. The withdrawn SDCareerLink proposal signals the state's preferred approach: annual verification through self-attestation, broad exemptions, and minimal ongoing monitoring.

Whether federal regulations permit such simplified implementation remains uncertain. If CMS requires monthly hour-tracking and verification, South Dakota will need to build infrastructure the state explicitly sought to avoid.

**Tribal Coordination**

Effective implementation requires coordination with nine tribal governments. The federal IHS exemption creates a clear legal framework, but operationalizing exemptions requires tribal-state information sharing. States cannot verify IHS eligibility without tribal cooperation.

South Dakota's relationships with tribal governments have been strained under Governor Noem's administration. Whether implementation negotiations improve or worsen those relationships will affect outcomes for the state's significant Native American expansion population.

**Timeline**

- November 2024: Amendment F approved by voters
- May-June 2025: SDCareerLink public comment period
- July 2025: Federal work requirements enacted; state waiver withdrawn
- 2025-2026: Federal regulatory guidance development
- December 2026: Federal work requirement implementation deadline
- January 2027: Work requirements effective for expansion adults

## Summary: What South Dakota Is Expected to Do

South Dakota will implement federal work requirements by December 2026 with the least administrative burden the federal framework permits. The state's small population, tight budget, and withdrawn waiver proposal all point toward a minimalist verification approach.

The critical question is whether federal regulations allow the annual, self-attestation-based verification South Dakota prefers, or require the monthly hour-tracking the state sought to avoid. If CMS permits state flexibility, South Dakota will likely adopt something resembling its original SDCareerLink proposal under federal authority. If CMS mandates stricter verification, the state faces building infrastructure it neither budgeted nor planned for.

Tribal populations represent the largest implementation variable. With automatic federal exemptions for IHS-eligible individuals and South Dakota's significant Native American population, effective tribal coordination determines how many expansion enrollees actually face verification requirements. Poor coordination means more people subject to requirements who should be exempt; good coordination streamlines implementation for the remaining population.

South Dakota's experience will demonstrate whether small-state personalization can overcome small-state capacity constraints. The same DSS staff who eliminated 27 positions for lack of enrollment must now build and operate federal work requirement compliance systems. Whether relationship-based navigation can substitute for automated verification technology becomes a practical test of implementation philosophy.

The state's extremely low unemployment rate suggests that behavioral effects from work requirements will be minimal. People who can work in South Dakota are already working in a labor market desperate for employees. Work requirements will function primarily as documentation requirements for an already-employed population and an exemption-processing system for those who qualify. The policy's effects will be measured in administrative compliance rates, not employment changes.

## Cross-Program Context

**SNAP Coordination**

South Dakota operates SNAP and Medicaid through the same Department of Social Services, creating alignment opportunities. The SDCareerLink proposal explicitly included SNAP work requirement compliance as a qualifying activity for Medicaid purposes. Whether federal Medicaid regulations permit such deemed compliance remains to be determined.

SNAP Able-Bodied Adults Without Dependents (ABAWD) requirements apply to similar populations and use similar verification approaches. Cross-program data sharing could reduce duplicate documentation burden, though different federal agencies (USDA for SNAP, CMS for Medicaid) create coordination complexity.

**TANF Work Requirements**

TANF serves a different population (families with children receiving cash assistance) but uses similar work verification infrastructure. The state has experience administering work requirements, though at smaller scale than Medicaid expansion will require.

**Provider Tax Situation**

South Dakota has minimal dependence on provider taxes for Medicaid financing, limiting hospital system leverage over state Medicaid policy. Rural hospitals face financial pressure regardless of work requirement implementation; coverage losses from work requirements would increase uncompensated care in already-stressed facilities.

**Marketplace Infrastructure**

South Dakota uses the federal HealthCare.gov platform for individual market enrollment. Expansion adults who lose Medicaid coverage for work requirement noncompliance may qualify for marketplace coverage with subsidies, depending on income levels and whether enhanced ACA subsidies are maintained. The marketplace provides a coverage pathway for people between 100-138% FPL who fail work requirements but remain above the coverage gap.
