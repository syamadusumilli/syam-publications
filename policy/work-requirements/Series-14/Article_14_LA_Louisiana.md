**Series 14: State Implementation of Work Requirements**

**Word Count Target:** 2,500-3,000 words

## State Profile

**Demographics**

Louisiana represents a unique case in the work requirements landscape: a Deep South state that expanded Medicaid in 2016 under Democratic Governor John Bel Edwards, now governed by Republican Jeff Landry, who has publicly embraced work requirements as policy philosophy. The state's expansion population faces some of the highest projected coverage losses nationally.

- Expansion adult population: approximately 785,000 (as of May 2025)
- Total Medicaid enrollment: approximately 1.86 million (roughly one-third of state population)
- Percentage of state population on Medicaid: 32.8%, among the highest rates nationally
- Among expansion adults, approximately 46% work full-time, 23% work part-time, and 31% are not working
- The state received approximately $16 billion in federal Medicaid funding in the current fiscal year, representing 75% of the $21.2 billion Medicaid budget
- Racial composition of Medicaid enrollees reflects Louisiana's demographics: significant Black enrollment (approximately 40%), white (approximately 50%), Hispanic and other (approximately 10%)
- Geographic distribution: 20% of Medicaid enrollees live in rural areas, 80% in urban and suburban areas
- Approximately 18% of enrollees have three or more chronic conditions

**Geographic Characteristics**

Louisiana's 64 parishes create substantial implementation variation across dramatically different regions. The state divides naturally into distinct zones that will experience work requirements differently.

The New Orleans metropolitan area (Orleans, Jefferson, St. Bernard, Plaquemines parishes) contains the highest concentration of expansion adults. Orleans Parish historically faced catastrophic healthcare disruption following Hurricane Katrina in 2005, with safety-net hospital closures that reshaped the entire healthcare delivery system. The region has rebuilt around community health centers and managed care but remains vulnerable to coverage disruption.

Baton Rouge and surrounding parishes (East Baton Rouge, Ascension, Livingston, Iberville) represent the state capital region with concentrated state employment, healthcare systems, and universities. Implementation coordination will be easier in this region.

The Mississippi River Delta region, including northeast Louisiana parishes like East Carroll, Madison, Tensas, and Concordia, contains some of the poorest counties in the nation. East Carroll Parish had approximately 64% of residents enrolled in Medicaid as of 2023, up from 53% before expansion. Poverty rates in these parishes approach three times the national average. Lake Providence, the East Carroll Parish seat, was once a thriving agricultural hub; today it exemplifies the economic devastation facing the Delta.

Southwest Louisiana (Calcasieu, Beauregard, Allen parishes) includes the Lake Charles industrial corridor with petrochemical and refinery employment. Hurricane damage from Laura (2020) and Delta (2020) created ongoing recovery challenges.

The Acadiana region (Lafayette, St. Landry, Evangeline, Vermilion parishes) has distinct Cajun cultural characteristics and relies on oil and gas, healthcare, and service industries.

Northern Louisiana (Caddo, Bossier, Ouachita, Lincoln parishes) includes Shreveport-Bossier City and Monroe, with healthcare systems, casinos, and retail as major employers.

**Special Population Concentrations**

Louisiana has limited tribal presence compared to western states. No federally recognized tribes with reservation land create the exemption pathway available in states like Arizona or South Dakota. The Chitimacha, Coushatta, Jena Band of Choctaw, and Tunica-Biloxi tribes have federal recognition but small populations.

The agricultural workforce, particularly in sugar cane regions of south-central Louisiana and the Delta cotton and soybean areas, includes seasonal workers whose hours fluctuate with harvest cycles.

The offshore oil and gas industry creates employment patterns that complicate verification. Workers may work intensive schedules (14 days on, 14 days off) that exceed monthly hour requirements but create documentation challenges.

Louisiana's seafood industry employs workers in fishing, shrimping, and processing with irregular seasonal patterns and informal employment arrangements common in the industry.

Justice-involved populations are significant. Louisiana historically had among the highest incarceration rates nationally. Recent criminal justice reforms have reduced prison populations but increased reentry population size. Justice-involved individuals face employment barriers while navigating work requirements.

Substance use disorder prevalence is significant. Opioid prescribing rates have been among the highest nationally, and the state experienced substantial overdose mortality. Medicaid expansion dramatically increased access to medication-assisted treatment. Coverage losses could disrupt treatment continuity for vulnerable populations.

**Economic Context**

Louisiana's economy has faced structural challenges for decades. Oil and gas price volatility creates boom-and-bust cycles affecting state revenue and employment. The state's overall poverty rate (approximately 18-19%) is among the highest nationally.

- State unemployment rate: approximately 4.5-5.0% (varies significantly by parish)
- Major industries: oil and gas, petrochemicals, healthcare, tourism and hospitality, logistics, agriculture
- New Orleans tourism and hospitality provides substantial low-wage employment
- Gig economy presence in New Orleans and Baton Rouge
- State minimum wage follows federal floor ($7.25)
- Significant informal economy, particularly in coastal fishing communities, construction, and service industries

## Work Requirement History

Louisiana has prior experience considering work requirements but never implemented them. In early 2018, Governor Edwards indicated his administration was "actively working" on ideas for implementing a "reasonable" work requirement, contemplating a waiver application as other states were pursuing under the first Trump administration.

By 2019, Edwards had reversed course, abandoning work requirement pursuit in favor of a pilot program providing voluntary job training to some expansion enrollees. The reversal reflected both the Arkansas implementation failures becoming visible and state analysis suggesting work requirements would cost more to administer than they would save.

When Republican state lawmakers pushed work requirements in 2018, state health officials warned that implementation would require building an entirely new bureaucracy. Louisiana would need additional state workers and new technology systems to track compliance. Legislators also grew concerned that work requirements would create barriers inadvertently kicking people out of Medicaid who should remain eligible, citing Arkansas data showing thousands dropped from coverage due to paperwork failures rather than actual work requirement non-compliance.

The 2018-2019 consideration period means Louisiana has some institutional memory of work requirement policy analysis, but the state built no infrastructure and made no system investments. Unlike Georgia, which spent $100 million on systems that failed, Louisiana spent nothing and starts from scratch.

## Current Policy and Waiver Status

**Federal Mandate Acceptance**

With the One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed into law in July 2025, work requirements became mandatory for expansion adults by January 2027. Louisiana Department of Health has indicated it will spend 18 months preparing for implementation. LDH spokesperson Sarah Herrock framed the state's approach in terms that echo conservative policy philosophy: "We view the work requirements provisions as a means to grow our economy, while reinforcing the value of work and self-sufficiency. This also allows the program to preserve coverage for the most vulnerable populations while eliminating waste, reducing improper payments and combating fraudulent activity."

This framing aligns with Governor Landry's statements since his 2023 campaign, when he indicated interest in work requirements and copayments for Medicaid. Unlike his predecessor who viewed work requirements skeptically, Landry approaches them as philosophically sound policy.

**SNAP Work Requirement Precedent**

Louisiana provides important precedent through Governor Landry's approach to SNAP work requirements. In May 2024, Landry signed Senate Bill 195 prohibiting the Department of Children and Family Services from seeking, applying for, accepting, or renewing any waivers of federal SNAP work requirements. The bill passed along party lines.

This legislation eliminated work requirement waivers that had protected 33 Louisiana parishes with high unemployment from SNAP time limits. Starting October 2024, all SNAP recipients classified as Able-Bodied Adults Without Dependents face work requirements statewide, with no parish-level exemptions despite economic conditions.

The SNAP approach suggests Landry's administration will pursue strict work requirement implementation for Medicaid as well. The philosophy appears to favor universal application over geographic exemptions, even when local employment conditions might justify flexibility.

**MCO Landscape**

Louisiana operates its Medicaid expansion through six managed care organizations under the Healthy Louisiana program: Aetna Better Health of Louisiana, AmeriHealth Caritas Louisiana, Healthy Blue, Humana Healthy Horizons in Louisiana, Louisiana Healthcare Connections (a Centene subsidiary), and UnitedHealthcare Community Plan. MCO contracts are being extended through December 2026, covering the implementation period.

The state recently approved the most expensive government contracts in Louisiana history for these MCOs. Secretary Bruce Greenstein has indicated the Landry administration intends to raise standards for MCOs, expecting more accountability for outcomes. How work requirement responsibilities will be allocated between the state Medicaid agency and MCOs remains undetermined.

## Defining Characteristics

**Disproportionate Impact Projections**

Louisiana faces among the highest projected coverage losses from work requirements nationally. The Urban Institute analysis released in April 2025 estimated roughly 116,000 to 132,000 Louisianans could lose Medicaid coverage due to work requirements. Princeton University researchers estimate 317,000 low-income Louisianans could lose health coverage because of the law. Even the more conservative estimates represent coverage losses exceeding 15% of the expansion population.

The state's high Medicaid enrollment rate (approximately one-third of the population) means absolute numbers affected are substantial despite Louisiana being only the 25th most populous state. KFF projections suggest Louisiana could lose up to $34 billion in federal Medicaid dollars over the next decade from OB3's combined provisions.

**Delta Region Vulnerability**

The Mississippi River Delta parishes represent ground zero for work requirement implementation challenges. East Carroll Parish has 64% of residents on Medicaid; neighboring Madison, Tensas, and Concordia parishes have similar concentrations. These parishes previously qualified for SNAP work requirement waivers due to high unemployment and insufficient job opportunities.

The Delta region faces the fundamental paradox of work requirements: mandating employment in communities without jobs. When the requirement is work and the context is joblessness, the policy cannot achieve its stated aims. Healthcare providers and community advocates in places like Lake Providence describe a population that works when work is available but faces structural unemployment beyond individual control.

Rosie Brown, executive director at East Carroll Community Action Agency, describes Medicaid expansion as "a lifeline" for Lake Providence residents who struggle to make ends meet. Work requirements threaten to snatch away coverage that has reduced the uninsured rate in these parishes from over 22% before expansion to under 10%.

**Community Health Worker Infrastructure**

Louisiana has developed meaningful community health worker infrastructure that could support work requirement navigation. The Louisiana Community Health Outreach Network (LACHON), established in 2010 by New Orleans-based CHWs following Hurricane Katrina, provides professional development, peer support, and advocacy for the CHW workforce.

The Louisiana CHW Workforce Coalition has developed standardized training criteria and a review process for CHW training programs. The Louisiana CHW Institute at LSU Health provides training and technical assistance. The Louisiana Department of Health's Community HealthWays Program employs CHWs across the state's nine public health regions.

Louisiana Medicaid reimburses for CHW services under its state plan as a professional service billed "incident to" supervising physicians, advanced practice nurses, or physician assistants. Federally qualified health centers can bill for CHW services using specific HCPCS codes.

This infrastructure provides foundation for navigation support, though current CHW capacity falls far short of what work requirement implementation will demand. Scaling from existing CHW programs to navigation services for hundreds of thousands of expansion adults requires substantial investment.

**Religious and Community Organization Presence**

Louisiana's strong religious community, particularly Catholic presence in south Louisiana and Baptist presence in north Louisiana, creates potential for faith-based navigation partnerships. Representative Troy Carter has emphasized partnering with nonprofits and religious organizations to help residents stay enrolled, pointing to pop-up curbside events helping residents complete paperwork.

Organizations like CrescentCare in New Orleans provide community-based healthcare and could support navigation services. The Louisiana Primary Care Association coordinates federally qualified health centers that serve as enrollment portals for low-income populations.

## Expected Policy Posture and Timeline

**Anticipated Approach: Enforcement-Oriented**

Louisiana's expected approach tilts toward enforcement rather than zero-friction design. Several factors suggest this trajectory:

Governor Landry's SNAP approach demonstrates willingness to eliminate waivers and exemptions that might soften work requirement impact. The prohibition on seeking SNAP waivers even for parishes with high unemployment signals philosophical commitment to universal work requirements.

The administration's framing of work requirements as "reinforcing the value of work and self-sufficiency" and combating "fraudulent activity" suggests viewing non-compliance as moral failure rather than administrative barrier. This framing tends toward enforcement rather than navigation support.

However, the state lacks the infrastructure for aggressive enforcement. Monthly reporting systems do not exist. Verification technology has not been built. The 18-month timeline to December 2026 creates pressure that may force simplified approaches regardless of philosophical preferences.

The state's experience with SNAP work requirements will provide lessons, though the Medicaid population scale is dramatically larger than SNAP ABAWDs.

**Timeline**

- July 2025: OB3 enacted, federal work requirements mandatory
- Late 2025: CMS guidance expected
- 2026: System development, rulemaking, stakeholder engagement
- December 2026: Work requirements take effect

The timeline is aggressive. Building verification systems, developing exemption processes, establishing communication strategies, and training county and MCO staff in 18 months represents substantial challenge for a state with no prior work requirement infrastructure.

## Summary: What Louisiana Is Expected to Do

Louisiana will implement federal work requirements for its 785,000 expansion adults under an administration philosophically aligned with work-conditioned benefits. The state's enforcement orientation, demonstrated through SNAP work requirement policy, suggests implementation prioritizing compliance verification over navigation support.

Coverage loss projections ranging from 116,000 to 317,000 Louisianans represent among the highest impact estimates nationally. The Mississippi River Delta region, with Medicaid enrollment rates exceeding 60% in some parishes and structural unemployment, will test whether work requirements can function in communities without adequate employment opportunity.

Louisiana's community health worker infrastructure provides foundation for navigation support, but current capacity cannot scale to population need without substantial investment. Whether the state invests in navigation or relies on MCOs to build compliance infrastructure will shape coverage outcomes.

The state's experience with SNAP work requirements provides implementation lessons, though Medicaid's larger population and more complex exemption categories create different challenges. Unlike Georgia, which pivoted from enforcement to zero-friction after experiencing failure, Louisiana enters implementation with enforcement orientation but without infrastructure to execute aggressive verification.

Rural Louisiana, particularly the Delta region and other impoverished parishes, will bear disproportionate impact. Seasonal and informal employment patterns in agriculture, fishing, and offshore oil create verification challenges the state has not yet addressed.

Louisiana offers the clearest test case for work requirement implementation in a Deep South expansion state with conservative leadership philosophically committed to work requirements. Whether the state can maintain coverage while meeting federal requirements, or whether implementation creates coverage losses concentrated among the poorest populations, will depend on infrastructure investments and policy design choices not yet announced.

## Cross-Program Context

**SNAP Work Requirement Alignment**

Louisiana's SNAP and Medicaid programs operate through different departments (DCFS for SNAP, LDH for Medicaid). No automatic deemed compliance currently exists between programs. The 80-hour monthly requirement for SNAP ABAWDs matches the Medicaid requirement, creating theoretical alignment opportunity.

However, SNAP serves a different population than Medicaid expansion. Many Medicaid expansion adults do not receive SNAP. Building cross-program verification would require data sharing between agencies that does not currently exist at the needed scale.

The state's SNAP Employment and Training program (SET for Success) could theoretically serve Medicaid enrollees, but capacity constraints limit scalability.

**Provider Tax Dynamics**

Louisiana relies on hospital assessments to fund the state share of Medicaid. Of the state's $21.2 billion Medicaid budget, approximately 75% comes from federal matching funds. OB3's provider tax caps could affect Louisiana's financing model if current assessment rates exceed new limits.

Hospital support for Medicaid expansion remains strong. The Louisiana Hospital Association and rural hospitals depend on Medicaid revenue. Coverage losses from work requirements would increase uncompensated care, creating financial pressure on hospitals already operating on thin margins.

**Marketplace Infrastructure**

Louisiana operates on the federally facilitated marketplace. Expansion adults losing Medicaid may qualify for marketplace coverage with premium tax credits, though the December 2025 expiration of enhanced ACA subsidies creates uncertainty about affordability.

The state's marketplace enrollment has been modest compared to expansion enrollment, suggesting many low-income Louisianans have limited experience with marketplace navigation. Smooth transitions from Medicaid to marketplace coverage cannot be assumed.
