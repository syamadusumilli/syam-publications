## Work Requirement History

New Jersey has never implemented Medicaid work requirements. The state expanded Medicaid under the ACA effective January 1, 2014, under Governor Chris Christie, making it one of the first Republican-led states to adopt expansion. Governor Phil Murphy, who succeeded Christie in 2018, expanded coverage further through Cover All Kids (eliminating immigration status requirements for children's coverage) and extending postpartum Medicaid to 12 months.

The state's approach to public assistance does include work requirements through Work First New Jersey (WFNJ), the state's TANF program, which requires participation in employment-related activities. However, New Jersey has never sought to extend work conditioning to healthcare coverage, viewing Medicaid as fundamentally different from cash assistance.

New Jersey's political environment has been firmly opposed to Medicaid work requirements. When other states pursued Section 1115 waivers for work requirements in 2018-2019, New Jersey actively opposed the concept. Governor Murphy's administration has been vocal about the potential damage OB3 provisions could inflict on the state's healthcare infrastructure.

## Current Policy and Waiver Status

**Federal Requirements Coming**

Under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, New Jersey must implement work requirements for expansion adults by December 2026. The state has not submitted a Section 1115 waiver amendment and shows no indication of pursuing early implementation.

The New Jersey Department of Human Services, led by Commissioner Sarah Adelman, has publicly warned of severe consequences. State estimates project that up to 300,000 eligible residents may lose or fail to obtain NJ FamilyCare coverage due to bureaucratic barriers, with approximately 50,000 adults losing coverage specifically because they cannot document compliance with work requirements. The state also estimates 15,000 to 25,000 immigrants will lose coverage under OB3's immigration eligibility restrictions.

**State Legislative Position**

New Jersey's Democratic-controlled legislature shares the administration's opposition. No state legislation authorizing or implementing work requirements has been introduced. The political environment suggests New Jersey will implement only what federal law absolutely requires, pursuing maximum exemptions and minimal enforcement intensity.

**Financial Exposure**

The state faces significant fiscal impact. New Jersey is one of ten states benefiting from the current federal minimum FMAP floor of 50%. Without this floor, New Jersey's per capita income formula would yield a matching rate of approximately 38%, dramatically increasing the state's share of Medicaid costs. OB3 provisions that may restructure FMAP calculations create additional uncertainty. State modeling projects $3.3 billion in annual cuts to New Jersey hospitals and public health systems, plus $360 million in annual state budget reductions from lost federal funding and provider assessment revenue.

## Defining Characteristics

**County Administration in a Compact State**

Like New York, New Jersey delegates Medicaid eligibility determination to county-level agencies. Twenty-one County Welfare Agencies (variously called Boards of Social Services, Divisions of Social Services, or Departments of Family Services) handle applications, redeterminations, and case management. The Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services (DMAHS) within the Department of Human Services provides state-level oversight and policy direction.

This county structure creates implementation variability. Essex County (Newark) and Hudson County (Jersey City) handle vastly different caseloads than Sussex County or Hunterdon County. Staff capacity, technology infrastructure, and local practices differ across all 21 agencies. A statewide work requirement verification system must operate coherently across this fragmented administration.

However, New Jersey's geographic compactness offers an advantage over states like New York. No county is truly isolated. The entire state is within reasonable commuting distance of major urban centers, and broadband access is relatively strong even in the most rural southern and northwestern counties. The "access desert" problem that plagues rural areas of other states is less acute here, though not absent.

**Five MCOs With Established Infrastructure**

New Jersey contracts with five managed care organizations to serve the NJ FamilyCare population:

- Aetna Better Health of New Jersey
- Fidelis Care (formerly WellCare)
- Horizon NJ Health
- UnitedHealthcare Community Plan
- Wellpoint (formerly Amerigroup)

These MCOs have established member engagement infrastructure from the post-pandemic unwinding period, when New Jersey processed redeterminations for its entire Medicaid population. The unwinding experience, which required outreach, contact information updates, and renewal assistance at scale, provides a foundation for work requirement compliance support. MCOs have already developed workflows for member outreach, and their community health worker and care management teams can be redirected toward work requirement navigation.

Horizon NJ Health, as the state-based plan with deep community roots, occupies a distinctive position. Unlike national MCOs that can spread compliance infrastructure costs across multiple state contracts, Horizon's entire Medicaid operation is concentrated in New Jersey, creating both stronger local relationships and greater per-member exposure to implementation disruption.

**The Opioid Dimension**

New Jersey's opioid crisis adds complexity that many other states share but few experience at the same intensity. The state's overdose death rate has consistently ranked among the highest nationally. Medicaid expansion has been the primary coverage mechanism for substance use disorder treatment, funding medication-assisted treatment, residential programs, and outpatient counseling for hundreds of thousands of enrollees.

Work requirements intersect with substance use disorder treatment in particularly fraught ways. Active treatment participation should qualify as a compliance activity, but individuals in early recovery face executive function impairments, housing instability, and employment barriers that make monthly documentation difficult. The exemption process for people in treatment must be straightforward enough that it does not become a barrier to the treatment itself. States that design verification systems requiring treatment providers to submit additional documentation risk burdening an already stretched behavioral health workforce.

**Suburban Working Poor**

New Jersey's distinctive challenge is its large suburban working poor population. The state's extremely high cost of living means that individuals earning well above national averages still cannot afford commercial health insurance. A warehouse worker earning $18 per hour and working 35 hours per week earns too much for Medicaid in most states but depends on expansion coverage in New Jersey because employer-sponsored insurance, even where offered, carries premiums and deductibles that consume a disproportionate share of income.

Many of these individuals already satisfy the 80-hour monthly requirement through their employment. The challenge is not getting them to work but getting their work documented. Warehouse and logistics employers, temporary staffing agencies, and gig platforms may not have streamlined processes for submitting verification data to state systems. The administrative burden falls on workers who are already employed but must prove it through systems they have never navigated.

This dynamic reinforces the central insight running through the entire Series 14 analysis: the problem is verification failure, not work failure. New Jersey's working Medicaid population, at 71%, already exceeds the work requirement threshold. The coverage losses will come from documentation barriers, not from genuine non-compliance.

## Expected Implementation Approach

New Jersey will almost certainly pursue the least restrictive implementation legally permissible. Expected design elements:

The state will claim all available exemption categories at their broadest interpretation. Medical frailty definitions will be expansive. Caregiver exemptions will extend to maximum allowable ages. Student exemptions will include part-time enrollment. Pregnancy and postpartum exemptions will use the most generous timeframes federal rules allow.

Verification burden will be minimized through emphasis on self-attestation, administrative data matching that automatically identifies exempt populations, and reporting requirements at the minimum federal frequency. The state's existing data infrastructure, including connections to the Department of Labor for wage data, can support automated verification for many traditional employment arrangements.

Navigator and community organization infrastructure will be deployed to help people document exemptions rather than employment. Outreach will emphasize who does not have to comply rather than how to comply.

**Timeline Uncertainty**

New Jersey's delayed waiver submission creates planning challenges for MCOs, providers, and county agencies. If the state submits a waiver in early-to-mid 2026, CMS negotiation and approval could extend through summer 2026, leaving minimal time for system development before the December 2026 deadline. The state may seek the good faith compliance extension available under OB3, which could delay full implementation to December 2028.

## Cross-Program Context

**SNAP Coordination**

New Jersey administers SNAP through the same County Welfare Agencies that handle Medicaid eligibility, creating coordination opportunities. SNAP work requirements (ABAWD) apply to a subset of the Medicaid population, and the shared county infrastructure could theoretically enable deemed compliance between programs. Whether the state pursues this coordination depends on waiver design and federal guidance.

**Work First New Jersey**

The state's TANF program already includes work requirements for cash assistance recipients. WFNJ and Medicaid operate through overlapping county infrastructure, and some Medicaid expansion adults also receive TANF. Cross-program coordination could reduce duplicative documentation for individuals subject to both sets of requirements.

**GetCoveredNJ Marketplace**

New Jersey operates its own state-based marketplace (GetCoveredNJ), providing robust infrastructure for coverage transitions. Individuals losing Medicaid due to work requirement non-compliance could potentially transition to marketplace coverage with subsidies, though the loss of enhanced premium tax credits under OB3 makes marketplace coverage significantly more expensive for many enrollees starting in 2026. Five carriers participate in the 2026 marketplace: Ambetter, AmeriHealth, Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield, Oscar, and UnitedHealthcare.

**Provider Tax Vulnerability**

New Jersey utilizes healthcare provider assessments to finance its Medicaid program. Coverage losses from work requirements would reduce MCO enrollment, potentially lowering provider assessment revenue. OB3 provisions that may restrict state provider tax authority create additional fiscal uncertainty. New Jersey hospitals, particularly safety-net institutions in Camden, Newark, Trenton, and Paterson, depend heavily on Medicaid revenue, and significant enrollment disruption could destabilize facilities already operating on thin margins.

## Summary

New Jersey faces Medicaid work requirements from a position of political opposition, strong existing infrastructure, and genuine fiscal vulnerability. The state's 550,000 expansion adults are overwhelmingly working, suburban, and connected to managed care, which should theoretically make compliance straightforward. In practice, the 21-county administrative structure, the documentation barriers facing gig and warehouse workers, and the opioid treatment population create implementation complexity that cannot be waved away.

The state's approach will mirror New York's in philosophical orientation: maximum exemptions, minimal verification burden, and robust appeals processes designed to prevent coverage loss. But New Jersey's smaller scale, geographic compactness, and established MCO relationships offer advantages that New York's sprawling county system does not. If any blue state can implement work requirements without catastrophic coverage loss, New Jersey's infrastructure gives it a reasonable chance, provided the state begins building compliance systems soon enough to meet whatever timeline federal regulators ultimately enforce.

The critical unknown is timing. New Jersey's strategy of delay may create a compressed implementation window that undermines even the best-designed system. The state's 21 county agencies, five MCOs, and hundreds of community organizations need lead time to build workflows, train staff, and reach members. Every month of delay at the state level becomes a month of compressed preparation at the operational level.
