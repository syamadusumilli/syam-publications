## Work Requirement History

New York has never implemented Medicaid work requirements. The state has historically taken an expansive approach to Medicaid, viewing coverage as an entitlement rather than a conditional benefit. When other states pursued work requirement waivers in 2018-2019, New York explicitly rejected that approach.

The state's Essential Plan, created using Affordable Care Act Basic Health Plan authority, extends coverage beyond standard Medicaid to residents earning up to 250% of the federal poverty level. This represents the most generous state-level coverage expansion in the nation. The Essential Plan currently covers approximately 1.7 million New Yorkers, including many legal immigrants ineligible for Medicaid.

New York's political environment has consistently favored coverage expansion over conditionality. Democratic governors and legislatures have prioritized reducing the uninsured rate, which fell from 10% in 2013 to approximately 5% by 2023, one of the lowest rates nationally.

The state's approach reflects a fundamental philosophy that healthcare access should not depend on employment status. This philosophy will face its most significant test when federal work requirements take effect.

## Current Policy and Waiver Status

**Federal Requirements Coming**

Under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, New York must implement work requirements for expansion adults by January 2027. The state has not submitted a Section 1115 waiver amendment and has shown no indication of pursuing early implementation.

Governor Kathy Hochul's administration has strongly opposed the federal work requirement mandate. In public statements, the administration has warned that OB3 provisions could cause nearly 1.5 million New Yorkers to lose Medicaid or Essential Plan coverage, with the state facing $13.5 billion in annual losses to its healthcare economy. The administration estimates $500 million in new administrative costs to implement and enforce work requirements.

**State Legislative Position**

New York's Democratic-controlled legislature shares the administration's opposition to work requirements. No state legislation authorizing or implementing work requirements has been introduced. The political environment suggests New York will implement only what federal law absolutely requires, seeking maximum exemptions and minimal enforcement.

**Waiver Strategy Uncertainty**

As of late 2025, New York has not publicly released a waiver proposal or implementation timeline. The state appears to be waiting for final federal guidance and potentially seeking to delay implementation as long as legally permissible. This creates significant uncertainty for stakeholders planning around December 2026 deadlines.

The state faces a strategic choice: submit a waiver proposal that attempts to minimize work requirement impact through broad exemptions, or delay as long as possible hoping for policy changes at federal level. Current trajectory suggests the latter approach.

## Defining Characteristics

**County-Administered Complexity**

New York's Medicaid system is unique in its county administration structure. While the state Department of Health sets policy and provides oversight, 57 Local Departments of Social Services (LDSS) outside New York City actually administer the program. NYC's Human Resources Administration handles the five boroughs as a unified system.

This structure creates 58 different implementations for any statewide policy. Each LDSS has different staffing levels, technology infrastructure, and local practices. What works in Manhattan may not function in Hamilton County (population 4,500) in the Adirondacks. A work requirement system must somehow operate coherently across this fragmented administration.

The state has been working to modernize its eligibility system through NY State of Health, moving the MAGI (income-based) Medicaid population to a unified platform. However, approximately 2.4 million enrollees still receive coverage through their LDSS rather than the state marketplace. Transition to modern systems continues through 2026, meaning work requirement implementation would occur during ongoing system transformation.

**Provider Tax Dependence**

New York relies heavily on healthcare provider taxes to finance Medicaid, creating financial structures that work requirement disruptions could destabilize. The Health Care Reform Act (HCRA) taxes fund approximately 80% of the state's Medicaid share. A new managed care organization (MCO) provider tax generates $1.6 billion in the current budget. Hospital and nursing home assessments support supplemental payments and graduate medical education.

Coverage losses from work requirements would reduce MCO enrollment, lowering provider tax revenue. Increased uninsurance would raise uncompensated care costs for hospitals already operating on thin margins. Six rural hospitals are in the top 10% nationally for Medicaid payer mix; five additional rural hospitals have experienced three consecutive years of negative operating margins. Significant coverage disruption could trigger rural hospital closures in communities with no alternative healthcare access.

**NYC Scale and Diversity**

New York City's Medicaid population exceeds the total population of most states. Serving this population requires multilingual capacity across dozens of languages, culturally competent approaches for communities from around the world, and infrastructure that can handle millions of verifications.

The city's Human Resources Administration already processes SNAP, cash assistance, and Medicaid applications for millions of New Yorkers. Adding work requirement verification to this administrative burden would strain an agency that has faced criticism for processing delays and bureaucratic complexity. Advocates have won multiple lawsuits against HRA for failing to process applications within required timeframes.

Work requirements applied to NYC's population would require verification infrastructure at a scale no other locality in America has attempted. The Georgia Pathways program, the only operational work requirement, has enrolled approximately 15,000 people after two years. NYC's expansion population is 100 times larger.

**Essential Plan Parallel Crisis**

The Essential Plan faces simultaneous crisis from OB3 provisions separate from Medicaid work requirements. Federal funding for the Essential Plan is being cut by approximately 50%, threatening $7.5 billion annually. Governor Hochul has requested federal approval to revert to the original Basic Health Plan covering residents up to 200% of the federal poverty level, abandoning the 2024 expansion to 250% FPL. This would cause approximately 450,000 New Yorkers to lose Essential Plan coverage.

The convergence of Essential Plan cuts and Medicaid work requirements creates a dual coverage crisis affecting different but overlapping populations. State resources devoted to managing Essential Plan transitions may limit capacity to implement work requirement systems. The political narrative of federal attacks on New York healthcare may shape how aggressively the state implements work requirements.

The Essential Plan's immigrant population presents additional complexity. Over 725,000 legal immigrants currently receive coverage through the program, many of whom are ineligible for Medicaid due to the five-year waiting period for lawful permanent residents. These populations have substantial Limited English Proficiency, creating additional navigation barriers. If Essential Plan cuts force these residents into the marketplace, premium costs averaging $600-1,000 monthly would render coverage unaffordable for most.

**Rural Upstate Vulnerability**

While NYC dominates New York's Medicaid population, the 24 rural counties face distinct implementation challenges. Approximately 27% of residents in these counties are enrolled in Medicaid. Rural hospitals depend heavily on Medicaid reimbursement, with six rural hospitals in the top 10% nationally for Medicaid payer mix.

Upstate New York faces health professional shortages in every rural county. All 16 rural counties examined in a recent Comptroller's analysis are designated as Health Professional Shortage Areas for primary care, mental health, or dental services. Several counties have no pediatricians or OBGYNs at all. Workforce shortages extend to the eligibility determination staff who would administer work requirements.

Transportation presents a fundamental barrier. Most rural counties have limited public transportation. A resident in Hamilton County or Essex County may live 90 minutes from the nearest workforce development center. Online verification assumes broadband access that remains unreliable in many rural areas despite ongoing expansion efforts.

## Expected Policy Posture and Timeline

**Anticipated Approach: Zero-Friction Within Federal Limits**

New York will almost certainly pursue the least restrictive implementation possible under federal law. Expected design elements:

*Maximum Exemptions:* The state will likely claim all available exemption categories at their broadest interpretation. Medical frailty definitions will be expansive. Caregiver exemptions will extend to the maximum allowable ages. Student exemptions will include part-time enrollment. Any discretionary exemption the federal framework permits will be adopted.

*Minimal Verification Burden:* Expect emphasis on self-attestation over documentation requirements. Administrative data matching where it benefits enrollees (automatically identifying exempt populations). Reporting requirements at minimum federal frequency (six months rather than monthly).

*Navigator Infrastructure:* The state's existing navigator network and community-based organizations would be deployed to help people document exemptions rather than employment. Outreach would emphasize who doesn't have to comply rather than how to comply.

*Appeals and Protections:* Robust appeals infrastructure, long cure periods before coverage termination, and presumptive exemptions pending documentation.

**Timeline Uncertainty**

New York's failure to submit a waiver creates timeline questions. Federal requirements take effect January 2027, but implementation typically requires 12-18 months of system development, stakeholder engagement, and infrastructure building after waiver approval. If New York submits a waiver in early 2026, CMS negotiation and approval could extend to mid-2026, leaving minimal time for implementation.

The state may be calculating that delayed waiver submission creates pressure for federal flexibility on implementation timelines. Alternatively, the state may hope for federal policy changes that reduce or eliminate the mandate before implementation is required.

**Key Decision Points**

- Late 2025 to early 2026: Whether and when to submit Section 1115 waiver amendment
- Spring 2026: CMS negotiation over exemption breadth and verification requirements
- Mid-2026: System development decisions (build vs. adapt existing infrastructure)
- December 2026: Federal deadline; whether New York is ready or requests extension
- 2027: Implementation and inevitable litigation over any coverage losses

## Summary: What New York Is Expected to Do

New York will implement Medicaid work requirements with maximum resistance within legal constraints. The state's political environment, healthcare financing structure, and coverage philosophy all align against aggressive implementation. Expect the broadest possible exemptions, minimal verification requirements, extensive navigator support for exemption documentation, and robust appeals processes designed to prevent coverage loss.

The critical uncertainty is whether New York's fragmented county administration can implement any coherent statewide system. Sixty-two different local agencies, with varying capacity and technology, must somehow execute work requirement verification for over 2 million people. The NYC Human Resources Administration alone faces a verification challenge larger than any state has attempted.

If New York's approach works, it will demonstrate that work requirements can be implemented without massive coverage loss by minimizing their practical impact. If the approach fails, whether through federal rejection of waiver terms, implementation breakdowns across 62 counties, or litigation over resulting coverage losses, it will test whether the federal government can compel implementation in a resistant state.

New York's outcome matters beyond its borders. As the largest expansion population facing work requirements, its success or failure will shape how other states understand what's possible. The Essential Plan crisis simultaneously demonstrates the broader healthcare financing stakes beyond work requirements alone.

## Cross-Program Context

**SNAP Divergence**

New York operates SNAP and Medicaid through different administrative structures with limited coordination. SNAP work requirements (ABAWD) apply to a subset of the population, but deemed compliance between SNAP and Medicaid work requirements is not automatic. A recipient complying with SNAP requirements may need to separately document Medicaid compliance unless the waiver establishes coordination mechanisms.

**TANF Work Requirements**

New York's TANF cash assistance program includes work requirements for a different population (primarily families with children). TANF and Medicaid operate through separate systems. Coordination opportunities exist but are not currently developed.

**Housing Assistance**

New York City Housing Authority and upstate housing authorities do not currently impose work requirements on Section 8 or public housing recipients. If federal housing work requirements are implemented, NYC's large public housing population would face compounding requirements across multiple programs.

**Provider Tax Vulnerability**

New York's heavy dependence on provider taxes (HCRA, MCO tax, hospital assessments) creates financial exposure if coverage losses reduce enrollment. OB3 provisions targeting state provider tax authority create additional uncertainty. Federal restrictions on provider tax arrangements could simultaneously reduce state financing capacity and healthcare system stability.

**Marketplace Infrastructure**

NY State of Health provides robust marketplace infrastructure for coverage transitions. However, individuals losing Medicaid due to work requirement non-compliance face different circumstances than those losing eligibility due to income increases. Whether marketplace subsidies are available, and whether churning between Medicaid and marketplace coverage can be managed, affects post-loss outcomes.
