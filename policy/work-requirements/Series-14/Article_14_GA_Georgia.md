## Work Requirement History

Georgia is the only state in the nation with an operational Medicaid work requirement. The Pathways to Coverage program launched July 1, 2023, after years of development, litigation, and delay. Its trajectory offers the most direct evidence available about how work requirements function in practice.

**Original Design and Approval**

Governor Brian Kemp's administration submitted the Pathways Section 1115 waiver in November 2019 as an alternative to full Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. The waiver proposed partial expansion covering adults up to 100% of the federal poverty level (rather than 138% FPL under full expansion), conditioned on demonstrating 80 hours monthly of work, education, training, or community service.

CMS approved the waiver in October 2020, during the final months of the first Trump administration. The approval included monthly reporting requirements, premium payments for enrollees earning 50-100% FPL, and "Member Reward Accounts" designed to incentivize healthy behaviors.

**Biden Administration Conflict**

The Biden administration sought to rescind approval, arguing that work requirements do not advance Medicaid's objectives of providing health coverage. Georgia sued, and in August 2022 a federal judge sided with the state, allowing implementation to proceed. The Biden administration declined to appeal.

**Implementation Delays and Launch**

Implementation was delayed until July 2023, coinciding with the federally mandated Medicaid unwinding period following the COVID-19 continuous enrollment requirement. This timing proved problematic: state eligibility systems and staff were overwhelmed processing redeterminations for existing enrollees while simultaneously launching a new program with complex verification requirements.

**Technology Investment and Failures**

Georgia invested heavily in eligibility and enrollment technology through the Gateway system. Through mid-2025, approximately $52 million was spent on technology, representing 47% of total program costs. The technology was intended to automate verification of qualifying activities and manage monthly reporting.

The technology largely failed to deliver workable verification systems. The enrollment portal proved difficult to navigate. Automated verification of employment hours did not function as designed. The state never implemented automated audits of monthly reporting, meaning the work verification system that was supposed to ensure compliance was never operationalized.

**Enrollment Process Failures**

Research conducted by the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute and partner organizations documented systematic barriers in the enrollment process:

*Application Abandonment:* Over 110,000 Georgians demonstrated initial interest in applying during year one, but only about half submitted complete applications. The gap between interest and completion reflects the burden of documentation requirements.

*Documentation Demands:* Applicants faced steep "paperwork burden" including completing a lengthy online or paper application, then compiling documents to verify qualifying activities and hours. Pay stubs, employer letters, and time records were required for employment verification. Volunteer hour documentation required organizational confirmation.

*Portal Difficulties:* The Georgia Gateway online portal proved difficult to navigate. Focus groups with potentially eligible Georgians revealed confusion about requirements, difficulty understanding what documentation was needed, and frustration with system functionality.

*Limited Awareness:* Despite $21 million in awareness campaign spending, many potentially eligible Georgians remained unaware of the program. Although website clicks on the "Apply Now" button increased from 5,000 in February 2025 to 45,000 in June 2025, actual application volume remained flat, suggesting marketing generated interest that the application process could not convert to enrollment.

**Enrollment Outcomes**

The results have been far below projections:

- State projected 100,000 enrollees in year one; actual first-year enrollment was 4,231
- State projected 52,509 enrollees by year five; at current rates, achieving this would take 12+ years
- By June 2025, only 13,369 Georgians had ever been enrolled; only 8,077 remained actively enrolled
- By late 2025, enrollment had reached approximately 15,000 ever enrolled
- Only 2-4% of the estimated 175,000 eligible coverage gap residents have obtained coverage
- Retention rates varied significantly by county; Clarke County retained 70% of ever-enrolled, while Bibb County retained only 54%

More than 40% of Georgia counties had fewer than 10 enrollees after a full year of operation. Rural southwest Georgia counties had zero enrollees. The highest enrollment concentrated in metro Atlanta counties with robust healthcare infrastructure and navigation support.

**Cost Structure**

Total program spending through mid-2025 reached approximately $110 million:

- Health care benefits: 31% of total costs
- Eligibility and enrollment technology: 47% of total costs
- Awareness and outreach campaigns: 22% of total costs (including $21 million in ARPA-funded marketing)

Per-enrollee costs reached approximately $13,597 through June 2025, compared to estimated per-enrollee costs of approximately $496 under full Medicaid expansion. The program cost roughly five times more per person than expansion would have.

The state contracted with Deloitte Consulting for technology and outreach services. A Government Accountability Office report found that in the first 15 months, there were only 3,500 person-year equivalents enrolled, and two-thirds of spending went to administrative rather than healthcare costs.

## Current Policy and Waiver Status

**September 2025 Extension**

The Trump administration extended Georgia's Pathways waiver in September 2025 through December 31, 2026. CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz described Pathways as "a very smart path for states who are not expanding Medicaid, and it might be a path for states that have expanded who want to go back."

**Key Policy Changes Effective October 2025**

The extension approval included significant modifications designed to address the program's failures:

*Reporting Frequency Reduced:* Members now report qualifying activities only at initial application and annual renewal, eliminating the monthly reporting requirement that was never fully enforced anyway. This aligns Pathways with other Georgia Medicaid programs.

*Caregiver Exemption Added:* Parents and legal guardians of children under six who are enrolled in Medicaid now qualify through caregiving as a qualifying activity, in addition to employment, volunteering, and education.

*Retroactive Coverage:* Coverage now begins on the first day of the month in which an application is received, addressing gaps that left enrollees uncovered during processing delays.

*Premiums Dropped:* The state removed premium requirements that were never implemented. Member Reward Accounts, which were also never implemented, were eliminated.

**CMS Reporting Requirements Reduced**

Georgia will now report on Pathways performance annually rather than monthly, reducing oversight and transparency. The summative evaluation will be due 18 months after the extension period ends.

**Outstanding Questions**

The extension runs only through December 2026, when federal work requirements under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act take effect. It remains unclear how Pathways will align with the federal mandate. Georgia's 100% FPL eligibility ceiling differs from the 138% FPL expansion population subject to federal requirements in other states.

## Defining Characteristics

**Partial Expansion Structure**

Georgia's fundamental distinction is that it did not accept full Medicaid expansion. Pathways covers adults up to 100% FPL, not 138% FPL. The state receives its regular federal matching rate (approximately 67% federal, 33% state) rather than the enhanced 90% federal match available for expansion populations.

This means Georgia's program serves a smaller, lower-income population than work requirements in expansion states will cover. Someone earning 110% FPL in Georgia has no Medicaid option; in an expansion state, they would be covered without work requirements becoming mandatory until December 2026.

**Only Operational Work Requirement Nationally**

Georgia is the only state currently enforcing work requirements for Medicaid eligibility. Other states' prior attempts (Arkansas, New Hampshire, Michigan, Indiana, Kentucky) were halted by courts or suspended during the pandemic. This makes Georgia the sole source of real-world implementation data.

The comparison with North Carolina is instructive. North Carolina expanded Medicaid in December 2023, accepting federal funding without work requirements. Within comparable time periods:

- North Carolina enrolled 553,890 people
- Georgia enrolled approximately 8,000 people

North Carolina achieved this with lower administrative costs per enrollee, standard enhanced federal matching rates (90% federal), and no litigation expenses. Thirty-seven percent of North Carolina enrollees live in rural counties, demonstrating that rural populations can be reached through conventional expansion.

Georgia's approach cost approximately $13,597 per active enrollee through mid-2025. Full Medicaid expansion would cost an estimated $496 per enrollee, with the federal government covering 90% rather than Georgia's standard 67% match.

**Non-Enforcement of Core Design Elements**

A defining irony of Georgia's program is that most of its distinguishing features were never implemented:

- Monthly work verification was required on paper but automated audits never occurred
- The state did not suspend or terminate coverage based on monthly reporting failures
- Premiums were authorized but never collected
- Member Reward Accounts were never operationalized

The program essentially functioned as a cumbersome enrollment gateway rather than an ongoing compliance system. People who completed the difficult initial enrollment process were not subsequently terminated for failure to report work hours.

**Deloitte Dependence**

Deloitte Consulting received the majority of program expenditures for technology development and outreach campaigns. The GAO report and advocacy analyses raised questions about whether administrative spending met federal requirements for enhanced matching rates. The company's role in both the technology failures and subsequent outreach efforts created ongoing controversy.

**Litigation History**

Georgia has engaged in extensive litigation to maintain its program:

- Successfully sued CMS when the Biden administration sought rescission
- Filed lawsuit seeking waiver extension when CMS initially declined to extend
- Spent substantial (undisclosed) amounts on legal fees defending the program

The state's willingness to litigate demonstrates political commitment to work requirements as policy regardless of enrollment outcomes.

---

## Expected Policy Posture and Timeline

**Current Posture: Passive Compliance**

Georgia's October 2025 changes shift the program toward what might be called "passive compliance" rather than active enforcement:

- Verify work status at enrollment and annual renewal only
- No ongoing monthly verification
- Broader exemptions (caregivers of young children)
- Retroactive coverage reducing gaps

This represents de facto movement toward a "zero-friction" model, though the state would not use that language. The administrative infrastructure for rigorous enforcement never worked, and the state has implicitly accepted that reality.

**Timeline**

Georgia's waiver runs through December 2026, when federal work requirements take effect nationally. The state faces several decisions:

*Alignment with Federal Requirements:* The OB3 work requirement provisions include exemptions and parameters that may differ from Georgia's current design. Georgia will need to align Pathways with federal requirements or seek waivers for deviations.

*Full Expansion Question:* Legislation calling for full Medicaid expansion was introduced in early 2025. Alternative legislation proposed a privatized expansion model similar to Arkansas's approach. Neither has advanced, but the political question remains live.

*Technology Procurement:* The state is re-procuring and replacing the Gateway eligibility system. Whether new technology will enable the verification functions the current system failed to deliver remains uncertain.

*Federal Funding:* Georgia sought but was denied enhanced (90%) federal matching for its partial expansion. The state continues operating with standard matching rates, making the program more expensive per capita than expansion would be.

## Summary: What Georgia Is Expected to Do

Georgia will continue operating Pathways to Coverage with significantly reduced administrative burden following the October 2025 modifications. The elimination of monthly reporting and addition of caregiver exemptions moves the program closer to a conventional eligibility determination rather than an ongoing compliance monitoring system.

The state's trajectory demonstrates an important implementation lesson: Georgia designed a high-friction work verification system, invested over $100 million in technology and administration, and ultimately could not make it function. Rather than acknowledging failure, the state modified the program to remove the elements that weren't working while maintaining the rhetorical commitment to work requirements.

**Lessons for Federal Implementation**

When federal work requirements take effect in December 2026, all expansion states will face the challenges Georgia encountered. Georgia's experience offers several cautionary findings:

Work verification systems are difficult and expensive to operate. Georgia spent 47% of program costs on technology that never delivered promised verification functions. States planning to build verification infrastructure have 14 months to accomplish what Georgia could not in several years.

Monthly reporting requirements create administrative burden without proportionate compliance benefits. Georgia never enforced monthly verification and eventually abandoned it. The federal requirement specifies verification but leaves frequency to states; Georgia's experience suggests monthly verification is neither practical nor necessary.

Enrollment will be far below projections when barriers are high. Two years in, Georgia has enrolled 2-4% of the eligible population, suggesting work requirements function primarily as enrollment barriers rather than coverage pathways. States seeking to maintain coverage will need to minimize barriers.

Administrative costs dominate healthcare costs in high-friction designs. When most spending goes to consultants and technology rather than medical care, the fundamental purpose of a healthcare program is undermined.

The program can survive politically despite poor outcomes. Governor Kemp characterizes Pathways as successful and innovative. The Trump administration extended it with praise. CMS Administrator Oz called it "a very smart path." Performance metrics have not altered political commitments.

**The Open Question**

Georgia's experience does not resolve whether work requirements can succeed; it demonstrates that the version Georgia attempted did not. The state's October 2025 pivot toward reduced reporting suggests implicit recognition that high-friction verification cannot be operationalized at scale.

Whether other states can learn from Georgia's failures and design systems that actually enroll significant populations while maintaining meaningful verification remains the central question for December 2026. Georgia will continue as the primary reference point, though its partial expansion structure (100% FPL) differs from the full expansion population (138% FPL) that other states must serve.

## Cross-Program Context

**SNAP E&T Alignment**

Georgia operates SNAP Employment & Training separately from Pathways. No automatic deemed compliance exists between programs. An enrollee meeting SNAP work requirements must separately document compliance for Pathways. Advocates have called for alignment, including extending SNAP exemptions (veterans, former foster youth, full-time parents) to Pathways.

**TANF Work Requirements**

Georgia's TANF program includes work requirements for a different population (primarily families with children receiving cash assistance). TANF and Pathways operate independently with separate verification systems.

**Provider Tax Situation**

Georgia has minimal dependence on provider taxes for Medicaid financing compared to states like New York or California. This gives the state more fiscal flexibility but also means less pressure from hospital systems to expand coverage.

**Marketplace Infrastructure**

Georgia operates Georgia Access, a state-based health insurance marketplace. Enhanced ACA subsidies (if maintained) provide coverage options for people earning above 100% FPL who don't qualify for Pathways. However, people in the coverage gap below 100% FPL have no marketplace subsidy options, making Pathways their only potential coverage pathway.

**Rural Hospital Crisis**

Twelve Georgia hospitals have closed in the past decade, most in rural communities. The Georgia Hospital Association has supported Pathways as better than nothing but has also called for full expansion to address uncompensated care costs straining remaining facilities.
