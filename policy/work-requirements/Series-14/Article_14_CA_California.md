## Work Requirement History

California has no prior work requirement experience. The state never sought Section 1115 waiver authority to impose work requirements during the 2017-2021 period when CMS was approving such waivers. Governor Gavin Newsom's administration and the Democratic-controlled legislature have consistently opposed conditioning healthcare access on work documentation.

The state's policy history reflects a different philosophy: California expanded Medi-Cal eligibility beyond federal requirements, extending full-scope coverage to undocumented adults regardless of age through state-only funding. This approach positioned California as the national leader in Medicaid access expansion, making the imposition of federal work requirements particularly dissonant with state policy direction.

However, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act explicitly prohibits states from waiving work requirements through Section 1115 authority. California faces a federal mandate it philosophically opposes but cannot legally avoid.

## Current Policy and Waiver Status

**Federal Requirements Taking Effect**

The December 31, 2026 deadline applies to California's approximately 5 million expansion adults. Key federal requirements include:

- 80-hour monthly work, education, training, or community service requirement for ages 19-64
- Mandatory exemptions for parents of children under 13, medically frail individuals, pregnant women, and others specified in OBBBA
- Prospective verification requirement (compliance must be documented before enrollment or renewal)
- Semi-annual redetermination replacing annual renewal (also effective December 2026)
- Data matching requirements where available

**State Response**

The California Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) issued initial guidance in late 2025 acknowledging the federal mandate. The state's approach appears to include:

- Pursuing maximum exemption definitions within federal parameters
- Exploring automated verification through existing data systems
- Integrating work requirement verification with CalAIM infrastructure
- Maintaining member-favorable implementation design

No state legislation has been introduced to exceed federal requirements or impose stricter verification. The expectation is that California will implement the minimum federal requirements with maximum accommodations for affected populations.

**Concurrent State Policy Changes**

California faces its own budget-driven Medi-Cal changes simultaneous with federal work requirements:

- Asset limit reinstatement ($130,000 per person) effective January 2026
- Enrollment freeze for undocumented adults effective January 2026 (existing enrollees grandfathered)
- Dental benefit elimination for undocumented adults effective July 2026
- Monthly premiums ($30/month) for undocumented adults ages 19-59 effective July 2027

These state-imposed changes compound the federal work requirement implementation, creating multiple simultaneous disruptions for Medi-Cal enrollees and administrative systems.

## Defining Characteristics

California's work requirement implementation will be shaped by several distinctive features that differentiate it from all other states.

**Scale Without Parallel**

California's 5 million expansion adults exceed the combined expansion populations of the next three largest states. A 10% coverage loss rate would mean 500,000 Californians losing healthcare. The Urban Institute projects potential coverage losses of 1.2-1.4 million Californians under work requirements, representing 25-30% of the affected population. UC Berkeley Labor Center analysis suggests up to 8 million Medi-Cal enrollees face some risk from the combined federal and state policy changes.

This scale creates operational challenges no other state faces. Systems that work for 300,000 people may fail at 5 million. Error rates that seem acceptable at 2% become catastrophic when applied to populations this large. California cannot learn from other states' experiences because no state operates at comparable scale.

**County-Administered Eligibility**

Unlike most states where Medicaid eligibility is state-administered, California delegates eligibility determination to its 58 county welfare departments. Each county operates its own eligibility systems, staffing structures, and procedural variations within state guidelines.

This structure creates implementation complexity that centralized states avoid. Work requirement verification must function across 58 different administrative contexts. Los Angeles County processes more Medi-Cal applications than most entire states. Rural counties like Alpine, Modoc, or Sierra have eligibility staff in single digits.

Standardizing verification processes, training thousands of county workers, and ensuring consistent exemption determinations across jurisdictions represents an administrative undertaking without precedent. The state's two primary eligibility systems, CalSAWS (replacing the former CalWIN and C4Yourself systems), must be modified to accommodate work requirement verification, but county procedural variation persists regardless of system standardization.

**Managed Care Fragmentation**

California operates six different managed care models across its 58 counties. As of 2024, approximately 24 managed care organizations hold Medi-Cal contracts, with different MCOs operating in different counties and models. Understanding this landscape is essential for work requirement implementation because navigation support, care coordination, and member communication must flow through these varied structures.

**County Organized Health Systems (COHS)**

The COHS model operates in 22 counties through locally-governed health plans that serve as the single Medi-Cal managed care option in their service areas. COHS plans have deep community roots and typically strong relationships with local providers and social service organizations.

Major COHS plans include:
- Partnership HealthPlan of California: Serves 14 northern California counties including Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Lassen, Marin, Mendocino, Modoc, Napa, Shasta, Siskiyou, Solano, Sonoma, Trinity, and Yolo, plus counties transitioning to COHS in 2024 (Butte, Colusa, Glenn, Nevada, Placer, Plumas, Sierra, Sutter, Tehama, Yuba)
- CalOptima Health: Serves Orange County's approximately 900,000 Medi-Cal members
- Central California Alliance for Health: Serves Merced, Monterey, Santa Cruz counties, plus Mariposa and San Benito (2024)
- CenCal Health: Serves San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara counties
- Health Plan of San Mateo: Serves San Mateo County
- Gold Coast Health Plan: Serves Ventura County

COHS plans' single-plan structure simplifies member experience but concentrates implementation responsibility. If a COHS plan's work requirement navigation fails, no alternative exists for members in that county.

**Two-Plan Model**

The Two-Plan model operates in 14 counties, offering members a choice between a locally-operated "Local Initiative" plan and a commercial plan. This model covers the largest share of Medi-Cal managed care enrollment, including Los Angeles County.

Key Two-Plan counties and their MCOs:
- Los Angeles County: L.A. Care Health Plan (Local Initiative, largest Medi-Cal plan nationally with over 2.8 million members) and Health Net Community Solutions (with Molina Healthcare subcontracting 50% of Health Net's members)
- Riverside and San Bernardino (Inland Empire): Inland Empire Health Plan (Local Initiative) and Molina Healthcare of California
- Fresno, Kings, Madera: CalViva Health (Local Initiative) and Anthem Blue Cross Partnership Plan
- San Francisco: San Francisco Health Plan (Local Initiative) and Anthem Blue Cross Partnership Plan
- Santa Clara: Santa Clara Family Health Plan (Local Initiative) and Anthem Blue Cross Partnership Plan
- San Joaquin and Stanislaus: Health Plan of San Joaquin (Local Initiative) and Health Net Community Solutions
- Kern: Kern Family Health Care (Local Initiative) and Anthem Blue Cross Partnership Plan
- Tulare: Anthem Blue Cross Partnership Plan and Health Net Community Solutions

Two-Plan counties require coordination between two MCOs with different operational approaches, corporate cultures, and community relationships.

**Geographic Managed Care (GMC)**

The GMC model operates in Sacramento and San Diego counties, offering members choice among multiple commercial plans competing in the same market.

Sacramento County MCOs:
- Anthem Blue Cross Partnership Plan
- Health Net Community Solutions
- Molina Healthcare of California
- Kaiser Permanente (limited eligibility)

San Diego County MCOs:
- Blue Shield of California Promise Health Plan
- Community Health Group Partnership Plan
- Molina Healthcare of California
- Kaiser Permanente (limited eligibility)

GMC counties' multi-plan competition creates variation in member experience and navigation support quality within the same county.

**Regional Model**

The Regional model historically operated in rural counties with limited managed care infrastructure, offering members choice among statewide commercial plans. Following 2024 restructuring, most Regional counties transitioned to COHS (Partnership HealthPlan) or Two-Plan models.

Remaining Regional counties include Amador, Calaveras, Inyo, Mono, and Tuolumne, served by:
- Anthem Blue Cross Partnership Plan
- Health Net Community Solutions (operating as California Health & Wellness in some counties)
- Kaiser Permanente (limited eligibility)

These rural counties face the greatest infrastructure challenges for work requirement implementation due to limited administrative capacity and geographic isolation.

**Single Plan Model**

Following 2024 restructuring, several counties transitioned to Single Plan models where one MCO serves as the primary option:
- Alameda County: Alameda Alliance for Health
- Contra Costa County: Contra Costa Health Plan
- Imperial County: Community Health Plan of Imperial Valley

Single Plan counties simplify member navigation but concentrate implementation risk.

**Kaiser Permanente's Limited Role**

Kaiser Permanente participates in Medi-Cal managed care across 32 counties but with restricted eligibility. Members qualify for Kaiser only if they had Kaiser membership within the preceding 12 months, have a family member in the same household who is a current Kaiser member, or are dually eligible for Medicare and Medi-Cal. Foster youth have open choice enrollment. This limited eligibility means Kaiser serves a small fraction of Medi-Cal members despite its geographic presence.

**Implications for Work Requirement Implementation**

This fragmented landscape means work requirement navigation must function across:
- 24 different MCO organizations with varying capabilities
- Six different model types with different governance structures
- 58 county eligibility operations interfacing with MCO systems
- Member populations that may change MCOs during coverage disruptions

An expansion adult losing coverage for work requirement noncompliance may reenroll in a different MCO than they previously had, losing continuity with care coordinators who understood their situation. MCOs with strong navigation infrastructure will retain members that MCOs with weak infrastructure lose. The competitive dynamics of Two-Plan and GMC counties create incentives for MCOs to invest in retention, while COHS and Single Plan counties lack competitive pressure.

CalAIM reforms have pushed toward standardization, requiring all MCOs to offer Enhanced Care Management (ECM) and Community Supports. These capabilities provide infrastructure that could support work requirement navigation, but utilization remains below projections. ECM serves only 0.9% of members against estimated eligibility of 3-5%.

**Linguistic Diversity Unmatched Nationally**

California has the largest Limited English Proficiency population in the United States. Among Medi-Cal expansion adults, estimates suggest 900,000 to 1.2 million have limited English proficiency. Major languages include Spanish, Mandarin, Cantonese, Vietnamese, Korean, Tagalog, Russian, Armenian, Farsi, Arabic, and numerous others.

Verification systems designed for English speakers will systematically fail these populations. Translated documents are insufficient when verification processes require phone navigation, online portal usage, or document submission with English-language instructions. Indigenous Mexican populations speaking Mixtec, Zapotec, or Triqui face additional barriers as interpreters for these languages are scarce even in California.

The state's language access infrastructure is more developed than any other, but work requirement verification demands go beyond existing translation services. Understanding that monthly hours must be reported, knowing which activities qualify, navigating exemption processes, and appealing denials all require linguistic accessibility that current systems may not provide at scale.

**Agricultural Economy and Seasonal Employment**

California produces over one-third of the nation's vegetables and nearly two-thirds of its fruits and nuts. This agricultural economy depends on a workforce of 500,000-800,000 farmworkers who face unique work requirement challenges.

Agricultural employment is intensely seasonal. A farmworker may work 50-60 hours weekly during harvest (July-November) and have limited or no agricultural employment during winter months. The 80-hour monthly requirement assumes employment patterns that agriculture does not follow. Workers may easily exceed annual hour thresholds while failing specific monthly requirements during off-seasons.

Verification presents additional challenges. Farm labor contractors, who employ the majority of Central Valley agricultural workers, have variable record-keeping. Piece-rate compensation complicates hour documentation. Multiple short-term employers during a single season create paperwork burden that exceeds other industries.

The estimated 65% undocumented share of the agricultural workforce means many farmworkers are ineligible for federally-funded Medi-Cal regardless of work requirements. But the approximately 35% who are documented face verification challenges specific to agricultural employment patterns.

**Undocumented Population Complexity**

California's decision to extend full-scope Medi-Cal to undocumented adults using state-only funding created a coverage pathway federal work requirements do not reach. Federal work requirements apply only to the federally-funded expansion population, not to individuals enrolled through state-only authority.

However, the practical distinction is more complex than the legal categories suggest. Some individuals may have mixed immigration status within families. Others may have pending applications that affect coverage category. The state's January 2026 enrollment freeze for undocumented adults creates a parallel disruption that will affect the same communities, even if technically through different policy mechanisms.

Medi-Cal eligibility workers must now track federal and state funding streams, work requirement applicability, and immigration status interactions that did not previously affect benefit determinations. This complexity adds processing time and error potential.

**CalAIM Transformation Mid-Stream**

California launched CalAIM (California Advancing and Innovating Medi-Cal) in January 2022, a five-year initiative transforming the Medi-Cal program. Key elements include:

- Enhanced Care Management (ECM) for high-risk populations
- Community Supports (14 services addressing social determinants)
- Closed Loop Referral System (CLRS) requirements effective July 2025
- Mandatory managed care enrollment for nearly all populations
- Payment reform and population health management

Work requirement implementation arrives mid-transformation. ECM and Community Supports provide infrastructure that could support navigation and compliance assistance. Care coordinators already engaged with high-risk members could integrate work requirement support into existing workflows.

But CalAIM implementation has faced challenges. ECM and Community Supports utilization remains at 0.9% of members, far below the 3-5% estimated eligible population. Provider capacity constraints, referral system limitations, and member engagement challenges have slowed uptake. Adding work requirement responsibilities to systems still establishing baseline CalAIM functions risks overwhelming emerging infrastructure.

**Progressive Political Environment Facing Federal Override**

California's Democratic trifecta (governor, Senate, Assembly) has no interest in aggressive work requirement implementation. The state's healthcare policy direction has consistently emphasized access expansion, not conditionality.

But OBBBA eliminates state discretion to waive work requirements. California cannot avoid implementation through Section 1115 waiver flexibility that the law explicitly prohibits. The state can choose how to implement but not whether to implement.

This creates implementation dynamics different from states that ideologically support work requirements. California will likely pursue every available accommodation: maximum exemption definitions, extended good-faith compliance timelines if the Secretary grants them, automation to reduce member reporting burden, and navigation support to prevent procedural disenrollment.

The 2026 gubernatorial election adds uncertainty. Governor Newsom cannot seek reelection due to term limits. The November 2026 election will occur one month before work requirements take effect. Implementation planning occurs under the current administration, but actual enforcement may begin under a different governor with different priorities.

## Expected Policy Posture and Timeline

**Implementation Philosophy**

California is expected to pursue what might be termed "reluctant compliance with maximum mitigation." The state will implement federal requirements because it must, while using every available mechanism to minimize coverage losses.

Expected characteristics include:

- Broad exemption definitions within federal parameters
- Automated verification using existing wage data from Employment Development Department
- Extended reporting periods if federal regulations permit flexibility
- Navigation support through CalAIM infrastructure and community partnerships
- Member-favorable appeals processes
- No state-imposed requirements beyond federal minimums

**Verification Approach**

California will likely emphasize automated data matching over member self-reporting. The state has extensive wage and employment data through its Employment Development Department (EDD), which administers unemployment insurance, disability insurance, and paid family leave. Cross-referencing Medi-Cal enrollment with EDD records could identify members with documented employment meeting hour thresholds without requiring individual reporting.

However, automated verification has limitations. Gig economy workers, cash-paid workers, self-employed individuals, and those with multiple part-time employers may not appear in EDD data or may appear with incomplete records. The agricultural sector's prevalence of farm labor contractors complicates employer-of-record identification.

For members not verifiable through automated matching, California will need reporting mechanisms scaled to millions of potential users. Online portals, call centers, and paper submissions must all function in multiple languages for populations with varying digital literacy.

**Exemption Processing**

California's ECM populations of focus substantially overlap with federal exemption categories. Individuals already identified as having serious mental illness, substance use disorders, chronic homelessness, or high medical complexity may have documentation supporting medical frailty exemptions.

The challenge is connecting existing clinical documentation to eligibility systems. Care coordinators may know a member has disabling depression, but that information may not automatically flow to county eligibility workers making exemption determinations. System integration between managed care clinical data and county eligibility systems requires development.

**Timeline to December 2026**

California faces compressed timelines for system development, staff training, member communication, and partnership establishment.

Key milestones likely include:
- Q1 2026: Final federal regulatory guidance; state implementation planning finalization
- Q2 2026: System modifications; county worker training; MCO readiness verification
- Q3 2026: Member communications; reporting system activation; navigation partnerships
- Q4 2026: Soft launch; final preparations; December 31 effective date

The simultaneous January 2026 state policy changes (asset limits, enrollment freeze) create additional system demands during this period.

## Summary: What California Is Expected to Do

California will implement federal work requirements because it has no legal alternative, but will do so with every available accommodation to minimize coverage losses. The state's approach will emphasize automated verification, maximum exemptions, and navigation support rather than enforcement and sanctions.

The fundamental challenge is scale. Systems that function for hundreds of thousands of people may fail when applied to 5 million. California cannot import implementation models from smaller states because no comparable precedent exists. The state must develop solutions at a scale never previously attempted for Medicaid work requirements.

County administration adds complexity no other state faces. Fifty-eight different eligibility operations must implement consistent processes for populations ranging from Los Angeles County's millions to Sierra County's hundreds. The state can mandate standards, but operational execution depends on county capacity that varies enormously.

Linguistic diversity demands accessibility investments beyond any other state's requirements. Spanish alone is insufficient when substantial populations speak Chinese languages, Vietnamese, Korean, Tagalog, and indigenous Mexican languages. Verification systems must function across these language communities or will systematically exclude them.

The agricultural workforce presents verification challenges specific to California's economic structure. Seasonal employment patterns conflict with monthly hour requirements. Farm labor contractor employment complicates documentation. The intersection of immigration status, agricultural employment, and work requirements creates layered complexity affecting hundreds of thousands of workers.

CalAIM infrastructure provides potential support mechanisms through ECM and Community Supports, but these systems remain underutilized. Scaling navigation capacity while still establishing baseline CalAIM functions requires simultaneous development rather than sequential building.

California's political leadership opposes work requirements philosophically but must implement them legally. This creates implementation dynamics focused on harm reduction rather than program integrity enforcement. The state will likely measure success by coverage retention rather than compliance documentation rates.

The 2026 gubernatorial election introduces uncertainty. Implementation planning proceeds under the Newsom administration, but actual enforcement begins under a successor whose priorities may differ. Transition planning should account for potential policy direction changes.

Coverage losses are inevitable regardless of implementation quality. The Urban Institute's projection of 1.2-1.4 million potential coverage losses assumes administrative barriers will affect even working, eligible individuals. California's goal should be minimizing these losses, not eliminating them entirely. The question is whether California's approach reduces projected losses from 25-30% to something substantially lower, and what "substantially lower" means when the baseline is 5 million people.

## Cross-Program Context

**SNAP Employment & Training**

California operates CalFresh Employment & Training (CFET) through the same county welfare departments administering Medi-Cal. Able-bodied adults without dependents (ABAWDs) face SNAP work requirements in non-waived counties. Integration opportunities exist for individuals subject to both SNAP and Medicaid work requirements.

However, California has historically obtained broad ABAWD waivers limiting SNAP work requirement enforcement. The populations subject to CFET requirements may not substantially overlap with Medi-Cal expansion adults in practice.

**TANF Work Requirements (CalWORKs)**

CalWORKs (California's TANF program) includes work requirements administered by county welfare departments. Welfare-to-Work participation requirements apply to CalWORKs recipients, but this population (primarily parents with children) largely qualifies for Medi-Cal work requirement exemptions under OBBBA's parent exemption.

**CalAIM Community Supports**

CalAIM's 14 Community Supports include housing-related services, employment supports, and social care coordination that could facilitate work requirement compliance. Community health workers, peer support specialists, and social care navigators operating within CalAIM could extend to work requirement navigation.

The challenge is capacity. Current Community Supports utilization is far below need. Expanding services to include work requirement support requires scaling infrastructure that hasn't yet achieved baseline targets.

**Provider Tax Structure**

California relies heavily on provider taxes and intergovernmental transfers for Medi-Cal financing. Hospital quality assurance fees, managed care organization taxes, and other assessments generate state matching funds that leverage federal dollars.

Coverage losses from work requirements reduce managed care enrollment, affecting MCO tax bases. Hospital uncompensated care would increase as previously covered individuals lose Medi-Cal. These fiscal dynamics create stakeholder interest in coverage retention beyond ideological positions.

**Covered California Marketplace**

Covered California operates one of the most robust state-based marketplaces nationally. Expansion adults losing Medi-Cal for work requirement noncompliance may qualify for marketplace coverage if their income exceeds Medicaid thresholds. Enhanced premium tax credits (if maintained) provide substantial subsidies.

However, marketplace premiums and cost-sharing exceed Medi-Cal's zero-premium, minimal cost-sharing structure. Coverage transition to marketplace represents benefit reduction even when it maintains coverage. And individuals below 138% FPL who lose Medi-Cal but qualify based on income have no marketplace alternative.
