## Work Requirement History

Massachusetts has never implemented Medicaid work requirements. The state's trajectory represents the opposite path from states like Georgia or Arkansas that sought waivers during the first Trump administration. Massachusetts built its health care system on the principle of near-universal coverage rather than conditional eligibility.

**The 2006 Reform Legacy**

In April 2006, Republican Governor Mitt Romney signed Chapter 58 of the Acts of 2006, the most comprehensive state health reform legislation in American history at that time. The law, commonly known as "Romneycare," pursued near-universal coverage through a combination of Medicaid expansion, subsidized insurance through the newly created Commonwealth Health Insurance Connector, insurance market reforms, and an individual mandate requiring residents to obtain coverage.

The Massachusetts reform served as the direct model for the Affordable Care Act's coverage provisions. The shared responsibility framework, the exchange structure, the individual mandate, and the expansion of Medicaid all derived from Massachusetts' approach. Within roughly one year of implementation, uninsurance among working-age adults dropped from approximately 13% to 7%. By 2010, 98% of Massachusetts residents had health coverage.

This history creates a distinctive political context for work requirements. Massachusetts achieved near-universal coverage without conditioning eligibility on work. The state's approach reflected a theory that coverage itself was the policy goal, not work verification as an eligibility screen. Implementing federal work requirements requires Massachusetts to adopt policy logic fundamentally at odds with its reform legacy.

**No Prior Waiver Activity**

Massachusetts never sought a Section 1115 waiver for work requirements during either Trump administration. The state actively opposed such policies during the Biden administration and filed comments criticizing CMS approvals for other states. When the One Big Beautiful Bill Act became law in July 2025, Massachusetts was among the states most philosophically opposed to work requirements and least administratively prepared to implement them.

## Current Policy and Waiver Status

**Political Landscape**

Governor Maura Healey, who took office in January 2023, leads a state government unified under Democratic control. Democrats hold supermajorities in both legislative chambers. Prior to becoming governor, Healey served as Attorney General and imposed requirements on the Beth Israel Lahey Health merger specifically focused on Medicaid access.

The Healey administration has not publicly embraced work requirements as policy but has signaled intention to implement federal mandates while minimizing coverage losses. The state's approach appears focused on what researchers have termed "coverage-protective implementation," emphasizing automatic verification, maximum exemptions, and supportive infrastructure over enforcement.

**Budget Response**

In the FY2025 closeout supplemental budget signed in November 2025, Massachusetts allocated $10 million to Health Care For All, Inc. to fund a public education campaign informing MassHealth enrollees about work requirements. The budget also included $10 million for Department of Transitional Assistance operations to address SNAP changes under OB3 that will affect overlapping populations.

The $1.67 billion appropriation for MassHealth in the same budget (with a net cost of $303 million after federal reimbursements) addressed immediate fiscal pressures while the state prepares for the more substantial challenges of 2026 and 2027.

**Waiver Renewal Context**

Massachusetts operates MassHealth under a Section 1115 demonstration waiver approved in September 2022 and running through December 2027. The waiver authorized the state's Accountable Care Organization model, health equity investments, and Health Related Social Needs (HRSN) supplemental services. The state will need to negotiate waiver amendments or renewal with CMS during the same period it implements work requirements, creating parallel negotiating tracks with potentially conflicting priorities.

## Defining Characteristics

**Delivery System Sophistication**

MassHealth operates one of the most sophisticated Medicaid delivery systems in the country. The Accountable Care Organization model, implemented in 2017, covers approximately 80% of eligible enrollees through 17 ACOs. These ACOs include both Accountable Care Partnership Plans (ACPPs), which partner with managed care organizations to create provider networks, and Primary Care ACOs (PCACOs), which operate through MassHealth's fee-for-service network with shared savings arrangements.

This infrastructure offers implementation capacity that many states lack. ACOs already manage care coordination, conduct outreach, and track member engagement. The question becomes whether this capacity can be redirected toward work requirement verification and exemption documentation without undermining the care coordination functions for which it was designed.

Beginning January 2025, MassHealth ACOs began contracting with community-based organizations for Health Related Social Needs services, including housing and nutrition supports. This HRSN infrastructure could potentially support work requirement navigation, though the services were designed for health improvement rather than compliance verification.

**Health Care Provider Concentration**

Massachusetts has the highest physician-per-capita ratio in the United States, though providers concentrate heavily in eastern Massachusetts. Mass General Brigham (16 hospitals, $7.69 billion net patient revenue), Beth Israel Lahey Health (14 hospitals, $5.73 billion NPR), and UMass Memorial Health ($3.61 billion NPR) dominate the hospital market.

These systems have financial interests in maintaining MassHealth coverage. Uncompensated care costs would increase if significant numbers of expansion adults lose coverage. However, unlike states with extensive rural hospital closures, Massachusetts does not face the same crisis narrative that might galvanize provider opposition to strict work requirement implementation.

**Technology Infrastructure**

MassHealth operates the HIway, a statewide health information exchange, and has invested in care management platforms across its ACO network. The state's 2022 waiver included significant health equity investments and data infrastructure improvements.

However, researchers analyzing Massachusetts' work requirement readiness have raised concerns about whether existing systems can support the verification functions that work requirements demand. Cross-agency data sharing for automatic verification of work hours, exemption identification, and compliance tracking may require infrastructure that does not currently exist. The state must determine "whether government systems allow for data sharing needed to automatically identify residents' compliance with work requirements and those who are exempt" within the coming months.

**Immigrant Population Considerations**

Massachusetts has the largest Cape Verdean, largest Ugandan, and largest Moroccan populations as a percentage of total population of any state. The state has significant Lusophone communities (Portuguese, Brazilian, Cape Verdean) concentrated in southeastern Massachusetts, particularly Fall River, New Bedford, and Brockton. Haitian, Cambodian, Chinese, Dominican, and various South Asian communities create substantial language access requirements.

Work requirement implementation for these populations requires communications in multiple languages, navigation assistance from culturally competent staff, and verification systems that can accommodate immigrants with limited English proficiency or unfamiliarity with American bureaucratic processes. The federal immigration policy changes under OB3 create additional complexity, as certain legally present immigrants will lose MassHealth eligibility entirely.

## Expected Approach

**Coverage-Protective Implementation**

The Healey administration appears likely to pursue implementation designed to minimize coverage losses. Policy recommendations from researchers and advocates emphasize several approaches:

Verification frequency: While federal law requires semi-annual eligibility checks, Massachusetts can avoid more frequent verification. Researchers have characterized the semi-annual process as "onerous, failure prone, and often unnecessary," suggesting the state should minimize verification intensity.

Lookback period: States can decide how many months of information to review when verifying work requirements and whether those months are consecutive. Flexible lookback approaches reduce the impact of temporary work gaps on eligibility.

Automatic verification: Massachusetts can leverage cross-agency data matching from unemployment insurance filings, state tax records, and other administrative databases to verify compliance without requiring member-initiated reporting. This approach shifts burden from enrollees to the state.

Exemption identification: Proactive identification of individuals qualifying for exemptions (medical conditions, caregiving responsibilities, age, pregnancy, etc.) before requiring work verification reduces both coverage losses and administrative burden.

**Projected Coverage Impacts**

Estimates of potential coverage losses vary widely:

- Urban Institute and Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation: 100,000-200,000 MassHealth members
- Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts Foundation CEO: approximately 300,000 across MassHealth and Health Connector combined
- Congressional Budget Office: approximately 326,000 Massachusetts residents losing coverage under OB3 overall

The wide range reflects uncertainty about verification systems, exemption implementation, and behavioral responses. As one analysis noted, "Wide ranges like these reflect something more than the normal uncertainty of forecasting. They speak to a profound question about our state's ability to accurately determine compliance and keep eligible residents covered."

**Timeline Pressures**

Federal CMS guidance on work requirement implementation is not expected until June 2026, six months before the January 2027 effective date. Massachusetts researchers have warned that "waiting for near-final rules to arrive next summer would make it impossible for Massachusetts to adapt its enrollment procedures."

The state has the option to request a delay until December 2028 if it demonstrates "good faith effort" to comply, but approval depends on the discretion of the HHS Secretary. Researchers describe this dispensation as "far from assured."

The Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts Foundation has recommended that Governor Healey or Lieutenant Governor Driscoll create and lead an implementation team "with a remit for aggressive implementation and a focus akin to the COVID-era command center" that Massachusetts established during the pandemic.

## Cross-Program Context

**SNAP Coordination**

Massachusetts implemented SNAP changes under OB3 beginning November 2025. The expanded Able-Bodied Adults Without Dependents (ABAWD) work requirements now apply to parents with teens 14 and older, homeless individuals, veterans, and people up to age 65. The Department of Transitional Assistance expects approximately 99,000 additional people to face SNAP work requirements over the coming year.

This creates both challenges and opportunities for MassHealth work requirements. Many individuals subject to Medicaid work requirements will also face SNAP work requirements, creating potential for cross-program deemed compliance similar to what Michigan implemented in 2020. However, the overlapping documentation burdens could also multiply administrative failures if systems are not coordinated.

**TANF Integration**

Massachusetts operates its Transitional Aid to Families with Dependent Children (TAFDC) program with work requirements for cash assistance recipients. TAFDC serves a narrower population than MassHealth expansion, primarily families with children receiving cash assistance. Integration between TAFDC and MassHealth work verification could reduce burden for families participating in both programs.

**Provider Tax Considerations**

Massachusetts utilizes provider taxes (hospital assessments, nursing facility assessments) for Medicaid financing. Significant coverage losses would affect provider revenues and potentially reduce the base for provider tax calculations. However, Massachusetts has not relied on provider taxes to the same degree as states like New York or California.

**Health Safety Net**

Massachusetts operates the Health Safety Net, which provides emergency coverage for uninsured residents and reimburses hospitals for uncompensated care. The program already faces funding shortfalls. Coverage losses from work requirements would increase uncompensated care costs and strain the Safety Net further.

Researchers have suggested Massachusetts could expand the Safety Net into a "minicaid" providing state-funded coverage for primary care, emergency care, preventive services, and chronic disease management for people who lose MassHealth eligibility but cannot access marketplace coverage.

**Marketplace Infrastructure**

The Massachusetts Health Connector, one of the original state-based health insurance exchanges, provides robust infrastructure for coverage transitions. Expansion adults losing MassHealth coverage may qualify for Connector coverage with subsidies depending on income. However, enhanced ACA subsidies are set to expire at the end of 2025 unless Congress extends them, potentially making marketplace coverage unaffordable for many.

## Summary: What Massachusetts Is Expected to Do

Massachusetts will implement federal work requirements by January 2027 with maximum emphasis on coverage protection. The state's approach will likely feature automatic verification through data matching, proactive exemption identification, minimum verification frequency (semi-annual only), flexible lookback periods, and robust member education and navigation support.

The $10 million public education campaign through Health Care For All represents the opening salvo in an effort to ensure MassHealth members understand requirements and can document compliance or exemptions before facing adverse actions. The state's ACO infrastructure and HRSN provider network offer implementation capacity, though redirecting these resources toward compliance verification creates tensions with their care coordination missions.

Massachusetts faces particular challenges with its diverse immigrant populations. Language access across Portuguese, Spanish, Haitian Creole, Khmer, Mandarin, Cantonese, Vietnamese, Arabic, and other languages requires translation of all member communications and availability of navigation assistance in community languages. Cultural competency in explaining American bureaucratic requirements to recent immigrants adds complexity.

The rural-urban divide presents different challenges than in states like Michigan or Pennsylvania. Western Massachusetts has lower population density and fewer services, but the concentration of MassHealth members in eastern urban areas means the bulk of implementation activity will occur in Greater Boston, Worcester, and Springfield where provider and social service infrastructure is relatively robust.

Massachusetts' 2006 reform legacy shapes the political context for implementation. Work requirements represent a policy logic fundamentally at odds with the shared responsibility model that achieved near-universal coverage. State officials and advocates will likely frame implementation as protecting Massachusetts residents from federal policy rather than embracing work requirements as state policy.

The compressed timeline creates substantial risk. Beginning implementation design before CMS guidance arrives requires making assumptions that federal rules may subsequently contradict. But waiting for guidance leaves insufficient time to build verification infrastructure, train staff, and educate members before requirements take effect.

Whether Massachusetts can implement work requirements while maintaining the near-universal coverage that has defined the state since 2006 remains the central question. The state has advantages: sophisticated delivery systems, concentrated populations, robust marketplace infrastructure, and political commitment to coverage protection. But verification systems that do not yet exist must function at scale within 13 months. The gap between aspiration and operational capacity will determine outcomes for hundreds of thousands of Massachusetts residents.
