## Work Requirement History

Illinois has no prior Medicaid work requirement experience. The state did not apply for a work requirement waiver during the first Trump administration, and the Pritzker administration has consistently opposed conditioning healthcare coverage on employment verification.

Governor JB Pritzker expanded Medicaid eligibility when Illinois was an early expansion state in 2014 and has vocally criticized federal efforts to impose work requirements. In February 2025, Pritzker joined other governors in opposing proposed Medicaid cuts, stating that more than three million Illinoisans depend on the program and that no state could backfill billions in potential federal funding losses.

The state's approach to Medicaid reform has emphasized simplification rather than conditionality. In 2019, Governor Pritzker signed comprehensive Medicaid reform legislation (SB 1321) that streamlined eligibility determination, reduced income documentation to a single pay stub, and improved MCO transparency and accountability. This legislative framework reflects Illinois's philosophical commitment to reducing administrative barriers rather than adding them.

## Current Policy and Waiver Status

**Healthcare Transformation 1115 Waiver**

Illinois received CMS approval in July 2024 for a significant expansion of its 1115 demonstration waiver, renamed the Healthcare Transformation Waiver. Originally approved in 2018 for behavioral health services, the extended waiver authorizes coverage of health-related social needs (HRSN) services that directly address barriers to work and self-sufficiency.

The waiver includes four major components:

*Health-Related Social Needs Services:* Illinois can now cover housing supports including first month's rent, moving expenses, utility hookups, and temporary housing before and after hospitalization. Nutrition services and non-medical transportation are also covered. Eligibility requires Medicaid enrollment, managed care participation, and documented medical need.

*Violence Prevention and Intervention:* Illinois is the first state nationally to receive 1115 approval for violence prevention services. The waiver covers psychotherapy, grief counseling, art therapy, life skills training, and crisis intervention for individuals who have survived violence, are experiencing violence, or are at elevated risk.

*Pre-Release Services:* The waiver authorizes coverage for incarcerated individuals for 90 days before expected release, including case management to assess physical, behavioral, and social needs, plus ensuring a 30-day supply of medications and needed medical equipment upon release.

*Supported Employment Services:* Continuing from the original demonstration, the waiver covers job coaching, benefits counseling, and follow-along supports for Medicaid beneficiaries with behavioral health conditions.

State officials estimate implementation of new services will take at least a year, with a phased approach engaging community partners in service design. The waiver's infrastructure funding provisions support capacity building, though the state must maintain existing investments to avoid supplanting current funding sources.

**State-Based Marketplace Transition**

Illinois is launching Get Covered Illinois as a state-based health insurance marketplace in 2026, replacing reliance on Healthcare.gov. Open enrollment for the new marketplace began November 1, 2025. The state invested $6.5 million in navigator grants to build community-based enrollment assistance infrastructure.

This transition gains significance in the work requirement context. Expansion adults losing Medicaid coverage for noncompliance may qualify for marketplace coverage with subsidies, though the expiration of enhanced premium tax credits at the end of 2025 will increase costs substantially. Without extension of the enhanced credits, families could face average monthly premium increases of $130 or more, potentially making marketplace coverage unaffordable for workers losing Medicaid.

## Defining Characteristics

**Political Environment**

Illinois is among the bluest states in the nation, with unified Democratic control of state government. Governor Pritzker, Lieutenant Governor Juliana Stratton, and Democratic legislative majorities have consistently opposed federal policies they view as harmful to low-income residents. This political alignment suggests Illinois will implement work requirements with maximum available exemptions and minimum friction.

The state has positioned itself in opposition to the Trump administration on multiple policy fronts, creating political incentives to demonstrate that protective implementation can succeed. Whether this adversarial posture helps or hinders federal approval of implementation plans remains uncertain.

**Administrative Structure**

Illinois operates a state-administered Medicaid program through the Department of Healthcare and Family Services (HFS), with eligibility determination handled through the Department of Human Services (DHS). The two agencies share responsibility for different aspects of coverage determination, creating coordination challenges that work requirement implementation will intensify.

The Application for Benefits Eligibility (ABE) portal provides a unified online application for Medicaid, SNAP, and other programs. This integrated infrastructure could support cross-program deemed compliance if federal regulations permit. However, the state's eligibility systems experienced challenges during the post-pandemic unwinding, and adding work verification requirements will strain already stretched administrative capacity.

**Managed Care Infrastructure**

Illinois operates HealthChoice Illinois (HCI) as its primary managed care program, serving approximately 80% of Medicaid beneficiaries. Five MCOs participate statewide:

- Aetna Better Health of Illinois (CVS Health)
- Blue Cross Community Health Plan (Health Care Service Corporation)
- CountyCare Health Plan (Cook County Health, Cook County only)
- Meridian Health Plan (Centene, statewide plus specialized YouthCare for foster youth)
- Molina Healthcare of Illinois

The MCO contracts are scheduled for reprocurement in 2026, creating alignment between work requirement implementation and new managed care contracting. This timing allows the state to incorporate work requirement compliance support into MCO performance expectations from the outset.

CountyCare's Cook County focus creates a distinctive model: a public health system operating its own managed care plan in the state's largest population center. Cook County Health has been aggressive in enrolling justice-involved individuals in Medicaid before release, creating infrastructure relevant to the pre-release services authorized under the 1115 waiver.

**Safety-Net Provider Infrastructure**

Illinois has robust safety-net hospital infrastructure, particularly in Chicago. Cook County Health operates Stroger Hospital and a network of community health centers serving as the core safety-net system for Cook County. University of Illinois Health serves another major population. Statewide, federally qualified health centers provide primary care access in underserved communities.

About 50% of all births in Illinois are covered by Medicaid, and roughly 80% of people served by community mental health centers are Medicaid customers. This deep integration between Medicaid and the provider system creates strong stakeholder interest in maintaining coverage and minimizing work requirement terminations.

**Provider Tax Reliance**

Illinois utilizes provider taxes (hospital assessment, nursing facility quality assurance assessment) for Medicaid financing, generating state matching funds that leverage federal dollars. Federal restrictions on increasing provider taxes beyond current levels, enacted in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, will constrain future financing flexibility and potentially limit the state's ability to invest in work requirement support infrastructure.

## Expected Implementation Approach

**Philosophy and Design Principles**

Illinois will almost certainly implement work requirements with the goal of minimizing coverage losses. The Pritzker administration's policy orientation, the state's 1115 waiver investments in addressing social determinants of health, and the navigator infrastructure being built for Get Covered Illinois all point toward a protective implementation model.

Specific design choices are expected to include:

*Maximum Exemptions:* Illinois will likely adopt broad exemption categories covering individuals with serious mental illness, substance use disorders, chronic health conditions, caregiving responsibilities, pregnancy and postpartum status, disability, and housing instability. The state's HRSN infrastructure provides documentation pathways for exemptions based on social needs.

*Cross-Program Deemed Compliance:* If federally permitted, Illinois will establish automatic compliance recognition for individuals meeting work requirements through SNAP or TANF. The ABE portal's integrated structure supports this approach technically, though implementation requires careful data matching.

*Annual Reporting:* Following Georgia's October 2025 pivot away from monthly verification, Illinois will likely adopt annual or semi-annual reporting requirements rather than monthly documentation burdens. Georgia's experience demonstrates that monthly verification systems cannot be operationalized at scale.

*Presumptive Compliance:* Illinois may implement presumptive compliance provisions that assume work or exemption status based on data matching, requiring enrollees to respond only when discrepancies are identified. This reverses the burden of proof from the individual to the state.

*Reconsideration and Cure Periods:* Generous cure periods and simplified reinstatement processes will help minimize terminations for procedural failures among individuals who are actually working or exempt.

**HRSN Integration**

Illinois's 1115 waiver creates distinctive infrastructure for addressing barriers to work. The violence prevention services, housing supports, and pre-release coverage authorized under the waiver directly address circumstances that might otherwise result in work requirement noncompliance.

A person experiencing housing instability could receive HRSN housing services that stabilize their living situation, making employment possible. An individual leaving incarceration receives 90 days of pre-release services ensuring continuity of care and medication, plus case management addressing reentry barriers. The waiver's supported employment services specifically target individuals with behavioral health conditions who face work barriers.

Whether federal guidance permits integration of HRSN services with work requirement compliance support remains uncertain. However, Illinois's existing waiver authorization provides legal foundation for addressing social barriers that undermine work capacity.

**MCO Roles**

The 2026 MCO reprocurement will incorporate work requirement responsibilities into managed care contracts. MCOs will likely be required to:

- Identify members at risk of noncompliance through predictive analytics
- Conduct proactive outreach before reporting deadlines
- Provide navigation assistance for verification documentation
- Connect members with employment services and exemption pathways
- Track compliance status and intervene before terminations
- Report on compliance rates as a performance metric

Given the economics of Medicaid managed care, MCOs have strong financial incentives to maintain enrollment. Complex populations with behavioral health conditions or social needs generate higher risk-adjusted payments, making retention investments financially rational.

**Geographic Considerations**

Implementation must accommodate Illinois's extreme geographic diversity. Chicago and Cook County contain infrastructure, transportation, and employment opportunities that rural southern Illinois lacks. Downstate communities face provider shortages, limited public transportation, and fewer employment options.

The navigator infrastructure being built for Get Covered Illinois could be leveraged for work requirement support, particularly if navigators are authorized to assist with compliance documentation. However, capacity in rural areas remains a concern, and the state may need targeted investments in downstate support infrastructure.

**Timeline**

The federal work requirement deadline of December 31, 2026, provides Illinois approximately 12 months from now to build implementation systems. Key milestones include:

- Late 2025: Federal regulatory guidance clarifies requirements
- Early 2026: State implementation planning and system development
- Mid-2026: MCO reprocurement incorporates work requirement expectations
- Fall 2026: Member communications and reporting system activation
- December 2026: Work requirements take effect

Illinois may request delayed implementation until 2028 if the state cannot operationalize compliant systems by the deadline. Given the state's political orientation and implementation philosophy, delay would likely be framed as ensuring proper protections are in place rather than as opposition to requirements.

## Summary: What Illinois Is Expected to Do

Illinois will implement federal work requirements with extensive protective measures designed to minimize coverage losses. The state's political environment, administrative capacity, and HRSN infrastructure all support a coverage-retention approach.

The scale of Illinois's expansion population means implementation outcomes will significantly affect national assessment of work requirements. If Illinois achieves high compliance rates through proactive engagement and barrier removal rather than aggressive enforcement, it demonstrates that work requirements can function without causing the coverage losses seen in Arkansas. If Illinois experiences significant losses despite protective implementation, it raises fundamental questions about whether any design can prevent harm at scale.

The Healthcare Transformation 1115 waiver positions Illinois uniquely to address root causes of noncompliance. Rather than simply verifying work hours, the state can address housing instability, violence exposure, reentry challenges, and behavioral health conditions that undermine work capacity. Whether this holistic approach proves more effective than compliance-focused enforcement will inform national policy debates.

Illinois's adversarial relationship with the Trump administration creates political uncertainty. Federal approval of implementation plans may face delays or modifications. The state's willingness to fight legally if it perceives federal overreach adds litigation risk to implementation planning.

The November 2026 midterm elections occur just weeks before work requirements take effect. Electoral outcomes could shift federal priorities, affecting oversight intensity and enforcement discretion. Illinois's implementation approach may influence other blue states navigating the same political terrain.

## Cross-Program Context

**SNAP Employment & Training**

Illinois operates SNAP E&T programs and recently received a partial one-year ABAWD waiver (through January 2026) rather than the two-year waiver requested. The federal limitation signals tightening oversight of work requirement exemptions across programs. If deemed compliance between SNAP and Medicaid is permitted, alignment between the two programs' work requirements would reduce burden for participants meeting requirements through either program.

**TANF Work Requirements**

Illinois TANF includes work requirements for cash assistance recipients, administered through the same DHS infrastructure that handles Medicaid eligibility. Cross-program coordination could simplify verification for families receiving both TANF and Medicaid.

**Provider Tax Restrictions**

Federal restrictions on provider tax increases beyond current levels will constrain Illinois's financing options. The state relies on hospital assessments to generate Medicaid matching funds; inability to increase these taxes limits resources available for implementation infrastructure or coverage backfill.

**Marketplace Transition**

The Get Covered Illinois marketplace launch creates both opportunity and risk. The navigator network and simplified enrollment systems could facilitate transitions for individuals losing Medicaid eligibility. However, premium increases following enhanced credit expiration may make marketplace coverage unaffordable, leaving work requirement noncompliers uninsured rather than transitioning to alternative coverage.

**Federal-State Tensions**

Illinois's confrontational stance toward the Trump administration spans multiple policy domains including immigration, DEI, and healthcare. Work requirement implementation adds another arena for conflict. Whether collaboration or litigation characterizes the federal-state relationship will shape implementation possibilities and constraints.
