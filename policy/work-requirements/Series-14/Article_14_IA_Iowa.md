## Work Requirement History

Iowa has no prior Section 1115 Medicaid work requirement implementation but has relevant experience with conditionality through its Iowa Health and Wellness Plan design.

**Iowa Health and Wellness Plan: Hybrid Expansion**

Iowa accepted Medicaid expansion in 2013 but through a distinctive hybrid structure. The Iowa Health and Wellness Plan (IHAWP) divided the expansion population into two groups:

*Iowa Wellness Plan:* Members with income 0-100% FPL enrolled in traditional Medicaid managed care.

*Marketplace Choice:* Members with income 100-138% FPL initially enrolled in qualified health plans on the ACA marketplace, with Medicaid paying premiums. This premium assistance model was unique nationally.

In 2014, Iowa began transitioning Marketplace Choice members back to traditional Medicaid managed care following CMS concerns and administrative challenges. By 2016, most expansion adults were in unified managed care.

**Healthy Behaviors Incentives**

Iowa's original expansion design included healthy behaviors incentives similar to Indiana's POWER accounts, though less stringent. Members completing annual wellness exams and health risk assessments received modest incentives. Unlike Indiana, failure to complete healthy behaviors did not result in coverage consequences.

This experience provides Iowa with precedent for tracking member engagement with program requirements, though without enforcement consequences the infrastructure may not translate directly to work requirement administration.

**Member Engagement Requirements**

Under current IHAWP rules, members must participate in health risk assessments and develop wellness plans with their managed care organizations. These requirements create ongoing member-program interaction that work requirement verification could build upon.

The MCO relationship infrastructure exists; whether it can support employment verification rather than health engagement is untested.

## Current Policy and Waiver Status

**2025 Waiver Amendment**

Iowa submitted its Section 1115 waiver amendment in April 2025 requesting work requirement authority for the expansion population. The application reflects Iowa's distinctive economic context: a state with labor shortages rather than job scarcity.

Core design elements:

*Work Emphasis Over Exemption:* Iowa's proposal emphasizes connecting members to employment rather than managing exemptions. In a state where employers cannot fill positions, the policy rationale focuses on workforce participation rather than compliance enforcement.

*Employer Partnership Model:* The waiver application emphasizes partnerships with Iowa Workforce Development and major employers. Members not meeting requirements through existing employment receive referrals to workforce development services and employer recruitment programs.

*Agricultural Accommodation:* Recognizing seasonal agricultural employment patterns, Iowa proposes annualized hour calculations. Members can demonstrate 960 hours annually (equivalent to 80 hours monthly) rather than meeting monthly thresholds. This accommodates workers with 60-hour weeks during planting/harvest and reduced hours in winter.

*Meatpacking Industry Coordination:* Given the meatpacking industry's central role in Iowa's economy and its high proportion of expansion-eligible workers, the waiver includes provisions for employer-based verification. Major meatpacking employers (Tyson, JBS, Smithfield) can provide employment verification directly to the state.

*Exemption Categories:* Standard exemptions apply: pregnancy, disability, caregiving, students, SUD treatment participation. Iowa's proposal does not expand exemptions beyond federal minimums, reflecting the labor shortage context where employment opportunities exist.

**Legislative Support**

Iowa's Republican-controlled legislature and Republican governor strongly support work requirements. No significant political opposition exists. Legislation enacted in 2024 directed the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services to pursue implementation aligned with federal timelines and authorized appropriations for administrative systems.

**Administrative Preparation**

Iowa DHS has been developing implementation infrastructure:

- Integration with Iowa Workforce Development systems for job matching and verification
- MCO contract modifications for member engagement and referral
- Employer partnership agreements for verification data sharing
- System modifications building on existing IHAWP wellness tracking
- Training for eligibility workers and MCO care coordinators

## Defining Characteristics

**Labor Shortage Context**

Iowa's defining characteristic is implementing work requirements in a labor shortage environment rather than a job scarcity environment. This fundamentally changes the policy logic.

In Kentucky or Appalachian Ohio, work requirements face the challenge of requiring employment that doesn't exist. In Iowa, the challenge is different: employers cannot fill available positions. The policy question shifts from "where will people find work" to "why aren't available workers connecting with available jobs."

This context shapes Iowa's approach:

*Workforce Connection Emphasis:* The goal becomes matching workers with employers rather than documenting compliance. Iowa's workforce development system and employer partnerships are central rather than peripheral.

*Barrier Removal Focus:* If jobs exist and workers exist but connection isn't happening, barriers must be preventing connection. Transportation, childcare, skills mismatch, and information gaps become the focus rather than job creation.

*Enforcement as Last Resort:* With employers actively recruiting, most members should achieve compliance through employment. Enforcement becomes relevant only for members who cannot or will not connect with available opportunities.

*Meatpacking as Available Employment:* The meatpacking industry consistently has openings. Work in meatpacking plants is difficult, physically demanding, and often unpleasant. But it exists, pays reasonably well, and provides employer-sponsored health coverage. Whether members should be required to accept meatpacking work when other options are unavailable raises policy questions Iowa's design must address.

**Agricultural Seasonality**

Iowa's agricultural economy creates work hour patterns that poorly match monthly requirements. A corn farmer's work schedule illustrates the challenge:

- March-May: Planting season, 70+ hours weekly
- June-August: Crop maintenance, 40-50 hours weekly
- September-November: Harvest season, 80+ hours weekly
- December-February: Equipment maintenance, planning, 20-30 hours weekly

Monthly hour requirements would show this farmer non-compliant in winter despite full-time annual employment. Iowa's annualized hour calculation addresses this pattern, but the approach requires tracking systems that can aggregate hours across seasons.

Similar patterns affect livestock operations, custom farming operations, and agricultural services. The employment is real and often intensive, but not evenly distributed across months.

**Meatpacking Workforce Dynamics**

Meatpacking plants are Iowa's largest industrial employers and disproportionately employ Medicaid expansion adults. The workforce characteristics create specific implementation considerations:

*Immigrant and Refugee Workforce:* Meatpacking plants in Storm Lake, Marshalltown, Denison, and Columbus Junction have majority-immigrant workforces. Many workers are refugees (Burmese, Somali, Congolese) or immigrants (Mexican, Guatemalan, Salvadoran). Language access for verification is essential.

*Documentation Complexity:* Employment verification for immigrant workers may involve work authorization documentation, name variations, and employer records in formats unfamiliar to state systems.

*Turnover Rates:* Meatpacking experiences high turnover due to physically demanding conditions. A member employed in January may leave by March, work at a different plant by June, and return to the original employer by September. Verification systems must handle frequent employer changes.

*Injury and Leave Patterns:* Meatpacking has high injury rates. Workers on leave for injuries may qualify for exemptions but need documentation of leave status. The intersection of workers' compensation, medical leave, and work requirements requires careful coordination.

**Small State Advantages**

Iowa's modest expansion population (150,000-180,000) creates implementation advantages larger states lack:

*Manageable Verification Volume:* Processing 150,000 compliance determinations is operationally feasible in ways that processing Ohio's 700,000 is not. Iowa can implement approaches requiring more individualized attention.

*Workforce Development Capacity:* Iowa Workforce Development can meaningfully engage with the expansion population. Caseloads per workforce development staff remain manageable. The system can provide actual employment services rather than just processing paperwork.

*MCO Relationships:* Iowa contracts with three MCOs for Medicaid managed care: Amerigroup Iowa, Iowa Total Care (Centene), and Molina Healthcare. With three MCOs serving a modest population, the state can maintain closer oversight and coordination than states with more complex managed care landscapes.

*Geographic Accessibility:* No Iowan is more than 90 minutes from a Workforce Development center or MCO service location. The geographic barriers facing eastern Kentucky or rural Arizona do not exist in Iowa.

**Rural Verification Challenges**

Despite advantages, rural Iowa presents verification challenges:

*Informal Agricultural Employment:* Farm labor often occurs through informal arrangements. A member helping neighbors with harvest may work 60 hours in a week with no documentation other than a handshake agreement.

*Self-Employment Documentation:* Many rural Iowans are self-employed in farming, custom work, or small businesses. Documenting self-employment hours requires systems beyond wage verification.

*Internet Access:* While better than Appalachian regions, rural Iowa broadband access remains limited. Online verification portals may be inaccessible in some communities.

## Expected Policy Posture and Timeline

**Anticipated Approach: Workforce Connection Focus**

Iowa's implementation philosophy will likely emphasize connecting members to available employment rather than punishing non-compliance. The labor shortage context makes enforcement less central than facilitation.

Expected elements:

*Employer Recruitment Integration:* Workforce Development will actively match members with employer openings. The goal is employment placement, not compliance documentation.

*Agricultural Accommodation:* Annualized hour calculations will accommodate seasonal work patterns. Monthly verification will not disqualify farmers and agricultural workers with legitimate seasonal variation.

*Rapid Exemption Processing:* Members with genuine barriers to employment will receive expedited exemption processing. The state has capacity for individualized determinations that larger states lack.

*Meatpacking as Compliance Pathway:* Available meatpacking employment will be offered to members seeking work. Whether members can decline meatpacking positions and remain compliant through job search activities alone will test the system's flexibility.

**Timeline**

- April 2025: Waiver amendment submitted
- Summer 2025: CMS review and negotiation
- Fall 2025: Anticipated approval; system development
- Winter 2025-2026: MCO contract modifications; employer partnership finalization
- Spring 2026: Pilot implementation
- December 2026: Full implementation aligned with federal deadline

**Key Uncertainties**

*Agricultural Hour Tracking:* Whether Iowa can operationalize annualized hour tracking for agricultural workers without creating documentation burdens that undermine the accommodation remains uncertain.

*Meatpacking Worker Treatment:* How Iowa handles members who decline available meatpacking employment will test whether the system functions as workforce connection or compliance enforcement.

*Immigrant Workforce Verification:* Whether verification systems can appropriately serve the immigrant and refugee populations concentrated in meatpacking communities depends on language access and documentation flexibility not yet tested.

*Self-Employment Documentation:* Rural self-employment verification requires systems Iowa has not previously operated. Whether the approach works for farmers, custom operators, and small business owners will affect rural coverage outcomes.

## Summary: What Iowa Is Expected to Do

Iowa will implement work requirements in a labor shortage environment where the policy challenge differs from most other states. Jobs exist; employers actively recruit; the question is connecting available workers with available positions rather than requiring work where none exists.

The workforce connection emphasis will likely produce different implementation dynamics than enforcement-focused states. Iowa Workforce Development and employer partnerships become central. Meatpacking industry coordination provides verification pathways for a substantial portion of the expansion population.

Agricultural seasonality requires annualized hour tracking that accommodates legitimate work patterns poorly matched to monthly requirements. Whether this accommodation works administratively will determine whether agricultural workers maintain coverage or face compliance failures during winter months despite full-time annual employment.

Iowa's modest population and manageable verification volume create implementation advantages larger states lack. The state can provide more individualized attention and genuine workforce development services rather than purely administrative compliance processing.

The critical test is whether workforce connection philosophy translates to practice. If Iowa genuinely helps members find employment, outcomes should be positive given available jobs. If the system functions as compliance enforcement despite the workforce connection rhetoric, the labor shortage context won't prevent coverage losses among members struggling with documentation rather than employment.

## Cross-Program Context

**SNAP E&T Alignment**

Iowa operates SNAP Employment & Training for overlapping populations. The state's waiver includes deemed compliance provisions: members meeting SNAP work requirements are automatically compliant for Medicaid. Given Iowa's labor shortage context, SNAP E&T alignment provides efficiency and reduces duplicative burden.

**TANF Work Requirements**

Iowa's Family Investment Program (FIP/TANF) includes work requirements with established workforce development partnerships. Infrastructure and employer relationships from TANF support Medicaid implementation.

**Iowa Workforce Development Integration**

IowaWORKS, the state's workforce development system, is explicitly integrated into implementation planning. Participation in IowaWORKS programs counts as qualifying activity. Members not meeting requirements through employment receive IowaWORKS referrals for job matching and training.

**Agricultural Coordination**

Iowa's agricultural economy requires coordination with farm organizations and agricultural employers. The Iowa Farm Bureau and commodity organizations may play roles in communicating requirements to agricultural workers and facilitating verification.

**Provider Tax Considerations**

Iowa relies moderately on hospital assessments for Medicaid financing. Rural hospitals serving agricultural communities have interest in coverage maintenance. Coverage losses among the agricultural workforce would increase uncompensated care in rural facilities already operating on thin margins.
