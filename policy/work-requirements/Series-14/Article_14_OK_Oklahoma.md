## Work Requirement History

Oklahoma has a complicated relationship with Medicaid work requirements. The state actively pursued work requirements before voters intervened through the constitutional amendment process.

**SoonerCare 2.0 Attempt**

In March 2020, Governor Kevin Stitt unveiled a plan called SoonerCare 2.0 that would have implemented a partial Medicaid expansion with significant restrictions. The plan sought federal approval under the Trump administration's Healthy Adult Opportunity initiative and included community engagement requirements mandating work, education, training, or volunteerism as conditions of eligibility. The proposal also included per-capita spending caps and premiums for the expansion population.

Governor Stitt attended a press conference with CMS Administrator Seema Verma in January 2020 where the administration announced support for state flexibility in implementing work requirements. The Trump administration characterized work requirements as promoting personal responsibility and community engagement.

**Voter Intervention**

While the state was pursuing its restrictive approach, advocates collected signatures for State Question 802, a constitutional amendment to require full Medicaid expansion without additional restrictions. The initiative passed narrowly on June 30, 2020, with 50.45% of the vote, making Oklahoma the first state to expand Medicaid through a constitutional amendment.

The constitutional language includes a critical provision: Section 2(B) states that "No greater or additional burdens or restrictions on eligibility or enrollment shall be imposed on persons eligible for medical assistance pursuant to this Article than on any other population eligible for medical assistance under Oklahoma's Medicaid program."

This provision was specifically designed to prevent the state from implementing work requirements, premiums, or other restrictions that the legislature and governor had sought. Advocates learned from experiences in Maine, Nebraska, Idaho, and Utah, where governors and legislatures attempted to undermine voter-approved expansions, and chose to embed expansion in the state constitution rather than statute.

**Implementation Without State-Imposed Requirements**

Medicaid expansion took effect July 1, 2021, without the work requirements the Stitt administration had sought. By August 2021, over 150,000 Oklahomans had enrolled. Enrollment has continued to grow, reaching approximately 237,000 expansion adults by June 2025.

The constitutional protection meant Oklahoma could not voluntarily implement work requirements even when the first Trump administration offered approval. However, the federal mandate in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act creates a different dynamic: the requirement comes from federal law rather than state choice.

## Current Policy and Waiver Status

**Constitutional Tension**

Oklahoma faces a unique legal situation. The state constitution prohibits imposing greater restrictions on expansion adults than on other Medicaid populations. Federal law now mandates work requirements specifically for expansion adults. This creates a direct conflict between state constitutional provisions and federal Medicaid requirements.

Legal scholars and advocates are examining whether the state can implement federal work requirements without violating the constitutional provision that voters approved. Several interpretations are possible:

The constitutional language prohibits the state from voluntarily imposing additional restrictions but may not prevent compliance with federal requirements that apply to all states. Under this interpretation, Oklahoma would implement federal work requirements as mandated by federal law, which would supersede state constitutional provisions under the Supremacy Clause.

Alternatively, the constitutional provision could be interpreted as prohibiting any work requirements regardless of source, potentially forcing Oklahoma to choose between its constitutional commitment and continued participation in Medicaid expansion at the 90% federal matching rate.

No court has addressed this question, and the Oklahoma Attorney General has not issued a formal opinion. The resolution of this tension will significantly affect implementation approach.

**SoonerSelect Managed Care Transition**

Oklahoma transitioned its Medicaid program to managed care through SoonerSelect in April 2024. Three contracted entities now serve the expansion population for medical services: Aetna Better Health of Oklahoma (CVS Health subsidiary), Humana Healthy Horizons of Oklahoma, and Oklahoma Complete Health (Centene subsidiary). Oklahoma Complete Health also serves the children's specialty program.

The SoonerSelect contracts are valued at $3.75 billion for the initial 15-month period. The managed care transition provides infrastructure that could facilitate work requirement implementation, as MCOs have member engagement capabilities and data systems that could support verification and exemption processing.

American Indian and Alaska Native members can opt into SoonerSelect but are not required to enroll in managed care. This provision respects tribal sovereignty and maintains direct access to Indian Health Service facilities. AI/AN members who do not opt into SoonerSelect continue receiving SoonerCare coverage through the traditional fee-for-service program.

**Federal Funding and Hospital Impact**

Oklahoma's Medicaid program receives federal matching at varying rates: 90% for expansion adults, 67% for low-income adults, seniors, and people with disabilities, and 77% for children. The enhanced federal match for expansion makes the program significantly more affordable than traditional Medicaid populations.

The Oklahoma Hospital Association projects $6.3-8.7 billion in federal reimbursement losses over the next decade due to Medicaid changes under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Rural hospitals face particular vulnerability; the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform identified 59% of Oklahoma's rural hospitals as at risk of closure, with most at-risk facilities in isolated communities where closure would force residents to travel long distances for emergency and inpatient care.

The state implemented enhanced directed payments under SoonerSelect, distributing approximately $500 million annually to hospitals to bridge the gap between Medicaid reimbursement and commercial insurance rates. Hospitals received $252.4 million in April 2024 as the first payment under this program. These funds help rural hospitals in particular by providing predictable cash flow for capital improvements and workforce investment.

## Defining Characteristics

**Tribal Complexity**

Oklahoma's tribal population creates implementation complexities unlike any other state. With 39 federally recognized tribes and 17% of SoonerCare enrollment being American Indian or Alaska Native, the state must navigate sophisticated tribal consultation requirements and respect sovereignty concerns.

The federal exemption for AI/AN populations from work requirements addresses a significant portion of the potentially affected population. However, implementation requires robust verification systems to identify AI/AN enrollees and process exemptions automatically. Tribal enrollment documentation varies across nations, and some individuals may be eligible for IHS services without formal tribal enrollment.

IHS facilities in Oklahoma rely heavily on Medicaid reimbursement, with some facilities deriving 30-60% of their operating budgets from Medicaid revenue. Coverage losses among AI/AN members who fail to properly document their exemption status could affect IHS facility revenues and services for entire tribal communities.

**Constitutional Protection as Implementation Constraint**

The State Question 802 constitutional provision creates an unusual implementation environment. While other states have discretion to design enforcement-oriented or coverage-protective approaches, Oklahoma must consider whether any implementation choice violates its constitutional commitment to not impose greater burdens on expansion adults.

This constraint may push Oklahoma toward maximum use of federal exemptions, automated verification, and minimal reporting requirements. The state cannot legally design a high-friction system intended to reduce enrollment if that system imposes greater burdens than those faced by traditional Medicaid populations.

The practical effect may be that Oklahoma's implementation approach is constrained to the coverage-protective end of the spectrum regardless of the Stitt administration's policy preferences. Whether courts would enforce this interpretation remains untested.

**Rural Healthcare Fragility**

Oklahoma's rural healthcare infrastructure cannot absorb significant coverage losses. Nine rural hospital closures since 2005 have already created care deserts in some communities. The 35+ critical-access hospitals exempt from provider taxes are particularly vulnerable to revenue disruptions.

Work requirements that cause coverage losses in rural areas would reduce hospital revenues, potentially triggering additional closures. The cascade effects would extend beyond Medicaid: rural hospitals serve as community employers, emergency response resources, and healthcare access points for all residents regardless of insurance status.

The state's investment in enhanced directed payments through SoonerSelect demonstrates awareness of rural hospital vulnerability. Work requirement implementation that undermines these investments would be counterproductive to state healthcare goals.

## Expected Approach

**Administrative Alignment with Federal Requirements**

Oklahoma will implement federal work requirements by December 2026 despite the constitutional tension. The state lacks practical alternatives; refusing to implement would risk federal matching funds that represent 90% of expansion program costs.

The Oklahoma Health Care Authority estimated that approximately 126,000 working-age expansion adults will be subject to community engagement requirements. This represents roughly half the expansion population, with the remainder qualifying for exemptions including AI/AN status, age, pregnancy, disability, or other protected categories.

OHCA has indicated the state faces approximately $30 million in additional administrative costs for implementation. However, the agency also noted that reduced enrollment could offset long-term costs, suggesting at least some expectation of coverage losses.

**Managed Care Infrastructure Utilization**

The three SoonerSelect MCOs will likely play significant roles in member outreach, verification processing, and exemption identification. Each plan has existing member engagement infrastructure, care management capabilities, and data analytics that could support work requirement compliance systems.

Oklahoma Complete Health has already implemented SDOH referral programs (over 11,000 referrals in 2024) and member reward systems that demonstrate capacity for member engagement at scale. These capabilities could be redirected toward work requirement compliance support.

**Timeline**

- 2025: Federal regulatory guidance development; state legal analysis of constitutional issues
- Early 2026: System development; tribal consultation; MCO contract modifications
- Mid-2026: Member communications; reporting system activation
- December 2026: Federal work requirement effective date
- 2027 and beyond: Ongoing implementation with potential legal challenges

## Cross-Program Context

**SNAP Employment & Training**

Oklahoma operates SNAP Employment and Training programs through the Oklahoma Employment Security Commission and partner organizations. The infrastructure for workforce development services exists, though capacity varies by region. Whether Oklahoma will establish automatic deemed compliance for SNAP work requirement participants depends on federal regulatory guidance and state implementation choices.

**Tribal Programs**

The 39 federally recognized tribes in Oklahoma operate their own social service programs with varying levels of integration with state systems. The state must develop exemption verification processes that recognize tribal enrollment and IHS eligibility across diverse tribal documentation systems.

**Provider Tax Structure**

Oklahoma utilizes the Supplemental Hospital Offset Payment Program (SHOPP) to tax hospitals and attract additional federal matching funds. The hospital assessment increased to the maximum 4% in 2024. Critical-access hospitals are exempt from the tax but receive enhanced directed payments under SoonerSelect.

Work requirement implementation that reduces enrollment would decrease the revenue base for provider tax programs, potentially affecting the enhanced payments that support rural hospitals.

**Marketplace Infrastructure**

Oklahoma operates through the federal marketplace rather than a state-based exchange. If enhanced ACA premium tax credits expire (as currently scheduled for December 31, 2025), expansion adults who lose Medicaid coverage for work requirement noncompliance would face significantly higher costs to obtain marketplace coverage, potentially leaving them uninsured.
