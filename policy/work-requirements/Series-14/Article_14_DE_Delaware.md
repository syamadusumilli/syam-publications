## Work Requirement History

Delaware has never implemented Medicaid work requirements. The state's approach to healthcare coverage has emphasized expansion rather than conditionality, and no prior administration sought work requirement waivers during either Trump administration.

When other states pursued Section 1115 waivers for community engagement requirements between 2017 and 2020, Delaware remained focused on expanding enrollment and improving care quality through its Diamond State Health Plan managed care infrastructure. The state codified key Affordable Care Act protections into state law in 2019, ensuring continuation of consumer protections regardless of federal policy changes.

This history reflects Delaware's political environment. Democratic governors have held office continuously since 1993. The legislature maintains Democratic majorities in both chambers. The state's small size creates close relationships between policymakers, healthcare providers, and community advocates that have historically favored coverage expansion.

Governor Matt Meyer, who took office in January 2025, campaigned on expanding healthcare access and has been vocal in opposing the One Big Beautiful Bill Act's Medicaid provisions. His administration has characterized work requirements as creating barriers to coverage rather than pathways to employment.

## Current Policy and Waiver Status

**Federal Requirements and State Response**

Under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Delaware must implement work requirements for expansion adults by January 2027. As of late 2025, the state has not submitted a Section 1115 waiver amendment and has signaled intention to implement only what federal law absolutely requires.

Governor Meyer's proposed FY2026 budget includes a $21.9 million federal contingency fund to offset potential federal funding reductions, reflecting uncertainty about implementation costs and coverage impacts. This represents one of the earliest state-level budget responses to OB3 requirements.

The Delaware Healthcare Association has warned that over 50,000 Delawareans could lose Medicaid coverage under OB3 provisions, with more than 30,000 becoming uninsured. Senator Lisa Blunt Rochester has been among the most vocal congressional critics of work requirements, emphasizing that 63% of Delaware Medicaid adults already work and that requirements function as "onerous rules" designed to push people off coverage.

**Political Environment**

Delaware's unified Democratic government creates clear political opposition to work requirements as policy. Governor Meyer has stated that "the health and well-being of Delawareans is my top priority every day" and pledged to protect healthcare access against federal policy changes.

However, state opposition does not exempt Delaware from federal requirements. The state must navigate implementation while minimizing coverage losses, a tension that will define the next 12 months. Unlike larger states that might leverage political leverage with CMS, Delaware's small size limits its negotiating position.

**State Legislative Activity**

The 2024 Protect Medicaid Act established a hospital assessment program unlocking approximately $175 million in new federal Medicaid funding. This investment positions Delaware's Medicaid program with additional resources heading into work requirement implementation, though those resources will not eliminate implementation costs or coverage disruption risks.

No state legislation specifically addressing work requirement implementation has advanced. The administration appears to be awaiting federal guidance before proposing detailed implementation frameworks.

## Defining Characteristics

**Small State Dynamics**

Delaware's defining characteristic for work requirement implementation is scale. With approximately 70,000 expansion adults subject to requirements, Delaware faces a verification challenge roughly 3% the size of New York's and 10% the size of Ohio's. This creates both advantages and constraints.

On the advantage side, Delaware's small population allows for more personalized approaches than massive states can contemplate. The Division of Medicaid and Medical Assistance knows its MCO partners closely. Community-based organizations operate in tight networks. Implementation could theoretically reach most affected individuals through relatively concentrated outreach.

On the constraint side, Delaware lacks the administrative infrastructure that larger states have built. The state operates no county-based Medicaid administration; all eligibility determination runs through the Division of Social Services. Building work verification systems requires technology investment that larger states can spread across more members. The fixed costs of compliance infrastructure hit smaller states proportionally harder.

**Managed Care Structure**

Delaware operates its Medicaid program through the Diamond State Health Plan, a mandatory managed care model established in the 1990s. Three MCOs serve the expansion population: Highmark Health Options (the largest, with over 124,000 total members), AmeriHealth Caritas Delaware, and Delaware First Health (a Centene subsidiary).

This manageable MCO landscape simplifies coordination compared to states with ten or more plans. All three MCOs have experience with work requirement implementation in other states through their parent companies. Highmark has operated in Pennsylvania, AmeriHealth Caritas across multiple mid-Atlantic states, and Centene has managed work requirements in multiple states including Georgia.

The MCOs will likely play central roles in member outreach, verification support, and exemption identification. Delaware's close relationships with its MCO partners could enable more integrated implementation than states where MCO oversight is primarily adversarial.

**Healthcare Provider Concentration**

Four major health systems serve Delaware: ChristianaCare (based in Wilmington, the region's largest non-profit system with over $2.5 billion in revenue), Bayhealth (serving Kent and Sussex Counties), Beebe Healthcare (Sussex County), and TidalHealth Nanticoke (Seaford area). Nemours Children's Health serves pediatric populations.

This concentrated provider landscape means work requirement outreach can reach most affected populations through a limited number of institutional partners. ChristianaCare alone accounts for the majority of hospital capacity in New Castle County. Provider attestation systems could theoretically operate through a handful of institutional relationships rather than thousands of independent practices.

However, Sussex County faces provider shortages that complicate any compliance approach relying on healthcare touchpoints. The region's rapidly aging population already strains available capacity. Adding work requirement verification responsibilities to clinical encounters may face resistance from providers managing existing workload pressures.

**Aging Population Challenge**

Sussex County has become one of the fastest-growing retirement destinations on the East Coast, creating a population substantially older than state averages. Nearly one in four Delawareans is age 60 or older, and that proportion is higher in Sussex County.

For work requirements, this aging trend has mixed implications. The expansion population subject to work requirements is adults 19-64, so retirees moving to Sussex beaches don't directly affect the subject population. However, the aging population strains healthcare infrastructure that must also serve working-age Medicaid members. Beebe Healthcare, the primary Sussex County provider, reports consistent year-over-year growth in service demand that outpaces facility expansion.

The more significant aging impact may be on exemption populations. Medicaid members approaching age 64 often face health limitations that may qualify for exemptions but require documentation processes that older adults with multiple chronic conditions find difficult to navigate. Delaware's 19% rate of Medicaid members with three or more chronic conditions exceeds many state averages.

**Cross-Border Healthcare Patterns**

Delaware's location between Philadelphia and Baltimore creates healthcare utilization patterns that complicate state-based work requirement systems. Many New Castle County residents receive specialty care in Philadelphia. Providers outside Delaware may be less familiar with Delaware-specific verification requirements.

This cross-border pattern creates coordination challenges that purely intrastate systems don't face. A Delaware Medicaid member receiving cancer treatment at Penn Medicine needs the verification system to account for out-of-state provider touchpoints. While Delaware can design systems assuming most care occurs within state boundaries, the reality of regional healthcare markets requires flexibility.

## Expected Implementation Approach

Delaware will almost certainly implement work requirements with maximum emphasis on coverage protection. The political environment, healthcare provider relationships, and small scale all point toward implementation designed to minimize coverage losses rather than aggressively enforce work participation.

**Anticipated Design Elements**

*Broad Exemptions:* The state will likely claim all available exemption categories at maximum breadth. Medical frailty definitions will be expansive. Caregiver exemptions will extend to the maximum allowable scope. Any discretionary exemption the federal framework permits will be adopted.

*Automated Verification:* Given Delaware's manageable scale, investment in administrative data matching may prove cost-effective. Connections to Department of Labor wage records, educational enrollment systems, and SNAP work requirement compliance could enable automatic deemed compliance for many members.

*Semi-Annual Reporting Only:* The state will implement the minimum federal reporting frequency rather than monthly verification. Six-month reporting cycles reduce member burden and administrative costs.

*MCO-Based Outreach:* The three MCOs will likely bear primary responsibility for member education and compliance support. Their existing care management infrastructure can be redirected toward work requirement navigation.

*Provider Partnerships:* Delaware's concentrated provider landscape enables institutional outreach partnerships. ChristianaCare, Bayhealth, and Beebe already serve most affected populations and could integrate compliance messaging into existing patient communication.

**Timeline Uncertainty**

Delaware has not publicly announced implementation timeline or waiver strategy. The state appears to be waiting for federal guidance while building internal capacity. If Delaware submits a waiver in early 2026, CMS negotiation and approval could extend to mid-2026, leaving minimal time for system development before December 2026 deadlines.

The state may calculate that delayed waiver submission creates pressure for federal flexibility. Alternatively, given Delaware's unified Democratic government, the state may hope for federal policy changes that reduce or eliminate the mandate before implementation becomes necessary.

## Cross-Program Context

**SNAP Coordination**

Delaware operates SNAP through the Division of Social Services, the same agency handling Medicaid eligibility. This administrative alignment creates opportunities for cross-program work requirement coordination that fragmented states lack. A member complying with expanded SNAP work requirements (now applying to parents with teens 14 and older) could receive deemed compliance for Medicaid purposes.

However, the overlapping requirements also multiply documentation burdens if not properly coordinated. The state's SNAP Alert system already indicates implementation of new federal work requirements, suggesting administrative attention to cross-program dynamics.

**TANF Integration**

Delaware's Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program includes work requirements for cash assistance recipients. Integration between TANF and Medicaid work verification could reduce burden for families participating in both programs, though the populations overlap only partially.

**Healthcare Infrastructure Investments**

Delaware has applied for up to $1 billion from the OB3 rural health transformation fund, proposing 15 initiatives including medical school development, mobile health units, and expanded school-based health centers. Governor Meyer has described this application as responding to patients who "drive 50 miles just to see a specialist or wait over six months for a primary care appointment."

These investments, if funded, would expand healthcare touchpoints that could support work requirement verification and exemption documentation. However, the rural health fund is administered by CMS at HHS Secretary discretion, creating uncertainty about funding.

**Marketplace Infrastructure**

Delaware operates its health insurance marketplace through the federally facilitated HealthCare.gov platform with state-specific outreach. The state has designated navigators through Westside Family Healthcare and Quality Insights who could potentially support transitions for members losing Medicaid coverage.

However, enhanced ACA subsidies expired at the end of 2025 under OB3 provisions, potentially making marketplace coverage unaffordable for members losing Medicaid eligibility due to work requirement non-compliance.

## Summary: What Delaware Is Expected to Do

Delaware will implement federal work requirements by January 2027 with maximum resistance within legal constraints. The state's small scale, concentrated provider landscape, and three-MCO managed care structure provide implementation advantages that larger states lack. However, the same small scale means fixed implementation costs hit proportionally harder, and the state lacks the administrative infrastructure that large states have built over decades.

The critical question for Delaware is whether its advantages of scale, coordination, and political will can translate into operational systems within 12 months. The state's unified Democratic government will not embrace work requirements as policy, but it must build compliance infrastructure regardless. Whether that infrastructure protects coverage or becomes another barrier depends on execution quality and federal flexibility in waiver negotiations.

Delaware's outcome matters as a test case for small-state implementation. If a small, well-coordinated state with concentrated healthcare providers and supportive political leadership cannot implement work requirements without significant coverage loss, that signals challenges for states with greater scale but less favorable conditions.
