**Series 14: State Implementation of Work Requirements**

**Word Count Target:** 2,500-3,000 words

## State Profile

**Demographics**

South Carolina, like Tennessee, never accepted Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. The state has no expansion adult population subject to federal work requirements under OB3. Yet South Carolina is actively pursuing Section 1115 waiver authority to implement work requirements for its traditional Medicaid population, following Tennessee's lead in seeking to condition benefits for populations the federal mandate does not reach.

- Traditional Medicaid population: approximately 1.2 million (children, pregnant women, elderly, disabled)
- Adults in coverage gap: approximately 150,000-180,000
- Coverage gap adults have no Medicaid coverage and would not be subject to work requirements
- Parents and caretaker relatives on traditional Medicaid: target population for state waiver
- If South Carolina expanded: estimated 250,000-300,000 adults would gain coverage
- State uninsured rate: approximately 11%, among highest nationally

**Geographic Characteristics**

- 46 counties ranging from coastal resort economies to deeply impoverished rural interior
- Charleston metro: approximately 15% of state population, tourism and healthcare economy
- Columbia metro (Richland, Lexington counties): approximately 15%, state government and university
- Greenville-Spartanburg metro: approximately 18%, manufacturing hub, BMW plant
- Pee Dee region (northeastern interior): severe rural poverty, agricultural economy
- Lowcountry rural areas: persistent poverty, limited healthcare infrastructure
- Approximately 33% of population lives in rural areas

**Special Population Concentrations**

- Large Black population: approximately 27% of state population, concentrated in rural Midlands and Pee Dee
- Gullah Geechee communities along coast with distinct cultural heritage
- Agricultural workforce: tobacco declining, cotton, poultry, nursery crops
- Tourism workforce concentrated on coast (Myrtle Beach, Charleston, Hilton Head)
- Military population significant: Fort Jackson, Shaw Air Force Base, Parris Island, Charleston Naval Complex
- Moderate substance use disorder prevalence; opioid impact growing
- Maternal mortality rate among highest nationally; racial disparities severe

**Economic Context**

- State unemployment rate: approximately 3.5-4.0%
- Major industries: manufacturing (automotive, aerospace), tourism, agriculture, healthcare
- BMW Spartanburg plant largest employer; supplier network throughout Upstate
- Volvo plant in Charleston expanding
- Hospitality industry dominant on coast; seasonal employment patterns
- State minimum wage follows federal floor ($7.25)
- Significant economic disparity between prosperous Upstate/coast and struggling rural interior
- Right-to-work state; union density among lowest nationally

## The Non-Expansion Context

**The Coverage Gap Crisis**

South Carolina's coverage gap is proportionally larger and more consequential than most states. Approximately 150,000-180,000 South Carolinians earn too much for traditional Medicaid (which covers very few non-disabled adults) but too little to qualify for marketplace subsidies.

The coverage gap population characteristics:

*Working Poor:* The majority of coverage gap adults work. They hold jobs that don't provide health insurance in industries like retail, food service, agriculture, and hospitality. Work requirements would apply to a population already working.

*Racial Concentration:* Black South Carolinians are disproportionately represented in the coverage gap due to employment patterns in industries with low insurance coverage rates and concentration in rural areas with limited employment options.

*Geographic Distribution:* Rural interior counties have higher coverage gap populations relative to their total population. The Pee Dee region and rural Midlands are particularly affected.

*Health Consequences:* Without coverage, coverage gap adults delay care, use emergency departments for primary care needs, and experience worse health outcomes. South Carolina's poor health rankings reflect decades of coverage gaps.

**Why South Carolina Has Not Expanded**

South Carolina's refusal to expand Medicaid reflects political, ideological, and fiscal factors:

*Political Opposition:* Republican governors and legislatures have consistently opposed expansion. Governor Henry McMaster has called expansion "a disaster" and rejected federal funding that would cover 90% of costs.

*Ideological Resistance:* Expansion opponents argue that Medicaid dependency discourages work and self-sufficiency. This argument applies to expansion populations that national research shows are predominantly working.

*Fiscal Concerns:* Despite 90% federal matching, the 10% state share for expansion populations exceeds current state Medicaid spending growth. Rural hospital advocates argue expansion would save money by reducing uncompensated care, but these savings accrue to hospitals, not the state budget.

*Political Salience:* Opposition to "Obamacare" remains politically advantageous in South Carolina Republican primaries. Expansion would provide a political attack vector.

**Comparison with Tennessee**

South Carolina and Tennessee share non-expansion status but differ in approach:

*Block Grant Pursuit:* Tennessee has aggressively pursued block grant restructuring with work requirements for traditional populations. South Carolina has not pursued this path, maintaining traditional Medicaid structure without seeking to extend conditionality.

*Waiver Activity:* Tennessee's TennCare III represents active policy innovation within non-expansion. South Carolina has been more passive, simply declining expansion rather than restructuring existing programs.

*Political Environment:* Both states have Republican governance, but Tennessee's approach is more ideologically driven toward program transformation. South Carolina's approach is defensive maintenance of status quo.

## Work Requirement Waiver Pursuit

**2025 Section 1115 Waiver Application**

South Carolina submitted a Section 1115 waiver amendment in 2025 seeking authority to implement work requirements for traditional Medicaid populations. Like Tennessee's TennCare III proposal, South Carolina's waiver extends work requirements beyond what federal law mandates to populations the state already covers.

The waiver application targets:

*Parents and Caretaker Relatives:* Adults receiving Medicaid based on having dependent children would face community engagement requirements. This population is already working at high rates but in jobs without health coverage.

*Transitional Medical Assistance Recipients:* Adults maintaining Medicaid coverage during transition from TANF would face requirements to demonstrate work or work-related activities.

*Other Non-Disabled Adults:* Limited categories of non-disabled adults currently covered under state plan amendments would be subject to requirements.

**Design Elements**

South Carolina's waiver proposal includes:

*Hour Requirements:* 80 hours monthly of qualifying activities including employment, job training, education, job search, community service, and caregiving.

*TANF Alignment:* The proposal explicitly aligns Medicaid work requirements with existing TANF work requirements, creating unified conditionality across cash and medical assistance.

*Verification Through DSS:* The Department of Social Services, which administers both TANF and Medicaid eligibility, would handle verification through existing systems.

*Limited Exemptions:* The proposal includes standard exemptions (pregnancy, disability, caregiving for disabled dependents) but does not expand exemptions beyond federal minimums.

*Enforcement Model:* Following the TANF precedent, South Carolina proposes relatively strict enforcement with benefit reduction or suspension for non-compliance.

**Rationale**

State officials have framed the waiver as promoting self-sufficiency and program integrity. The argument parallels Tennessee's: if work requirements are appropriate for expansion populations under federal law, they should be appropriate for traditional populations under state waiver authority.

Critics note that parents and caretaker relatives on traditional Medicaid are already working. Research consistently shows this population has high employment rates; they qualify for Medicaid because their jobs don't provide coverage, not because they don't work. Work requirements would add documentation burden to an already-employed population.

## Defining Characteristics

**TANF-Medicaid Alignment Strategy**

South Carolina's defining characteristic is the explicit alignment of Medicaid work requirements with existing TANF work requirements. Rather than building new infrastructure, the state proposes leveraging the Department of Social Services systems already tracking TANF work participation.

This alignment strategy offers administrative efficiency but also imports TANF's enforcement culture into Medicaid:

*Unified Verification:* DSS eligibility workers already track work requirements for TANF recipients. Adding Medicaid verification to existing workflows reduces administrative duplication.

*Shared Exemption Determinations:* Exemptions documented for TANF purposes could apply to Medicaid, reducing duplicate documentation burden.

*Integrated Consequences:* Non-compliance with work requirements could affect both cash and medical assistance, creating compounding consequences for families.

*TANF Culture Transfer:* South Carolina's TANF program emphasizes enforcement over support. Sanction rates are high; support services are limited. This culture would transfer to Medicaid work requirements.

**The Rural Hospital Crisis**

South Carolina's rural hospital crisis illustrates the consequences of non-expansion. Multiple rural hospitals have closed or face closure. Remaining hospitals operate on thin margins with high uncompensated care burdens.

The connection to work requirements:

*Coverage Gap Effect:* Coverage gap adults use emergency departments for care they cannot afford, generating uncompensated care that destabilizes hospitals.

*Expansion Alternative:* If South Carolina expanded, hospitals would see uncompensated care decline as previously uninsured patients gained Medicaid. Hospital systems have lobbied for expansion as financial stabilization.

*Work Requirement Interaction:* If expansion occurred with strict work requirements causing coverage losses, the hospital financial benefit would be reduced. High coverage loss rates would maintain uncompensated care burdens.

The South Carolina Hospital Association has supported expansion but has not publicly addressed how work requirements would affect the coverage gains they seek.

**Racial Health Disparities**

South Carolina has among the worst racial health disparities nationally. Black maternal mortality rates are three to four times white rates. Black infant mortality exceeds white infant mortality by similar ratios. Life expectancy gaps between Black and white South Carolinians exceed national averages.

Non-expansion perpetuates these disparities by leaving Black South Carolinians disproportionately in the coverage gap. Work requirements, if expansion occurred, would add additional barriers that research suggests fall more heavily on Black populations.

The intersection of race, geography, and coverage creates compounding disadvantage:
- Black population concentrated in rural areas
- Rural areas have fewer employment opportunities
- Employment available is more likely to lack health coverage
- Coverage gap leaves people without insurance
- Uninsured status produces worse health outcomes
- Worse health reduces work capacity
- Reduced work capacity would create work requirement compliance challenges

**Military Population Considerations**

South Carolina's significant military presence creates a population largely exempt from Medicaid coverage gap issues. Active-duty military receive TRICARE. Veterans may access VA healthcare. Military retirees have coverage options.

However, military-adjacent populations face coverage challenges:
- Family members of lower-enlisted personnel may qualify for Medicaid
- Veterans not enrolled in VA care may fall into coverage gap
- Military retirees below Medicare age may have coverage gaps
- Civilian employees of military installations may lack employer coverage

If expansion occurred, military-adjacent populations would be subject to work requirements. Their circumstances differ from civilian populations in ways that might affect compliance.

**Tourism Economy Seasonality**

South Carolina's coastal tourism economy creates seasonal employment patterns similar to agricultural seasonality:

*Peak Season (May-September):* Myrtle Beach, Charleston, Hilton Head employ thousands in hospitality positions. Workers may exceed 40 hours weekly during peak season.

*Off-Season (October-April):* Employment drops dramatically. Workers may have zero hours or minimal hours during winter months.

Monthly work requirements poorly match these patterns. A worker employed 60 hours weekly in July and 10 hours weekly in January would show inconsistent compliance despite legitimate seasonal employment. Annualized calculations (like Iowa proposes for agriculture) would better accommodate coastal tourism workers.

## Expected Policy Posture

**Anticipated Approach: TANF-Style Enforcement**

South Carolina's waiver pursuit indicates aggressive implementation intent. The TANF alignment strategy suggests the state will apply its existing enforcement-heavy approach to Medicaid work requirements.

Expected characteristics:

*Strict Verification:* Monthly or quarterly reporting requirements with documentation demands similar to TANF.

*Limited Support Services:* Minimal investment in workforce development or navigation support, consistent with TANF approach.

*High Sanction Rates:* Willingness to impose consequences for non-compliance at rates similar to TANF sanctions.

*Standard Exemptions Only:* Federal minimum exemptions without expansion for rural populations or other circumstantial accommodations.

**Timeline**

- 2025: Waiver application submitted and under CMS review
- Late 2025/Early 2026: Potential CMS approval
- 2026: Implementation if approved
- December 2026: Federal work requirement deadline (not applicable to South Carolina absent expansion, but state waiver would proceed independently)

**Key Uncertainties**

*CMS Approval:* Whether CMS will approve work requirements for traditional Medicaid populations that federal law doesn't mandate remains uncertain. Tennessee's TennCare III provides precedent, but each waiver faces independent review.

*Legal Challenges:* Advocacy organizations may challenge the waiver as exceeding Medicaid's statutory purpose, similar to challenges that halted earlier waivers.

*Traditional Population Outcomes:* Parents and caretaker relatives have different characteristics than expansion populations. Whether work requirements function similarly for this population is untested.

*Rural Implementation:* Whether South Carolina can enforce requirements in Pee Dee and rural Midlands regions where employment is limited will test the waiver's practical viability.

**Comparison with Tennessee**

South Carolina follows Tennessee's lead in pursuing work requirements for traditional populations, but with differences:

*Less Ambitious Restructuring:* Tennessee seeks block grant authority fundamentally restructuring Medicaid financing. South Carolina pursues work requirements within traditional Medicaid structure.

*TANF Integration:* South Carolina emphasizes TANF alignment more explicitly than Tennessee, leveraging existing DSS infrastructure.

*Smaller Affected Population:* South Carolina's traditional adult Medicaid population is smaller than Tennessee's, making implementation more manageable but also reducing policy significance.

## Summary: What South Carolina Is Pursuing

South Carolina is actively pursuing Section 1115 waiver authority to implement work requirements for traditional Medicaid populations, following Tennessee's lead in extending conditionality beyond what federal law mandates. The state's approach emphasizes TANF alignment, leveraging existing Department of Social Services infrastructure and importing TANF's enforcement-heavy culture into Medicaid.

The target population differs from expansion states: parents and caretaker relatives already on Medicaid, not newly covered expansion adults. Research shows this population already works at high rates; they qualify for Medicaid because their jobs lack coverage, not because they don't work. Work requirements would add documentation burden without addressing the underlying coverage-employment disconnect.

South Carolina's TANF precedent suggests aggressive enforcement: high sanction rates, limited support services, and consequences that fall disproportionately on Black recipients. If the Medicaid waiver is approved and implemented, similar patterns would likely emerge.

The rural challenge remains. The Pee Dee region and rural Midlands face circumstances similar to Appalachian Kentucky: limited employment, transportation barriers, healthcare access gaps. Requiring work documentation in communities with few jobs tests whether policy design acknowledges economic reality.

South Carolina's waiver pursuit, alongside Tennessee's TennCare III, represents the frontier of work requirement policy: extending conditionality to populations federal law doesn't reach, in states that rejected the expansion that would trigger federal mandates. Whether CMS approves these waivers determines whether work requirements remain tied to expansion or become a broader restructuring of Medicaid eligibility philosophy.

## Cross-Program Context

**TANF-Medicaid Integration**

South Carolina's waiver explicitly integrates Medicaid work requirements with TANF. The Department of Social Services administers both programs, creating unified tracking and verification. Members subject to TANF work requirements would face aligned Medicaid requirements, with non-compliance potentially affecting both benefits.

**SNAP Work Requirements**

South Carolina operates SNAP ABAWD requirements through DSS. The waiver could extend integration to SNAP, creating triple-program work requirement alignment. Whether this reduces burden through unified verification or compounds consequences through multiple jeopardy depends on implementation design.

**No Expansion Population**

The fundamental context is that South Carolina has no expansion population. The state's waiver applies to traditional Medicaid populations that federal work requirements don't reach. This represents policy choice beyond federal mandate.

**Hospital System Dynamics**

South Carolina hospital systems face uncompensated care burdens from the coverage gap population. Work requirements for traditional Medicaid populations would not address this burden; only expansion would. Hospital advocacy has focused on expansion rather than work requirements.

**Marketplace Limitations**

Coverage gap adults cannot access marketplace subsidies because their income falls below 100% FPL. The marketplace provides no alternative for this population. Work requirements for traditional Medicaid populations don't affect coverage gap adults who have no coverage to condition.
