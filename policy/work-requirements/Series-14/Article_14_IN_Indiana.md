## Work Requirement History

Indiana has the most extensive work requirement policy development history of any expansion state, though it never fully implemented the requirements it designed. This heritage shapes current approaches.

**Gateway to Work: The 2017 Design**

Indiana submitted its Gateway to Work waiver amendment in July 2017, proposing community engagement requirements for HIP expansion adults. CMS approved the amendment in February 2018, making Indiana one of the first states to receive work requirement authorization.

The Gateway to Work design reflected lessons from Indiana's HIP 2.0 experience with conditionality:

*Graduated Implementation:* Rather than applying requirements to all expansion adults immediately, Gateway to Work phased in by age group: ages 40-59 first, then 20-39. This acknowledged that older adults might face different compliance challenges than younger adults.

*Multiple Qualifying Activities:* The program recognized employment, job search, education, job training, volunteering, and caregiving as qualifying activities. The 20-hour weekly (80 hours monthly) threshold aligned with federal standards.

*Referral Pathway:* Members not meeting requirements would be referred to workforce development services before facing consequences. This "support before sanction" approach distinguished Indiana from Arkansas's immediate enforcement model.

*Exemption Categories:* Disability, pregnancy, caregiver status, student status, and participation in substance use disorder treatment provided exemption pathways.

**Implementation Halt**

Gateway to Work was scheduled to begin January 2019. However, the federal court decisions vacating Arkansas and Kentucky waivers in March 2019 created legal uncertainty. Indiana paused implementation pending appellate resolution.

The COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 triggered the continuous enrollment requirement, and Gateway to Work remained suspended. Indiana never reached the enforcement phase, so no outcome data exists on coverage loss rates or employment effects.

**HIP 2.0 and POWER Accounts: Alternative Conditionality**

While Gateway to Work never launched, Indiana has operated conditionality requirements through a different mechanism since 2015. The Healthy Indiana Plan 2.0 includes POWER (Personal Wellness and Responsibility) accounts requiring monthly contributions from members.

POWER account structure:

- Members earning above poverty contribute $1-$27 monthly depending on income
- Contributions go to health savings accounts used for cost-sharing
- Non-payment results in coverage consequences: members above poverty face lockout; members below poverty shift to State Plan coverage with different benefit structure
- Preventive care incentives encourage wellness visits

This structure means Indiana has experience operating conditionality requirements, tracking member compliance, and managing non-compliance consequences. The administrative infrastructure exists even though Gateway to Work specifically did not launch.

**Lessons from POWER Accounts**

Indiana's POWER account experience offers insights relevant to work requirement implementation:

*Collection Rates:* Approximately 80-85% of members required to contribute make payments. The 15-20% non-payment rate suggests that even simple monthly requirements create compliance challenges for some members.

*Lockout Effects:* Members locked out for non-payment face coverage gaps. Research documented that lockouts occurred disproportionately among members with chronic conditions, lower incomes, and less stable circumstances.

*Administrative Burden:* Managing monthly contributions, tracking payments, processing lockouts and reinstatements creates significant administrative workload. Work requirement verification would add substantial additional burden.

*Churn:* Members cycle on and off coverage as circumstances change. POWER account compliance interacts with income changes, creating complex eligibility patterns.

## Current Policy and Waiver Status

**2025 Waiver Renewal**

Indiana's HIP 2.0 waiver required renewal in 2025. The state submitted renewal application including reactivation of Gateway to Work provisions. CMS review is ongoing as of late 2025.

The renewed Gateway to Work proposal incorporates modifications from the 2018 design:

*Verification Approach:* Indiana proposes hybrid verification combining administrative data matching (unemployment insurance wage data, education enrollment records, workforce development participation) with member self-attestation for activities not captured in administrative systems.

*Reporting Frequency:* Monthly reporting remains in the proposal, though the state indicates flexibility to move to quarterly reporting if monthly proves administratively burdensome.

*Integration with POWER:* Work requirement status and POWER account status would be tracked through unified member accounts, reducing administrative duplication but potentially compounding consequences for members struggling with multiple requirements.

*Workforce Development Integration:* The renewed proposal emphasizes connection to Indiana's workforce development system (WorkOne centers) for members needing employment support.

**Legislative Context**

Indiana's Republican-controlled legislature and Republican governor strongly support work requirements conceptually. No significant legislative opposition exists to Gateway to Work implementation. The question is not whether Indiana will implement but how aggressively.

State legislation enacted in 2023 directed the Family and Social Services Administration to pursue Gateway to Work implementation aligned with federal timelines. The legislature appropriated funding for administrative systems and workforce development coordination.

**Administrative Preparation**

The Indiana Family and Social Services Administration (FSSA) has been preparing for implementation since federal work requirements became certain:

- System modifications to track work requirement status alongside POWER account status
- Training curricula for eligibility workers on verification procedures
- Contracts with WorkOne workforce development centers for member referrals
- MCO contract modifications incorporating work requirement support functions
- Appeals process development aligned with existing HIP 2.0 appeals infrastructure

## Defining Characteristics

**The POWER Account Heritage**

Indiana's defining characteristic is its experience operating conditionality requirements through POWER accounts. While not work requirements specifically, POWER accounts established that Indiana can track member compliance with monthly requirements, manage non-compliance consequences, and operate administrative systems for conditioned benefits.

This heritage cuts both ways. On one hand, Indiana has infrastructure and experience other states lack. On the other hand, the POWER account experience documented that even simple monthly requirements produce 15-20% non-compliance rates, with consequences falling disproportionately on members with chronic conditions and unstable circumstances.

Adding work requirements to POWER account requirements compounds member burden. A HIP member must pay monthly contributions, maintain qualifying work activities, and report both to maintain coverage. The interaction between these requirements creates multiple potential failure points.

**Manufacturing Volatility**

Indiana's manufacturing-heavy economy creates distinctive work requirement challenges. Manufacturing employment in Indiana is both substantial and volatile:

*RV Industry Cycles:* Elkhart County, the RV manufacturing capital, experiences dramatic employment swings with economic cycles. During the 2008-2009 recession, Elkhart County unemployment exceeded 20%. During boom periods, unemployment drops below 3%. Members employed in RV manufacturing may work 60+ hours weekly during peak demand and zero hours during downturns.

*Automotive Supplier Volatility:* Indiana hosts numerous automotive suppliers whose production tracks vehicle demand. Supplier employment is increasingly through temporary staffing agencies, creating documentation challenges (multiple employers, variable hours, non-traditional pay structures).

*Shift Work Patterns:* Manufacturing commonly operates multiple shifts with rotating schedules. A member working second shift one month and third shift the next may have difficulty documenting consistent hours or accessing services during business hours.

*Cyclical Layoffs:* Seasonal layoffs, model changeovers, and demand fluctuations create periods of unemployment interspersed with periods of full-time work. Monthly hour requirements may miss members who work 160 hours one month and zero the next.

**The Three Indianas**

Implementation must address three distinct contexts:

*Urban Indiana:* Indianapolis, Fort Wayne, and other cities have diverse employment markets, public transportation (limited but present), and service infrastructure. Members can access workforce development, verification offices, and qualifying activities within reasonable distance. Automation and data matching should work for most members in formal employment.

*Manufacturing Belt:* Northwestern Indiana (Gary, Hammond) and central Indiana manufacturing communities face legacy industrial decline, environmental contamination, elevated poverty, and health challenges. Employment exists but is increasingly precarious. The steel industry workforce in Lake County faces circumstances similar to Appalachian coal communities.

*Rural Southern Indiana:* Counties bordering Kentucky share Appalachian characteristics: limited employment, transportation barriers, health challenges, and opioid epidemic impact. What works in Indianapolis fails in Crawford County.

**Amish Population Considerations**

Indiana's approximately 60,000 Amish residents present unique verification challenges. The Amish:

- Generally oppose participation in government programs on religious grounds
- May not have Social Security numbers or appear in administrative databases
- Operate businesses and employment outside formal economy
- Have religious exemptions from certain government requirements

Most Amish do not participate in Medicaid, but those who do face verification challenges if their employment and activities occur outside systems generating administrative data. Indiana will need accommodation pathways for this population.

**MCO Infrastructure**

Indiana contracts with multiple MCOs for HIP coverage: Anthem, CareSource, MDwise, and Managed Health Services (Centene). These MCOs have operated under HIP 2.0 requirements including POWER account coordination, providing experience with conditionality administration.

The state's approach integrates work requirement support into MCO responsibilities:

- Care coordinators will identify members at compliance risk
- MCOs will facilitate referrals to WorkOne centers
- POWER account and work requirement status will be coordinated
- MCO performance metrics will incorporate compliance outcomes

## Expected Policy Posture and Timeline

**Anticipated Approach: Active Enforcement**

Indiana's implementation philosophy leans toward active enforcement rather than zero-friction accommodation. The state's POWER account experience demonstrates willingness to impose consequences for non-compliance. Gateway to Work design included referral pathways before sanctions, but the structure anticipated enforcement as the ultimate mechanism.

Several factors suggest Indiana will pursue active verification:

*Political Environment:* Republican governance supports work requirements as policy priority. No political pressure toward minimizing requirements exists.

*Administrative Heritage:* POWER account operations demonstrate capacity and willingness to manage conditionality. The state has practiced tracking compliance and imposing consequences.

*Workforce Development Investment:* Indiana has invested in WorkOne integration, suggesting genuine interest in employment outcomes rather than purely coverage maintenance.

*Documentation Culture:* HIP 2.0 already requires ongoing member engagement (POWER contributions). Adding work verification extends existing documentation expectations.

**Timeline**

- 2025: Waiver renewal submitted and under CMS review
- Late 2025: CMS approval anticipated
- Early 2026: System finalization; MCO contract modifications; worker training
- Mid-2026: Pilot implementation
- December 2026: Full implementation aligned with federal deadline

**Key Uncertainties**

*POWER Account Interaction:* How work requirements and POWER accounts interact for members struggling with either or both requirements is not fully specified. Whether non-compliance with one affects the other creates compounding risk.

*Manufacturing Volatility Accommodation:* How Indiana will treat members with legitimately variable hours due to manufacturing cycles is unclear. Monthly requirements may create compliance failures for members working full-time overall but not every month.

*Rural Southern Indiana:* Whether the state will accommodate circumstances in Appalachian-adjacent counties or apply uniform requirements regardless of local employment opportunity is not specified.

*Reporting Frequency:* The proposal includes monthly reporting, which other states found unsustainable. Whether Indiana will reduce to quarterly if monthly creates administrative burden remains uncertain.

## Summary: What Indiana Is Expected to Do

Indiana will implement work requirements building on its Gateway to Work design and POWER account administrative experience. The state has infrastructure other states lack: experience tracking monthly member compliance, managing non-compliance consequences, and operating conditionality requirements. This heritage suggests Indiana will pursue active enforcement rather than zero-friction accommodation.

The interaction between work requirements and POWER accounts creates compounding compliance burden. Members must pay monthly contributions, maintain qualifying activities, and document both. The 15-20% POWER account non-payment rate suggests similar or higher non-compliance rates for work requirements, with consequences potentially falling on members already struggling with POWER payments.

Manufacturing volatility creates distinctive challenges. Members in RV production, automotive supply, and other cyclical industries may work 160 hours one month and zero the next. Monthly hour requirements poorly match employment patterns in industries that dominate Indiana's economy.

Indiana's experience will test whether conditionality requirements that work for premium contributions translate to work documentation. The administrative systems exist; whether they can handle the different verification challenges of work hours versus payment receipt will determine outcomes.

## Cross-Program Context

**SNAP E&T Alignment**

Indiana operates SNAP Employment & Training for overlapping populations. The state's waiver proposes automatic deemed compliance: members meeting SNAP work requirements are compliant for Medicaid. This reduces duplicative burden and leverages existing verification.

**TANF Work Requirements**

Indiana's TANF program includes work requirements administered by county offices. Infrastructure and workforce development partnerships from TANF support Medicaid implementation, though TANF serves a different population.

**WorkOne Integration**

Indiana's workforce development system (WorkOne) is explicitly integrated into Gateway to Work design. Participation in WorkOne programs counts as qualifying activity. Members not meeting requirements receive referrals to WorkOne before facing consequences. This integration distinguishes Indiana's "support before sanction" approach from pure enforcement models.

**Provider Considerations**

Major healthcare systems including Indiana University Health, Community Health Network, and Franciscan Health serve HIP members. These systems have interest in coverage maintenance to reduce uncompensated care. Whether provider advocacy will moderate enforcement approach is uncertain.

**Marketplace Infrastructure**

Indiana operates on the federally facilitated marketplace. Members losing HIP coverage may transition to marketplace plans with premium tax credits depending on income. The state-facilitated enrollment assistance through HIP could potentially support marketplace transitions, reducing coverage gap duration.
