## Work Requirement History

North Dakota has no prior history of Medicaid work requirements. Unlike states such as Georgia, Arkansas, or Michigan that pursued work requirement waivers during the 2018 to 2020 period, North Dakota did not seek Section 1115 waiver authority to impose community engagement requirements on expansion adults.

The state expanded Medicaid in 2014 following passage of Ballot Measure 2 by the state legislature. Unlike many expansion states where Medicaid expansion faced political opposition, North Dakota's Republican-controlled legislature authorized expansion with minimal controversy. Governor Jack Dalrymple, a Republican, signed the legislation. The state has reauthorized expansion through successive legislative sessions, most recently extending the program through 2027.

North Dakota's decision not to pursue work requirements during the 2018 waiver wave likely reflected several factors. The state's exceptionally low unemployment rate meant most expansion adults were already working. The administrative infrastructure to build a work verification system would have represented significant investment for a small population. The state's Medicaid program was functioning effectively without adding complexity.

When federal work requirements were enacted through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in July 2025, North Dakota thus faces implementation without the benefit of prior experience or existing waiver infrastructure. However, the state also avoids the complications of reconciling federal requirements with pre-existing state-specific work requirement designs.

## Current Policy and Waiver Status

**State Posture**

Governor Kelly Armstrong, who took office in December 2024, has explicitly endorsed federal work requirements. In July 2025, Armstrong stated: "If you're able to work and you're on government assistance, you should have to work." This positions North Dakota as an enforcement-oriented state that will implement work requirements as designed rather than seeking maximum exemptions.

The North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services anticipates that federal work requirements will affect only 3 to 5 percent of the state's Medicaid population. Sarah Aker, executive director of the Medical Services Division, has emphasized that when federal exemptions are fully applied (pregnant women, medically frail individuals, tribal members, parents with children under 14, those with substance use or mental health conditions), the affected population shrinks substantially.

**Administrative Approach**

North Dakota HHS has announced plans to re-use existing systems to track work requirements rather than building new infrastructure. The state views this approach as consistent with its relatively small expansion population and existing data integration capabilities.

The state has created a "Stay Enrolled" webpage providing public information about upcoming Medicaid changes including work requirements. Communications emphasize that:

- Work requirements only apply to Medicaid expansion adults, not traditional Medicaid populations
- Six-month redetermination requirements only apply to expansion adults
- Many exemptions will protect people from work requirements even if they cannot work 80 hours monthly

**Timeline**

- December 31, 2026: Federal work requirement effective date
- July 2027: First six-month eligibility renewal under new requirements
- January 2027: Retroactive coverage reduced to one month for expansion enrollees

## Defining Characteristics

**The Prepared State**

North Dakota's approach to work requirements reflects a state that views itself as well-positioned to implement federal mandates with minimal disruption. State officials have repeatedly characterized North Dakota's situation as distinct from states likely to experience significant coverage losses. This confidence rests on several factors.

First, high baseline employment rates among expansion adults means most enrollees will satisfy work requirements through existing employment. With 72% of expansion adults already working and the state experiencing severe labor shortages, employment opportunities exist for those seeking work. State officials argue that work requirements will affect a genuinely small population of able-bodied adults who are neither working nor exempt.

Second, the small absolute size of the expansion population (approximately 23,000) means implementation complexity remains manageable. North Dakota does not face the scale challenges confronting states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, or Michigan with hundreds of thousands of expansion enrollees. A 5% coverage loss rate in North Dakota translates to approximately 1,000 to 1,500 people, while the same rate in a large state would affect tens of thousands.

Third, existing relationships between state agencies and the single MCO managing expansion coverage (Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Dakota) simplify coordination. The state can work with one partner rather than multiple competing MCOs with varying capabilities and incentives.

**The Single-MCO Model**

Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Dakota serves as the sole managed care organization for Medicaid expansion adults. The state awarded this contract in 2022, transitioning from previous managed care arrangements with Sanford Health Plan. This single-MCO structure has implications for work requirement implementation.

BCBSND maintains member services infrastructure and can serve as a communication channel for work requirement information. The MCO has financial incentive to maintain enrollment by helping members achieve compliance. Unlike states with multiple MCOs competing for members, BCBSND faces no risk of losing enrollees to competitors. This reduces gaming behavior but also eliminates competitive pressure to invest in member navigation services.

The single-MCO model also creates single points of failure. If BCBSND's member communication or navigation support proves inadequate, the state lacks alternative capacity. Smaller states often face this challenge: concentration reduces administrative complexity but eliminates redundancy.

**Tribal Populations**

North Dakota's five federally recognized tribes represent significant considerations for work requirement implementation. Federal law exempts tribal members from work requirements, but implementation of this exemption requires coordination mechanisms that North Dakota has not previously needed.

Tribal health delivery in North Dakota occurs through Indian Health Service facilities (two IHS hospitals), tribally operated health programs, and Urban Indian Health programs. The relationship between tribal healthcare delivery and state Medicaid creates layered complexities. Tribal members may be enrolled in Medicaid expansion through the state system while receiving care through IHS or tribal facilities.

The exemption identification process must accurately flag tribal members to prevent inappropriate disenrollment. This requires data sharing between tribal enrollment offices and the state Medicaid agency. Given the concentration of tribal populations on reservations, where verification infrastructure may be limited, the state must consider how tribal members will confirm their exempt status.

Governor Armstrong has engaged with tribal leadership, meeting with Standing Rock Sioux leadership in April 2025 regarding federal funding and economic development issues. Whether this relationship extends to effective work requirement coordination remains to be demonstrated.

**Rural Healthcare Fragility**

North Dakota's healthcare infrastructure faces challenges that work requirements could exacerbate. The state has 52 hospitals, including 36 Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs) serving rural communities. Twelve of 39 rural hospitals are at risk of closing according to the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform. Provider maldistribution means rural areas face chronic shortages while urban centers maintain adequate ratios.

Only six of 53 North Dakota counties have adequate numbers of healthcare workers. The state projects a shortage of 500 physicians by 2040. Frontier areas cannot compete with urban centers for healthcare workers, leaving rural communities perpetually understaffed.

Coverage losses from work requirements would increase uncompensated care at already-stressed rural facilities. Unity Medical Center CEO Alan O'Neil has warned that patients losing coverage "go through the emergency department and are unable to pay, which leads to what the healthcare world calls 'bad debt.'" Bad debt accumulation forces price increases affecting all patients.

The $500 million Rural Health Transformation Program funding (approximately $100 million annually for five years) that North Dakota will receive under OB3 may partially offset coverage loss impacts. Governor Armstrong has positioned this funding as a central element of the state's rural health strategy. However, the funding supports infrastructure and workforce development rather than directly subsidizing uncompensated care from coverage losses.

**Oil Economy Dynamics**

The Bakken Formation oil development creates unique workforce patterns affecting work requirement implementation. The four core oil and gas producing counties (Williams, McKenzie, Mountrail, Dunn) experience employment patterns characterized by boom-bust cycles, temporary contract work, high turnover, and out-of-state workers cycling through.

Oil field employment often involves irregular schedules, contract arrangements without traditional employer documentation, and workers who may not maintain North Dakota residency. Someone working in the Bakken might log 80 hours weekly for several months, then experience gaps during price downturns or contract endings.

Work requirement verification in western North Dakota must accommodate these realities. Contract workers may lack the employer letters or pay stubs that stable W-2 employment provides. High turnover means people transition between employment statuses frequently. The oil economy that drives North Dakota's low unemployment rate simultaneously creates verification challenges.

## Expected Approach

**Coverage-Protective or Enforcement-Oriented?**

Governor Armstrong's explicit endorsement of work requirements suggests North Dakota will take an enforcement-oriented approach. The state has not signaled interest in maximizing exemptions, extending good cause exceptions, or building extensive navigation infrastructure to keep people enrolled.

However, the state's small affected population and existing high employment rates may produce coverage-protective outcomes regardless of enforcement orientation. If only 1,000 to 1,500 people face work requirement impacts, the state may experience genuinely minimal coverage losses without needing the extensive mitigation infrastructure larger states require.

The state's characterization that national discussion "overstates" impacts on North Dakota reflects this reality. A policy that devastates coverage in states with large, struggling populations may function adequately in a small, prosperous state with extremely tight labor markets.

**Verification Infrastructure**

North Dakota plans to leverage existing systems rather than building new work verification infrastructure. The state has indicated it will reuse systems currently tracking work requirements for other programs, likely SNAP Employment & Training systems or TANF work participation systems.

This approach carries cost advantages but may not accommodate Medicaid-specific verification needs. SNAP and TANF work tracking serves different populations with different requirements and different exemption categories. Whether these systems can simply be adapted or require significant modification remains unclear.

**Exemption Processing**

The state has a documented approach to medical frailty determinations that may inform work requirement exemption processing. Applicants for medically frail status must answer questionnaires and submit documentation including medical chart notes and treatment plans. State spokesperson Mindy Michaels indicated that more than half of applicants were denied in 2024.

This high denial rate suggests a rigorous verification approach that may carry over to work requirement exemptions. People with genuine medical conditions preventing work may face documentation burdens that some will fail to meet. The gap between actual incapacity and documented incapacity could produce coverage losses among people who legitimately cannot work.

**Timeline Considerations**

- December 31, 2026: Work requirements effective
- July 2027: First six-month redetermination for expansion adults
- Implementation window: 12 months from present

North Dakota's compressed timeline benefits from the state's existing administrative capacity and small population. States building new systems from scratch face greater time pressure than states adapting existing infrastructure.

## Cross-Program Context

**SNAP Employment & Training**

North Dakota operates SNAP E&T programs that could provide deemed compliance pathways for Medicaid work requirements if federal regulations permit. Individuals already meeting SNAP work requirements would not need to separately document compliance for Medicaid.

SNAP ABAWD requirements affect a similar population to Medicaid work requirements. Cross-program coordination could reduce administrative burden for both the state and enrollees. Whether North Dakota pursues this integration or maintains separate tracking systems will affect implementation efficiency.

**TANF Work Requirements**

North Dakota's TANF program includes work requirements administered through the same Human Service Zone offices that handle Medicaid eligibility. Integration possibilities exist but have not been announced.

**Provider Tax Structure**

North Dakota has minimal dependence on provider taxes for Medicaid financing compared to states like New York or California. This limits provider financial engagement in coverage maintenance but also insulates the state from provider tax-related funding complications under OB3 changes.

**Rural Health Transformation Funding**

The $500 million in rural health transformation funding over five years represents significant investment in North Dakota's healthcare infrastructure. The state's application emphasizes workforce development, preventive care, telehealth expansion, and technology integration.

However, this funding addresses healthcare capacity rather than coverage. Rural hospitals benefit from infrastructure investment but still face coverage loss impacts if work requirements disenroll significant populations. The funding offsets some concerns but does not eliminate tension between work requirements and rural healthcare sustainability.

## Summary

North Dakota approaches work requirements from an unusually favorable position. High employment rates, small expansion population, single-MCO administration, and existing system infrastructure create conditions for manageable implementation. State officials project 3 to 5 percent of Medicaid population affected, translating to approximately 1,000 to 1,500 people losing coverage.

The state's enforcement orientation under Governor Armstrong reflects both ideological commitment to work requirements and confidence that implementation will not produce the catastrophic outcomes seen in Arkansas. Whether this confidence proves warranted depends on execution details not yet determined: exemption processing rigor, verification system adequacy, and tribal coordination effectiveness.

North Dakota will not provide a model for larger states facing work requirement implementation. Its advantages are not replicable in states with hundreds of thousands of expansion adults, multiple competing MCOs, weak labor markets, and limited administrative capacity. But for small, prosperous states with similar characteristics, North Dakota's experience will indicate whether work requirements can function without extensive mitigation infrastructure.

The key risk lies in the gap between state confidence and implementation reality. Officials who believe work requirements will affect only 3 to 5 percent of enrollees may not invest adequately in systems and processes that would catch the additional 5 to 10 percent who fall through cracks in verification, exemption processing, and communication. The difference between projected and actual coverage losses will measure whether North Dakota's preparedness matches its self-assessment.
