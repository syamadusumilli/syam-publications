## Work Requirement History

Wisconsin holds a distinctive position in the work requirements landscape: the state received federal approval for Medicaid work requirements in 2018 but never implemented them. This history creates a unique starting point for December 2026 compliance.

**The Walker Administration Waiver**

Governor Scott Walker's administration submitted a Section 1115 waiver request to CMS in June 2017 as part of the 2015-2017 budget bill (Act 55). The waiver proposed "community engagement requirements" for childless adults enrolled in BadgerCare Plus, requiring documentation of 80 hours monthly of work, education, job training, or community service.

CMS approved the waiver in October 2018, making Wisconsin the first non-expansion state to receive work requirement approval. The approval came weeks before the November 2018 gubernatorial election that Walker narrowly lost to Democrat Tony Evers.

**Legislative Lock-In**

Before leaving office, the Walker administration and Republican legislature enacted legislation preventing Governor-elect Evers from withdrawing the waiver without legislative approval. This created a standoff: a Democratic governor opposed to work requirements but legally constrained from canceling them, and a Republican legislature supportive of requirements but lacking the executive branch cooperation needed for implementation.

**COVID-19 Suspension**

Implementation was scheduled to begin in 2020 but was suspended when the COVID-19 public health emergency triggered the continuous enrollment requirement that prohibited states from terminating Medicaid coverage. Wisconsin's work requirements remained in suspended animation.

**Biden Administration Withdrawal**

In December 2021, the Biden administration's CMS formally moved to rescind the waiver approval, concluding that community engagement requirements were "not likely to promote the objectives of the Medicaid statute." The letter noted that work requirements do not help people gain employment but do push people off health insurance coverage.

**The Dormant Infrastructure**

Wisconsin spent years preparing for implementation that never occurred. The Department of Health Services developed verification protocols, exemption processes, and reporting systems. Staff were trained on work requirement administration. This infrastructure was never activated, but the institutional knowledge remains.

The state's experience demonstrates a pattern observed elsewhere: work requirements generate substantial preparation costs regardless of whether coverage losses ultimately occur. Wisconsin invested administrative resources in a program that produced neither the workforce participation gains proponents sought nor the coverage losses opponents feared, because implementation never proceeded far enough to produce either outcome.

## Current Policy and Waiver Status

Wisconsin's situation in late 2025 differs fundamentally from most states. It has not expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act's full expansion terms (to 138% FPL) but covers childless adults up to 100% FPL through a Section 1115 demonstration waiver. This creates an unusual population profile.

**The Non-Expansion Exception**

Wisconsin is the only non-expansion state without a coverage gap. By covering adults up to 100% FPL through BadgerCare Plus and allowing marketplace subsidies for those earning 100-138% FPL, the state created a patchwork system that provides coverage pathways for all low-income residents. However, this approach forgoes billions in enhanced federal matching funds that expansion states receive.

**Current Waiver Status**

The BadgerCare Plus Section 1115 demonstration waiver was extended for five years in October 2024. Current authorized populations include:

- Childless adults with income up to 100% of the federal poverty level
- Transitional medical assistance for those whose income rises above 100% FPL
- Former foster care youth from other states (under age 26)
- Substance use disorder program expansions covering short-term residential services

The waiver does not currently include work requirements, as the Biden administration's withdrawal eliminated that component.

**Legislative Activity**

Governor Evers has included Medicaid expansion in every budget proposal since taking office. The 2025-2027 budget proposal requested full expansion to 138% FPL, which would provide coverage to approximately 95,800 additional Wisconsinites and generate an estimated $1.9 billion in state savings over the biennium.

Republican legislative majorities have consistently rejected expansion. In May 2025, the Joint Committee on Finance voted along party lines to remove expansion from budget consideration. Senate President Mary Felzkowski questioned why Wisconsin would "take people off of private insurance to put them on government insurance."

**OB3 Implications**

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act creates an unusual situation for Wisconsin. As a non-expansion state, Wisconsin faces less exposure to the Act's Medicaid provisions than the 40 states that fully expanded. However, Wisconsin's Section 1115 waiver covering adults to 100% FPL likely qualifies as "minimum essential coverage" subject to the new work requirements.

The Kaiser Family Foundation and other analysts have noted that Section 1115 demonstration populations providing equivalent coverage will be subject to the community engagement mandate. Wisconsin must therefore implement work requirements for its approximately 198,000 childless adults despite not having formally expanded Medicaid.

Senate Democratic estimates suggest approximately 230,000 Wisconsin residents could lose coverage under the new requirements, though this figure may include populations beyond childless adults.

## Defining Characteristics

**The Political Stalemate**

Wisconsin exemplifies the political polarization surrounding Medicaid policy. A Democratic governor has proposed expansion six consecutive times; a Republican legislature has rejected it six consecutive times. This impasse shapes all health coverage decisions.

The state's approach to OB3 work requirements will be determined through this divided government framework. Governor Evers cannot unilaterally design a minimal-enforcement system, nor can the legislature mandate maximum enforcement without executive cooperation. The resulting implementation will likely reflect negotiated compromises or ongoing conflict.

**Administrative Capacity**

Wisconsin operates a sophisticated Medicaid administrative infrastructure through the Department of Health Services. The ACCESS system provides integrated eligibility screening for multiple programs including BadgerCare Plus, FoodShare (SNAP), and other benefits. Organizations trained on ACCESS can submit applications that screen for multiple programs simultaneously.

This cross-program infrastructure could enable coordinated verification across SNAP and Medicaid work requirements, potentially reducing duplication of effort. Whether the state chooses to leverage this capacity depends on policy decisions yet to be made.

**Managed Care Landscape**

Wisconsin contracts with 18 health plans across multiple Medicaid programs. For BadgerCare Plus, participating plans include Children's Community Health Plan, CommunityConnect Health Plan, CompCare, Dean Health Plan, Group Health Cooperative of Eau Claire, Managed Health Services (MHS), Molina Healthcare, Network Health Plan, and UnitedHealthcare.

Most plans are community-operated entities; only MHS (Centene), Molina, and United are nationally based for-profit organizations. This mix of local nonprofit and national commercial plans creates variable capacity for supporting work requirement compliance.

MHS Health Wisconsin, established in Milwaukee in 1984, operates the largest Medicaid managed care operation in the state. The plan's founding mission emphasized serving diverse populations and bridging ethnic and economic gaps, principles that may shape its response to work requirement implementation.

**Geographic Concentration of Vulnerability**

The populations most vulnerable to work requirement compliance barriers concentrate in predictable locations. Milwaukee County, with 17.5% of residents below the poverty line and a poverty rate for children at 23%, contains the state's largest concentration of Medicaid enrollees. The city's population is majority-minority, with Black residents disproportionately represented among those living in poverty.

Northern rural counties face different challenges. Limited public transportation, seasonal employment patterns, sparse broadband coverage, and healthcare provider shortages create verification and documentation barriers distinct from urban contexts. Counties like Menominee, Iron, Adams, Bayfield, and Forest experience the state's highest unemployment rates.

**Tribal Coordination**

Wisconsin's 11 federally recognized tribal nations require specific coordination protocols. Under OB3, tribal members retain certain protections, but implementation complexity increases when state systems must interface with tribal health programs and Indian Health Service facilities.

The Great Lakes Inter-Tribal Council Epidemiology Center has documented health disparities affecting Wisconsin's American Indian population: higher smoking rates (36% vs. 22% statewide), elevated diabetes mortality (3.3 times the white rate), and higher rates of unemployment (44% not employed vs. 32% statewide). These characteristics suggest tribal populations may face elevated compliance barriers despite available exemptions.

## Expected Policy Posture and Timeline

**Implementation Philosophy Uncertainty**

Wisconsin's divided government makes predicting implementation philosophy difficult. Three scenarios emerge:

*Scenario One: Minimal Enforcement.* Governor Evers' administration designs implementation to maximize exemptions, automate verification through data matching, and minimize procedural barriers. Republican legislators object but lack mechanisms to force stricter implementation.

*Scenario Two: Legislative Override.* The Republican legislature passes binding legislation mandating specific enforcement protocols, exemption limitations, or verification requirements. Governor Evers vetoes. The cycle continues through the December 2026 deadline with no clear resolution.

*Scenario Three: Negotiated Middle Ground.* Political actors recognize that some implementation must occur and negotiate a compromise balancing work requirement compliance with access preservation. Neither side achieves its preferred outcome, but a workable system emerges.

The state's history suggests Scenario Two is most likely, with implementation occurring through administrative discretion exercised by DHS under Evers' direction, constrained by whatever legislative requirements can survive veto.

**Verification Approach**

Wisconsin's ACCESS system integration with multiple benefit programs creates opportunities for automated verification that many states lack. If DHS chooses to maximize data matching with unemployment insurance records, SNAP E&T documentation, and other administrative sources, many enrollees could achieve compliance verification without affirmative reporting.

The state's prior work requirement preparation may accelerate implementation. Institutional knowledge from the 2018-2020 period remains within DHS, and verification protocols developed but never deployed could be adapted for OB3 requirements.

**Exemption Decisions**

OB3 provides mandatory exemptions (pregnancy, disability, caregiving for dependents under six or incapacitated household members, full-time students, recent job loss) but allows states to define implementation details. Wisconsin will face decisions about:

- How broadly to interpret "medically frail" determinations
- Whether to extend exemptions to populations facing barriers not explicitly listed (serious mental illness, active substance use disorder treatment, homelessness)
- How to document tribal member status for applicable protections
- Whether to recognize good cause exemptions for verification failures

The Evers administration's demonstrated policy preferences suggest expansive exemption interpretation, though federal guidance may constrain flexibility.

**Timeline**

Wisconsin must implement work requirements by January 1, 2027. Given the compressed timeline and political complications, the state faces several critical milestones:

- Late 2025: Federal guidance clarifies requirements for Section 1115 demonstration populations
- Early 2026: DHS develops implementation plan; legislative engagement determines whether binding legislation emerges
- Mid-2026: System modifications to ACCESS and managed care plan coordination
- Late 2026: Beneficiary notification and outreach
- January 2027: Implementation begins

The state has approximately 14 months from present to achieve operational readiness for a program affecting nearly 200,000 residents.

## Summary: What Wisconsin Is Expected to Do

Wisconsin will implement work requirements for its approximately 198,000 childless adults enrolled in BadgerCare Plus, despite never having formally expanded Medicaid. The state's unique coverage structure, extending eligibility to 100% FPL through Section 1115 waiver authority, brings it within OB3's scope even as it foregoes the enhanced federal matching available to expansion states.

**The Implementation Paradox**

Wisconsin finds itself in a peculiar position: required to implement work requirements the current governor opposes, for a population smaller than full expansion would cover, while incurring administrative costs that expansion would have avoided. The state will spend resources verifying work status for people earning below the poverty level while declining federal funds that would cover people earning up to 138% FPL.

This paradox reflects the politics that prevented expansion for over a decade. Republican legislators who rejected expansion as government overreach will now oversee government verification of whether low-income adults work enough hours to deserve healthcare coverage. Democratic administrators who supported expansion will manage a compliance system designed to condition coverage on documented work activity.

**Likely Approach**

Given the current political configuration, Wisconsin will likely pursue a moderate implementation:

*Data Matching Priority.* DHS will maximize automated verification through existing administrative data sources, minimizing the reporting burden on individual beneficiaries. The ACCESS system's cross-program integration provides infrastructure for this approach.

*Broad Exemption Interpretation.* The Evers administration will interpret exemption categories expansively, using discretion to protect populations facing compliance barriers. Tribal members, individuals in substance use treatment, and those with documented disabilities will receive streamlined exemption processing.

*Managed Care Coordination.* Health plans will be enlisted to support beneficiary compliance through outreach, documentation assistance, and early identification of individuals at disenrollment risk. Whether plans have capacity and incentive to perform these functions effectively remains uncertain.

*Milwaukee Focus.* Given the concentration of vulnerable populations in Milwaukee County, implementation resources and community organization partnerships will disproportionately target the southeastern region.

**Outstanding Questions**

Several factors could alter Wisconsin's trajectory:

*Federal Guidance.* CMS interpretation of how work requirements apply to Section 1115 demonstration populations will determine Wisconsin's actual obligations. If guidance provides flexibility, DHS may have more room to minimize enforcement.

*Legislative Action.* Republican legislators could attempt to mandate stricter implementation through budget provisions or standalone legislation. Whether such efforts would survive gubernatorial veto depends on political calculations.

*2026 Elections.* Wisconsin holds gubernatorial and legislative elections in November 2026, weeks before implementation begins. Electoral outcomes could shift the political environment during the critical implementation period.

*Expansion Reconsideration.* If federal work requirements make the status quo more administratively burdensome while expansion remains available (with its 90% federal match), the political calculus could shift. However, over a decade of consistent Republican opposition suggests this remains unlikely.

Wisconsin will implement work requirements reluctantly, through a divided government that agrees on little except that implementation must occur. The resulting system will reflect this ambivalence: neither the streamlined pathway proponents envision nor the coverage barrier opponents fear, but an administrative structure built through political compromise that satisfies no one completely.

## Cross-Program Context

**SNAP FoodShare Coordination**

Wisconsin operates FoodShare (SNAP) through the same ACCESS system that manages BadgerCare Plus eligibility. Able-Bodied Adults Without Dependents (ABAWD) already face time-limited SNAP benefits with work requirements, creating a population familiar with compliance documentation.

Coordination between SNAP and Medicaid work requirements could reduce duplication. An individual documenting 80 hours monthly for FoodShare could have that verification automatically applied to BadgerCare Plus eligibility. Whether Wisconsin implements such coordination depends on system modifications and policy decisions during the implementation period.

**Provider Tax Dynamics**

Wisconsin historically maintained low hospital provider taxes compared to states like California or New York. The 2025-2027 budget increased the hospital assessment from 1.8% to the federal maximum of 6%, generating approximately $1 billion annually in additional federal matching funds.

This dramatic increase, supported by Republican legislators who had rejected Medicaid expansion, illustrates the state's complex fiscal relationship with federal healthcare funding. Wisconsin will accept provider tax revenue to maintain current Medicaid payments while declining expansion dollars that would extend coverage.

**Marketplace Infrastructure**

Wisconsin uses the federal marketplace (HealthCare.gov) for individual coverage. The structure that allows marketplace subsidies for those earning 100-138% FPL creates a pathway for individuals who lose BadgerCare Plus eligibility due to work requirement noncompliance, provided their income exceeds the poverty level.

For those below 100% FPL who lose coverage, no marketplace subsidy pathway exists. These individuals would join the approximately 250,000 Wisconsin residents currently uninsured, unless they qualify for other coverage sources.

**Hospital System Pressures**

Wisconsin hospitals face substantial uncompensated care costs from uninsured patients. The Wisconsin Hospital Association has supported Medicaid expansion as a means of reducing bad debt. If work requirements cause coverage losses among the childless adult population, hospital systems in Milwaukee and other high-poverty areas will absorb additional uncompensated care costs.

Rural hospitals in northern Wisconsin already face financial pressures from small patient volumes and high uncompensated care. Work requirement coverage losses could accelerate consolidation or closure in vulnerable facilities.
