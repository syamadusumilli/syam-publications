## Work Requirement History

Pennsylvania has no prior Medicaid work requirement implementation experience. The state's 2015 Medicaid expansion replaced an earlier "Healthy Pennsylvania" waiver proposal under Republican Governor Tom Corbett that had included work search requirements. Federal approval required dropping work provisions before implementation. The state established a voluntary employment program called "Encouraging Employment" offering premium reductions for participants but not conditioning coverage on participation.

Governor Tom Wolf transitioned Pennsylvania to standard Medicaid expansion upon taking office in January 2015, eliminating premium requirements and the voluntary work program. The state has operated unmodified expansion since then.

Pennsylvania's SNAP program maintains ABAWD work requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents. The state received federal approval in 2024 to extend ABAWD time-limit waivers through August 2025 covering 58 of 67 counties, exempting an estimated 170,000 individuals from the 80-hour monthly work requirement. This waiver infrastructure provides some administrative foundation but reflects different policy priorities than active enforcement.

## Current Policy and Waiver Status

Pennsylvania has not submitted a Section 1115 waiver proposing Medicaid work requirements. The current political environment indicates minimal enthusiasm for early implementation.

Governor Josh Shapiro, a Democrat elected in 2022, has publicly criticized the One Big Beautiful Bill Act's Medicaid provisions. Following the bill's passage, Shapiro stated Pennsylvania "got screwed" and warned that approximately 310,000 Pennsylvanians could lose Medicaid coverage while 25 rural hospitals operating with deficits face potential closure. The administration's 2025-26 budget explicitly "resisted efforts to kick people off Medicaid."

The state legislature remains divided: Republicans control the Senate while Democrats narrowly control the House. This division has produced compromise budgets but limits major policy initiatives. Work requirements have not emerged as a legislative priority, and the Shapiro administration shows no indication of pursuing early implementation through waiver authority.

Department of Human Services Secretary Val Arkoosh, a physician, has emphasized maintaining coverage and addressing healthcare workforce shortages rather than eligibility restrictions. Recent DHS priorities include direct care worker wage increases, rural hospital support, and behavioral health integration.

No pending waiver applications exist. No state legislation advancing work requirements has passed out of committee. Pennsylvania's posture appears to be reluctant federal compliance rather than enthusiastic adoption.

## Defining Characteristics

**The Urban-Rural Divide**

Pennsylvania's defining implementation challenge is designing a single program that works for populations as different as North Philadelphia and rural Potter County. What constitutes reasonable compliance accommodation differs dramatically between environments.

In Philadelphia, public transit via SEPTA, extensive community-based organization networks, healthcare navigators through Federally Qualified Health Centers, and widespread digital infrastructure create possibilities for outreach and compliance support. DHS offices are transit-accessible. Community health centers, social service agencies, and advocacy organizations provide enrollment assistance. Internet access is generally available through libraries, community centers, and smartphone connectivity.

In rural central Pennsylvania, none of these assumptions hold. Public transit is minimal or nonexistent. DHS offices may require 45-minute drives. Community organizations are sparse. Broadband remains unavailable in many rural areas; cellular coverage is inconsistent. Pennsylvania has only one primary care physician for every 522 rural residents compared to one per 222 urban residents. Compliance systems designed around online portals and urban service infrastructure may be inaccessible to rural residents regardless of willingness to comply.

**Administrative Structure**

Pennsylvania administers Medicaid through the Department of Human Services with county assistance offices (CAOs) handling eligibility determinations. The state operates HealthChoices, a mandatory managed care program covering Physical Health, Behavioral Health, and Community HealthChoices (long-term services and supports). Multiple MCOs operate in each region, creating infrastructure for member outreach and care coordination that could potentially support work requirement compliance.

The county assistance office system creates local relationships but also risks implementation variation across 67 counties. Consistency depends on state training, monitoring, and oversight capacity.

**SNAP E&T Infrastructure**

Pennsylvania operates SNAP Employment and Training through the Bureau of Employment Programs. Programs include SNAP EARN (Employment, Advancement and Retention Network) providing job skills training and case management, SNAP KEYS (Keystone Education Yields Success) partnering with Pennsylvania's 14 community colleges, and SNAP 50/50 programs offering credential training and work experience.

This infrastructure creates coordination opportunities. If members meeting SNAP work requirements receive automatic deemed compliance for Medicaid, administrative burden reduces for people enrolled in both programs. KEYS community college partnerships could count as qualifying education activities.

However, SNAP E&T serves a smaller population than will face Medicaid work requirements. The 830,000 expansion adults substantially exceed current E&T capacity. Scaling supportive services would require significant expansion.

**Provider Tax and Healthcare System Stakes**

Pennsylvania utilizes hospital assessments and provider taxes for Medicaid financing. The state's healthcare systems have financial interest in maintaining coverage levels. Major systems including Penn Medicine, UPMC, Jefferson Health, and regional providers serve substantial Medicaid populations.

Twenty-five rural hospitals operate with deficits and high public payer dependence. These facilities serve communities where work requirement compliance may be most challenging due to limited employment, transportation barriers, and verification difficulties. Coverage losses could accelerate financial pressures on institutions already at risk, potentially triggering closures that compound rural healthcare access problems.

**Political Environment**

The divided government creates both constraints and possibilities. Republican Senate control means the chamber would likely support stricter implementation if given authority. Democratic House and Governor create countervailing pressure toward minimal enforcement. The resulting equilibrium likely produces moderate implementation emphasizing coverage maintenance within federal requirements.

The Shapiro administration's public opposition to work requirements signals the state will not pursue voluntary early implementation and will likely design compliance systems to minimize coverage loss rather than maximize behavioral incentives.

## Expected Policy Posture and Timeline

**Anticipated Approach: Coverage-Protective Implementation**

Pennsylvania will likely implement work requirements emphasizing minimum coverage disruption rather than maximum enforcement. The Shapiro administration's policy preferences, healthcare system financial stakes, and rural hospital vulnerability all point toward designs prioritizing retention.

Specific expectations include:

Broad exemption categories interpreting federal allowances expansively. Pennsylvania will likely seek maximum disability, caregiving, pregnancy, medical frailty, and education exemptions to reduce the population facing active compliance requirements.

Multiple reporting channels including online, telephone, mail, and in-person options. Lessons from Arkansas's online-only catastrophe will inform design. Pennsylvania's rural populations without reliable internet access require non-digital pathways.

Automation where feasible, using unemployment insurance wage data and cross-program information to verify compliance without member action. However, Pennsylvania's systems may require significant development to achieve Ohio-level automation.

Good cause and reasonable accommodation provisions providing flexibility for members experiencing temporary barriers to compliance.

Navigation support through MCO care coordination, community-based organizations, and potentially enhanced county assistance office staffing.

**Timeline**

Pennsylvania appears to be planning for December 2026 implementation aligned with federal requirements:

- 2025: Federal regulatory guidance finalization; state planning and stakeholder engagement; system development begins
- Early 2026: Staff training across 67 county assistance offices; MCO contract modifications; community organization partnerships established
- Mid-2026: Member communications; reporting system activation; pilot testing
- December 2026: Full implementation per federal deadline

The compressed timeline creates urgency for system development, particularly given Pennsylvania's lack of prior implementation infrastructure.

## Summary: What Pennsylvania Is Expected to Do

Pennsylvania will implement federal work requirements reluctantly, designing programs to maintain coverage for as many expansion adults as possible while meeting statutory mandates. The state's Democratic administration opposes work requirements philosophically and has no interest in early adoption or aggressive enforcement.

The 830,000-person expansion population demands scalable verification. Pennsylvania cannot manually process individual compliance determinations for this volume. Some combination of automation using wage data and cross-program matching, deemed compliance from SNAP participation, and streamlined reporting will be necessary.

The urban-rural divide shapes implementation fundamentally. Philadelphia's dense service infrastructure, transit accessibility, and community organization networks enable support systems unavailable in rural Pennsylvania. Statewide policy must accommodate both contexts, likely requiring targeted approaches for isolated communities lacking basic compliance infrastructure.

Whether Pennsylvania can achieve geographic equity remains uncertain. Equal treatment of communities with vastly unequal resources and infrastructure produces unequal outcomes. Rural residents facing longer distances, fewer services, and limited connectivity may experience higher coverage loss rates even with equivalent effort toward compliance.

Philadelphia's concentrated poverty, LEP populations, and immigrant communities require language access, cultural competency, and recognition that informal employment patterns may not generate standard documentation. Verification systems must accommodate cash wages, irregular gig work, and employment arrangements that leave minimal paper trails.

The state's healthcare systems, particularly vulnerable rural hospitals, have financial stakes in implementation design. Coverage losses translate to uncompensated care costs. Provider advocacy may influence policy toward coverage-protective approaches.

Pennsylvania's implementation will demonstrate whether work requirements can function in large, geographically diverse states without recreating Arkansas-style coverage losses. The state's scale, urban-rural divide, and Democratic administration's reluctant compliance position it as a test case for coverage-protective implementation in hostile political terrain.

## Cross-Program Context

**SNAP E&T Alignment**

Pennsylvania operates SNAP E&T through the same DHS structure handling Medicaid. The KEYS program partnership with community colleges and SNAP EARN job training programs create infrastructure potentially adaptable for Medicaid work requirements. If federal regulations permit automatic deemed compliance, SNAP participants meeting work requirements could receive Medicaid credit without separate documentation.

The 170,000 Pennsylvanians currently covered by SNAP ABAWD waivers represent a population that has been exempted from SNAP work requirements and may face Medicaid requirements for the first time.

**TANF Work Requirements**

Pennsylvania TANF includes work requirements administered through county assistance offices. Deemed compliance extending to TANF participants would reduce burden for families receiving both TANF and Medicaid. Existing infrastructure and staff experience with work requirement administration provides baseline capacity.

**Housing Assistance**

Philadelphia Housing Authority and Housing Authority of the City of Pittsburgh operate public housing with populations overlapping Medicaid expansion enrollment. Housing stability affects employment stability; coordination between housing services and Medicaid could support compliance for populations facing housing insecurity.

**Provider Tax Situation**

Pennsylvania relies on hospital assessments for Medicaid financing. Coverage losses creating increased uncompensated care affect hospital financial viability, particularly for rural facilities. Provider systems have financial incentive to support coverage-protective implementation.

**Marketplace Infrastructure**

Pennsylvania operates Pennie, a state-based marketplace providing infrastructure for coverage transitions. Expansion adults losing Medicaid for work requirement noncompliance may qualify for marketplace coverage with premium tax credits depending on income. The 120-day special enrollment period for Medicaid losses during unwinding provides precedent for extended enrollment windows.
