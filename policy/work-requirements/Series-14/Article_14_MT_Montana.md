## Work Requirement History

Montana's experience with work requirements predates the federal mandate, though the state never achieved implementation. Understanding this history illuminates the current policy environment.

**2019 Legislative Action**

The Montana Legislature passed House Bill 658 in May 2019, extending Medicaid expansion for six years while adding community engagement requirements. Representative Ed Buttrey, a Republican from Great Falls who also sponsored the original 2015 expansion legislation, designed the bill as a bipartisan compromise. The legislation required 80 hours monthly of community engagement for enrollees aged 19 to 55, including employment, workforce training, education, volunteering, or substance abuse treatment participation.

The legislation included exemptions for individuals who were blind or disabled, pregnant, mentally or physically unable to work, or acting as primary caregivers for dependent children or elderly relatives. It also provided for graduated premium increases for enrollees remaining on the program beyond two years, rising from 2% to 4% of income.

**Waiver Application and Federal Rejection**

Montana submitted its Section 1115 waiver amendment to CMS on August 30, 2019, seeking federal approval for the community engagement requirements. State administrative rules were promulgated under ARM 37.84.1161 in anticipation of approval. The state planned January 2020 implementation.

CMS did not approve the waiver amendment during 2020. The Trump administration granted a one-year extension of Montana's existing Medicaid expansion program in December 2020, but the work requirement provisions remained unapproved. When the Biden administration took office in January 2021, it notified all states with approved or pending work requirement waivers that these would be reconsidered. Montana's application was never approved.

**Premium Discontinuation**

Montana had previously charged premiums to some Medicaid expansion enrollees under the original HELP Act (2015). The Biden administration declined to renew premium authority in December 2021, determining that premiums create barriers to coverage and do not promote Medicaid's objectives. Montana stopped charging premiums at the end of 2022, though the 2019 legislation had anticipated their continuation.

**2025 Legislative Reauthorization**

The 2025 legislative session brought Medicaid expansion to a decision point. The 2019 legislation included a sunset date of June 30, 2025. Multiple bills were introduced: HB 245 (continuation without sunset), SB 62 (phase-out), and HB 230 (expansion with eliminated work requirements and enhanced beneficiary protections).

HB 245, again sponsored by Representative Buttrey, passed with bipartisan support (63-37 in the House, 30-20 in the Senate) and was signed by Governor Greg Gianforte in March 2025. The legislation removed the recurring sunset provision, making Medicaid expansion permanent unless future legislative action terminates it. Critically, it retained the community engagement requirements enacted in 2019, which had never been implemented due to lack of federal approval.

Governor Gianforte's signing statement emphasized support for work requirements while endorsing Medicaid as a safety net for those who truly need it. The legislation's passage reflected a decade of data demonstrating program effectiveness: reduced uninsured rates, rural hospital stability, and high workforce participation among enrollees.

## Current Policy and Waiver Status

**July 2025 Waiver Application**

Montana became the first state to submit a draft Section 1115 waiver application following passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act's mandatory work requirements. The state released its draft waiver proposal in July 2025 and submitted a formal application to CMS in September 2025.

The Montana proposal largely aligns with federal requirements but includes several state-specific elements reflecting lessons from other states' failures and Montana's unique demographics.

**Key Design Elements**

*Hour Requirements:* The proposal maintains the 80 hours monthly threshold established in the 2019 legislation and required by federal law. Qualifying activities include employment, workforce training, continuing education, substance abuse treatment, volunteering, and community service.

*Exemption Categories:* Montana's proposal includes exemptions mandated by federal law (medical frailty, elderly, pregnancy, disability) plus additional state-specific exemptions:
- Tribal members residing on reservations (automatic exemption)
- Veterans
- Individuals experiencing homelessness or fleeing domestic violence
- Full-time college students
- Disabled individuals (broader than federal medical frailty definition)

*Tribal Provisions:* Recognizing that 18% of expansion enrollees are Native American and that reservation infrastructure makes conventional verification structurally difficult, the waiver proposes automatic exemptions for members residing on tribal lands. This approach acknowledges both tribal sovereignty and practical reality: unemployment rates on some Montana reservations exceed 50%, transportation options are limited, and internet access for online verification is unreliable.

*Premium Reinstatement:* The waiver also seeks authority to reinstate premiums, with enrollees paying 2% of income in the first three years and higher percentages thereafter. The state acknowledges that federal law prohibits premiums starting in 2028 and indicates it will seek an exemption from that prohibition.

**CMS Review Process**

CMS opened a public comment period on Montana's proposal running through October 18, 2025. Early public comments have been overwhelmingly opposed, with many requesting the state delay implementation beyond the federal deadline to ensure adequate systems and navigation support.

The Trump administration has expressed support for Montana's approach. CMS has characterized state-led work requirement designs as appropriate exercises of state flexibility within federal guardrails.

**State Estimates**

Montana DPHHS estimates that approximately 65% of expansion enrollees either meet work requirements or qualify for exemptions without taking any action. The state projects 17.5% of enrollees will lose coverage due to community engagement requirements, with an additional 1.5-2.5% disenrolled for premium non-payment.

These projections imply approximately 13,000-16,000 Montanans losing Medicaid coverage due to work requirements. Health policy researchers consider these estimates optimistic, with KFF projecting 34,000 Montanans could lose coverage when accounting for administrative barriers that cause people meeting requirements to nonetheless lose coverage.

## Defining Characteristics

**Frontier Geography**

Montana presents implementation challenges unlike any other state. The term "frontier" describes areas with 6 or fewer persons per square mile; 45 of Montana's 56 counties meet this definition. A former U.S. Senator described the state memorably: "There's a lot of dirt between light bulbs in Montana."

This geography creates structural barriers to conventional work requirement approaches. A resident of Phillips County in north-central Montana may live 100 miles from the nearest workforce development center. A rancher in Carter County has no public transportation options. A timber worker in Lincoln County may lack reliable internet for online verification.

Verification systems designed for urban populations with readily accessible employers, training programs, and digital infrastructure fail predictably in frontier settings. Montana's 50 Critical Access Hospitals, more than any state, exist precisely because populations are too dispersed for conventional healthcare delivery. Work requirement verification faces identical challenges.

**Tribal Sovereignty and Healthcare**

Montana's relationship with its eight federally recognized tribes shapes every aspect of Medicaid implementation. Native Americans comprise 18% of Medicaid expansion enrollees, more than double their share of the state population. The federal trust responsibility to provide healthcare through Indian Health Service creates parallel systems that work requirements must accommodate.

IHS facilities receive 100% federal reimbursement for Medicaid-enrolled tribal members, making Medicaid expansion particularly valuable to tribal healthcare infrastructure. The Montana Healthcare Foundation documented that expansion revenue has allowed tribal health facilities to expand services, hire additional providers, and extend hours of operation. Tribal behavioral health facilities have seen dramatic increases in patient visits since expansion.

However, IHS has historically been chronically underfunded, with per-capita spending roughly one-third of Medicare/Medicaid levels. Medicaid expansion fills gaps IHS cannot cover. Coverage losses from work requirements would shift costs back to an already strained system, potentially forcing return to "life and limb only" emergency coverage that characterized pre-expansion tribal healthcare.

The waiver's tribal exemption provisions represent an acknowledgment that verification systems functional in Billings would fail on the Fort Peck Reservation.

**Seasonal Employment Economy**

Montana's economy runs on industries with dramatic seasonal variation. Tourism around Glacier and Yellowstone National Parks generates employment peaks in summer months and near-zero activity in winter. Agricultural work, from spring calving through fall harvest, produces months of intensive labor followed by minimal employment. Timber operations are weather-dependent.

A ski resort worker in Whitefish may log 60 hours weekly from December through March and zero hours from May through November. A grain farmer near Havre may work 100-hour weeks during harvest and spend winter months with minimal documented employment. A fishing guide in the Missouri River valley may be fully employed June through September and seek alternative work the rest of the year.

Federal work requirements specify monthly hour thresholds without accommodation for seasonal patterns. How Montana handles workers whose legitimate employment doesn't produce consistent monthly hours will determine whether the policy functions as coverage pathway or enrollment barrier.

## Expected Policy Posture and Timeline

**Anticipated Approach: Accelerated Implementation**

Montana is pursuing work requirements ahead of the federal December 2026 deadline. If the Section 1115 waiver receives CMS approval, implementation could begin as early as 2026. State officials have characterized early implementation as ensuring Montana controls its own program design rather than defaulting to federal specifications.

Representative Buttrey, who has guided Medicaid expansion legislation for a decade, expressed concern about the implementation timeline. Successful work requirement programs, he noted, require adequate verification infrastructure before launch. Rushing implementation risks replicating Arkansas's 2018 experience, where 18,164 people lost coverage largely due to administrative failures rather than actual noncompliance.

**Staffing and Infrastructure Needs**

State health officials have indicated implementation will require approximately 50 additional staff positions to process applications and determine eligibility. This represents significant expansion of an agency already processing the ongoing population of 200,000+ Medicaid enrollees.

The staffing requirement reflects work requirements' fundamental characteristic: they transform eligibility from a periodic verification (annual income check) to an ongoing monitoring system (monthly or six-monthly activity verification). This administrative transformation requires proportional staffing increases.

**Key Timeline Elements**

- July 2025: Draft waiver proposal released
- September 2025: Formal waiver application submitted to CMS
- October 2025: CMS public comment period closes
- Late 2025: Expected CMS negotiation and approval
- Early 2026: System development, staff hiring, MCO contract modifications
- Mid-2026: Potential pilot implementation
- December 2026: Federal deadline for work requirement implementation
- January 2027: Full federal requirement takes effect

**Critical Uncertainties**

*Tribal Coordination:* Whether automatic exemptions will function smoothly, or whether tribal administration alternatives will develop, remains unclear. Consultations with tribal governments are ongoing.

*Seasonal Worker Treatment:* The waiver application acknowledges seasonal employment patterns but does not specify accommodation mechanisms. How monthly requirements interact with legitimate seasonal employment will test system flexibility.

*Rural Verification Infrastructure:* Whether workers in frontier counties can realistically document compliance without internet access, nearby employers willing to provide verification, or accessible workforce development services remains the central implementation question.

*Premium Interaction:* The waiver seeks premium authority that federal law prohibits starting in 2028. If premiums are implemented 2026-2027 and then terminated, the enrollment disruption from that policy whiplash adds complexity to an already challenging transition.

## Cross-Program Context

**SNAP Alignment**

Montana operates SNAP employment and training requirements separately from Medicaid. No automatic deemed compliance exists between programs. A Medicaid enrollee meeting SNAP ABAWD requirements would need to separately document Medicaid compliance unless the waiver establishes alignment mechanisms.

**TANF Work Requirements**

Montana's TANF work requirements serve a different population (primarily families with children receiving cash assistance). TANF and Medicaid systems operate independently with separate verification mechanisms, though workforce development infrastructure can serve both populations.

**Provider Tax Situation**

Montana relies relatively modestly on provider taxes for Medicaid financing compared to states like New York. The hospital utilization fee ($26.24 per inpatient bed per day) supports expansion costs alongside federal matching and state general fund contributions. In SFY 2024, state general fund contributions averaged only $36 per client per month, approximately $360 annually, compared to over $6,400 annually for employer-sponsored coverage.

**Rural Hospital Stability**

No rural hospitals have closed in Montana since Medicaid expansion began in 2016, despite 136 rural hospital closures nationally during the same period, 74% in non-expansion states. Uncompensated care at critical access hospitals declined 35% following expansion. Work requirement coverage losses would reverse these gains, potentially threatening facilities in communities with no alternative healthcare access.

## Summary: What Montana Is Expected to Do

Montana will implement work requirements through a hybrid approach reflecting its unique demographic and geographic characteristics. Tribal populations will receive automatic exemptions rather than face verification requirements impossible to meet on reservations. The state will attempt administrative data matching for employment verification where possible, relying on unemployment insurance wage data and cross-program information. Frontier counties will require alternative verification mechanisms accommodating populations without internet access or proximate workforce infrastructure.

The fundamental tension in Montana's approach is between aggressive timeline (seeking implementation before federal deadline) and pragmatic design (extensive exemptions, tribal accommodations, seasonal flexibility). Whether both objectives can be achieved simultaneously is uncertain. The state's 2019-2025 experience, where work requirements were legislatively mandated but never implemented due to federal rejection, provides no operational lessons. Montana enters implementation without the painful education Arkansas and Georgia received.

The 34,000 coverage losses projected by KFF would represent nearly half of the expansion population, transforming the program's character and reversing a decade of rural healthcare stabilization. Whether Montana can design systems that maintain coverage while satisfying work requirement mandates will depend on choices not yet fully specified in the waiver application.

Montana's experience will matter beyond its borders. The state's frontier geography, tribal populations, and seasonal economy represent implementation challenges other states face at smaller scale. If Montana can make work requirements function in Glacier County, states struggling with rural pockets can learn from that success. If Montana cannot, the policy's operational limits will be demonstrated in America's most challenging implementation environment.
