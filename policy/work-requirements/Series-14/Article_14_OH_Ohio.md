## Work Requirement History

Ohio has no implemented work requirement experience but has substantial policy development history that shapes current approaches.

**2019 Waiver Application**

Ohio submitted a Section 1115 waiver amendment in April 2019 proposing community engagement requirements for the expansion population. The proposal included 80-hour monthly requirements with exemptions for disability, caregiving, pregnancy, and other circumstances.

The distinctive feature of Ohio's 2019 proposal was its emphasis on automated verification through administrative data matching. Rather than requiring members to self-report work hours through portals or phone systems, Ohio proposed verifying employment through unemployment insurance wage data, identifying disability exemptions through Social Security data, and confirming caregiver status through birth records and dependent data.

Federal court decisions vacating Arkansas and Kentucky waivers in March 2019 created uncertainty. Ohio's application remained pending through 2019 and into 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 triggered the continuous enrollment requirement, and Ohio withdrew its application rather than proceed with implementation during the public health emergency.

**Lessons from the 2019 Design Process**

Ohio's development work produced several insights that inform current planning:

*Scale Demands Automation:* With 700,000+ expansion adults, Ohio concluded that manual verification through member reporting was operationally infeasible. The state would need to process 700,000 monthly compliance determinations, handle hundreds of thousands of exemption requests, and manage appeals for disputed cases. No state workforce could handle this volume through manual review.

*Data Matching Feasibility:* Ohio's analysis determined that approximately 60-70% of expansion adults could have compliance verified through existing administrative data without any member action. Employment could be confirmed through unemployment insurance quarterly wage reports. Disability exemptions could be identified through Social Security disability data. Caregiver exemptions for parents of young children could be confirmed through vital records data.

*The Residual Challenge:* The 30-40% of expansion adults whose compliance cannot be verified through administrative data represent the implementation challenge. This population includes gig workers whose income doesn't appear in wage data, people with informal employment, those qualifying for exemptions not captured in administrative systems, and people whose circumstances changed after the most recent data update.

**SNAP Work Requirements Experience**

Ohio operates SNAP Able-Bodied Adults Without Dependents (ABAWD) work requirements through the same county-administered system that handles Medicaid eligibility. This experience provides infrastructure and lessons:

- County Job and Family Services offices have work requirement administration capacity
- Workforce development partnerships exist in all 88 counties
- Data systems can track compliance status
- Appeals infrastructure is established

However, SNAP ABAWD requirements cover a smaller population with different characteristics than Medicaid expansion adults. The Medicaid population is larger, more diverse in circumstances, and includes many people already meeting requirements through employment but not through formally documented channels.

## Current Policy and Waiver Status

**February 2025 Waiver Submission**

Ohio submitted its Section 1115 waiver amendment in February 2025 as required under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act provisions. The application builds directly on the 2019 design, updated to reflect federal requirements and lessons from other states' experiences.

Core design elements:

*Automated Verification Priority:* The waiver establishes a hierarchy of verification methods, prioritizing administrative data matching before requiring any member action:

1. Unemployment insurance wage data: Quarterly wage reports identify employed members. Anyone showing wages meeting the 80-hour threshold is automatically deemed compliant.

2. Social Security data: Disability determinations from SSA identify members qualifying for disability exemptions without member documentation.

3. SNAP/TANF compliance: Members meeting work requirements under other programs are automatically deemed compliant for Medicaid, eliminating duplicative verification.

4. Vital records: Birth certificates and dependent relationships identify caregivers of young children for exemption purposes.

5. Exception processing: Only members not verified through automated channels enter active verification workflows requiring member action.

*County Administration:* Like all Ohio Medicaid eligibility functions, work requirement administration will occur through the county Job and Family Services (JFS) system. This creates 88 potential implementation variations but leverages existing relationships between county workers and Medicaid recipients.

*Exemption Categories:* Ohio's proposal includes federal-required exemptions plus state additions: pregnancy through 60 days postpartum, disability (SSI/SSDI recipients plus medically frail), caregivers of children under six or dependents with disabilities, full-time students, individuals receiving unemployment benefits, participants in substance use disorder treatment programs, individuals engaged with workforce development programs, and victims of domestic violence.

*Reporting Frequency:* Annual reporting at redetermination for most members. Quarterly reporting only for members whose compliance could not be verified through automated channels. This reduces reporting burden dramatically compared to monthly requirements that overwhelmed other states.

**Legislative Context**

Ohio's Republican-controlled legislature has supported work requirements conceptually. Governor DeWine signed legislation in 2023 directing the Ohio Department of Medicaid to pursue implementation following federal authorization. The bipartisan support for Medicaid expansion in Ohio (approved by ballot initiative) coexists with conservative interest in work-related conditions.

**Administrative Preparation**

The Ohio Department of Medicaid has been developing implementation infrastructure since 2023:

- Data sharing agreements with Ohio Department of Job and Family Services for wage data
- Interface development between eligibility systems and federal databases
- County training curriculum for work requirement administration
- MCO contract modifications to incorporate care coordination support
- Appeals process development with county hearing structure

## Defining Characteristics

**The Automation Imperative**

Ohio's defining characteristic is the explicit recognition that its population size requires automation. The state cannot process 700,000 manual compliance determinations. This isn't a policy preference; it's operational mathematics.

The automation strategy offers potential benefits: most members may achieve compliance without taking any action if their wages appear in administrative data. But it also creates risks: people whose circumstances don't fit administrative categories may face compliance challenges despite legitimately meeting requirements or qualifying for exemptions.

The gig worker driving for DoorDash and Uber, paid through 1099 rather than W-2, won't appear in unemployment insurance wage data. The home health aide employed by a family directly rather than through an agency may have unreported wages. The person caring for an elderly parent without formal documentation of the care relationship won't be automatically identified for exemption.

Ohio's design acknowledges this residual population but depends on exception processing working smoothly. If the exception pathway creates barriers comparable to Arkansas's 2018 system, automation for the majority won't prevent harm to the minority whose circumstances require manual verification.

**Appalachian Ohio**

The 32 Appalachian counties in southeastern Ohio present distinctive implementation challenges. These counties share characteristics with West Virginia and Kentucky: severe opioid epidemic impact, multi-generational poverty, limited employment opportunity, educational attainment below state average, and healthcare infrastructure gaps.

Several dynamics shape Appalachian implementation:

*Employment Scarcity:* Unlike metropolitan Ohio where jobs exist but documentation may be challenging, Appalachian Ohio faces actual job scarcity. Athens County (home to Ohio University) has different economics than neighboring Meigs County where the largest employers are the school district and county government.

*Substance Use Disorder Concentration:* Appalachian Ohio has among the highest overdose death rates in the nation. The SUD treatment exemption will be heavily utilized, but treatment availability limits access. Some counties have no medication-assisted treatment providers.

*Transportation Barriers:* Public transportation is essentially nonexistent in rural Appalachia. Workforce development programs and verification offices may be 30+ miles from members' homes on roads that become impassable in winter.

*Digital Access:* Broadband penetration remains low in Appalachian counties. Online verification options that work in Columbus may be inaccessible in Vinton County.

**County Administration Complexity**

Ohio's county-administered Medicaid system creates both opportunities and risks. The 88 county JFS offices provide local presence and relationships that centralized state administration cannot match. A caseworker in Athens County may know that a particular family's circumstances make compliance impossible and can document exemptions accordingly.

But county administration also creates 88 potential variations in how requirements are interpreted and enforced. A strict interpretation in one county could cause coverage losses while a flexible interpretation in the neighboring county maintains coverage for people with identical circumstances. Statewide consistency is difficult when implementation is local.

The state must balance respect for county operational autonomy against the need for consistent member treatment. Training, monitoring, and appeals oversight become critical to preventing geographic disparities in outcomes.

**The Three Ohios**

Implementation must serve three distinct Ohios with different characteristics:

*Metropolitan Ohio:* Cleveland, Columbus, and Cincinnati have robust employment markets, extensive service infrastructure, and MCO capacity for care coordination. Automation should work well here; most members are employed in formal economy jobs captured in wage data. The challenge is gig workers and informal employment.

*Small City Ohio:* Dayton, Toledo, Akron, Youngstown, and similar cities face legacy manufacturing decline, elevated poverty and unemployment, and strained service infrastructure. Employment exists but is increasingly precarious. Healthcare systems serve as major employers. Automation may identify fewer compliant members; more will need exception processing.

*Appalachian Ohio:* As described above, fundamentally different circumstances require fundamentally different approaches. What works in Columbus fails in McArthur.

**MCO Infrastructure**

Ohio's Medicaid managed care program provides implementation capacity through contracted MCOs: CareSource, Molina Healthcare, Buckeye Health Plan (Centene), AmeriHealth Caritas Ohio, and UnitedHealthcare Community Plan. These MCOs have existing relationships with expansion adults, care coordination staff, and data systems.

The state's approach integrates work requirement support into MCO responsibilities:

- Care coordinators will identify members at compliance risk during routine contacts
- MCOs will provide referrals to workforce development resources
- Automated compliance alerts will trigger outreach to members needing assistance
- MCO performance metrics may eventually incorporate compliance rates

This integration leverages existing infrastructure rather than building parallel systems. But it also means MCOs must add work requirement functions to already-stretched care coordination capacity.

## Expected Policy Posture and Timeline

**Anticipated Approach: Automation-Centered Moderate**

Ohio's implementation philosophy centers on automation to achieve compliance without member burden for the majority, combined with exception processing for members whose circumstances require documentation. The state is neither pursuing maximum enforcement nor zero-friction exemption.

The moderate posture reflects political balance: Republican legislature supporting work requirements conceptually, but practical recognition that mass coverage losses would create political backlash and healthcare system strain. The automation emphasis allows the state to claim robust verification while actually minimizing the population facing active compliance requirements.

**Timeline**

- February 2025: Waiver amendment submitted
- Spring 2025: CMS negotiation and public comment
- Summer 2025: CMS approval anticipated
- Fall 2025: System development and testing; county training
- Winter 2025-2026: MCO contract modifications; data interface finalization
- Spring 2026: Pilot testing in selected counties
- December 2026: Full implementation aligned with federal deadline

**Key Uncertainties**

*Automation Coverage:* What percentage of expansion adults will actually have compliance verified through automated channels? Ohio estimates 60-70%, but this depends on wage data timeliness, data matching accuracy, and how many members have circumstances fitting administrative categories.

*Exception Processing Volume:* If automation covers only 50% rather than 70%, the exception processing system faces double the anticipated volume. Capacity to handle that volume without creating barriers is uncertain.

*Appalachian Outcomes:* Whether automation-centered design works in regions where employment is scarce and circumstances rarely fit standard categories will determine whether work requirements cause geographic concentration of coverage losses.

*County Consistency:* Whether 88 county JFS offices implement requirements consistently enough to prevent arbitrary geographic variation in outcomes is unknown. State oversight capacity to identify and address inconsistency is limited.

## Summary: What Ohio Is Expected to Do

Ohio will implement work requirements through an automation-first strategy, using administrative data matching to verify compliance for the majority of expansion adults without requiring member action. Unemployment insurance wage data, Social Security disability records, SNAP/TANF compliance status, and vital records will identify employed and exempt members automatically. Only those not verified through automated channels will face active reporting requirements.

This approach reflects operational necessity more than policy preference. With 700,000+ expansion adults, Ohio cannot process individual compliance determinations manually. Automation is the only path to scale.

The critical test is whether the exception processing system serving the 30-40% not captured by automation creates barriers comparable to those that caused coverage losses in Arkansas. The Appalachian population, gig workers, informal economy participants, and people with undocumented exemption circumstances depend on smooth exception pathways that Ohio has designed but not yet operated.

County administration creates local relationships that can support compliance but also risks 88 different interpretations of requirements. Statewide consistency depends on training, monitoring, and appeals oversight that the state is developing but has never operated at this scale.

Ohio's outcomes will be watched closely by other large states considering automation strategies. If the approach maintains coverage while meeting verification requirements, automation becomes the model for populous states. If exception processing creates barriers and coverage losses concentrate among populations automation cannot serve, the limits of the strategy become apparent.

## Cross-Program Context

**SNAP E&T Alignment**

Ohio operates SNAP Employment & Training through county JFS offices, the same infrastructure handling Medicaid eligibility. The state's waiver includes automatic deemed compliance: members meeting SNAP work requirements are automatically compliant for Medicaid. This reduces duplicative burden and leverages existing verification.

**TANF Work Requirements**

Ohio Works First (TANF) includes work requirements administered by county JFS. Automatic deemed compliance extends to TANF participants. The infrastructure and workforce development partnerships developed for TANF support Medicaid implementation.

**Workforce Development Integration**

OhioMeansJobs, the state's workforce development system, integrates with Medicaid planning. Participation in workforce development programs counts as qualifying activity. The connection between coverage maintenance and employment services is explicit in Ohio's design.

**Provider Tax Situation**

Ohio relies significantly on hospital assessments for Medicaid financing. If work requirements cause substantial coverage losses, hospitals serving newly uninsured populations face increased uncompensated care. Cleveland Clinic, Ohio State Wexner, and other major systems have interest in coverage maintenance.

**Marketplace Infrastructure**

Ohio operates on the federally facilitated marketplace. Expansion adults losing Medicaid may qualify for marketplace coverage with premium tax credits depending on income. However, the transition creates coverage gaps, and marketplace plans have different provider networks and cost-sharing than Medicaid.
