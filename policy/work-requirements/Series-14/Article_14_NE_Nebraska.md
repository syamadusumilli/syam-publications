## Work Requirement History

Nebraska has a conflicted history with Medicaid work requirements that reflects broader tensions between a conservative state government and voter-driven Medicaid expansion. This history provides important context for understanding how the state will approach federal requirements.

**Ballot Initiative and Reluctant Implementation**

Nebraska voters approved Medicaid expansion through Initiative 427 in November 2018 with 53% support, overriding years of legislative resistance. The ballot measure required expansion to adults earning up to 138% of the federal poverty level as called for in the Affordable Care Act. Governor Pete Ricketts, who had opposed expansion, nonetheless began implementation planning.

**The Tiered Benefit Experiment**

The Ricketts administration sought to modify expansion through a Section 1115 waiver proposing a two-tiered benefit structure. Under this design, expansion enrollees would receive "basic" coverage at enrollment but would need to complete wellness requirements and community engagement (work requirements) to access "prime" benefits including dental, vision, and over-the-counter drug coverage.

CMS approved the waiver during the first Trump administration, and Nebraska launched Medicaid expansion in October 2020 with the tiered structure in place. However, the timing coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic, complicating both implementation and assessment.

**Abandonment of Work Requirements**

The tiered benefit system proved administratively complex and generated significant opposition. Nebraska Appleseed, a statewide advocacy organization, filed suit arguing the structure violated the terms of the ballot initiative that voters approved. Following the Biden administration's clear signal that work requirements would not be permitted in Medicaid, Nebraska announced in June 2021 that it was abandoning the tiered benefit system.

Beginning October 1, 2021, all expansion enrollees automatically received the full "prime" benefit package including dental, vision, and over-the-counter coverage. The state discontinued work requirement planning, and the infrastructure that had been developed was largely dismantled.

**Lessons from the Brief Experiment**

Nebraska's experience, though abbreviated, revealed several dynamics relevant to federal implementation. Administrative complexity created barriers even before enforcement began. The tiered structure confused both enrollees and providers about benefit availability. When the state abandoned the approach, enrollment stabilization improved significantly. Nebraska reached approximately 75,000 expansion enrollees by 2022, near the 90,000 originally projected but never achieved under the tiered system.

## Current Policy and Waiver Status

**Political Environment**

Governor Jim Pillen, who took office in January 2023, represents continuity with the conservative Republican governance that preceded him. The Nebraska Legislature is unicameral and officially nonpartisan but functions as a Republican-majority body. Democrats hold a minority of seats, though a small group of moderate Republicans occasionally creates unpredictable coalition dynamics.

Pillen has not actively pursued Medicaid work requirements in the absence of federal mandate. His administration has focused on other Medicaid priorities including eliminating the developmental disabilities waiting list, implementing the Hospital Quality Assurance and Access Assessment program (LB 1087), and extending postpartum coverage to 12 months.

**Current Waiver Status**

Nebraska does not currently have a pending Section 1115 waiver application proposing work requirements. The state operates standard Medicaid expansion under the ACA without demonstration authority for community engagement requirements. The Heritage Health managed care program covers expansion adults alongside traditional Medicaid populations.

**Recent Policy Actions**

The Pillen administration has demonstrated conservative priorities through actions unrelated to work requirements, including signing an executive order restricting Medicaid payments to abortion providers and supporting federal SNAP work requirement enforcement. These actions suggest philosophical alignment with work requirement principles even without active state-level pursuit.

In June 2025, Governor Pillen signed LB 192, which prohibits Nebraska from seeking SNAP work requirement waivers and permanently sets SNAP eligibility at 165% of the federal poverty level. This action demonstrates the administration's commitment to work requirements in federal benefit programs while also maintaining broader eligibility for the working poor.

**Administrative Infrastructure**

Nebraska operates Medicaid through the Division of Medicaid and Long-Term Care within the Department of Health and Human Services. The Heritage Health managed care program contracts with three MCOs: Molina Healthcare of Nebraska, Nebraska Total Care (Centene subsidiary), and UnitedHealthcare Community Plan of the Midlands. These contracts began January 1, 2024, and run for five years with renewal options.

The state implemented a centralized credentialing system through Verisys in 2024-2025, reducing administrative burden on providers. The iServe Nebraska integrated benefit application launched in October 2023, creating a single portal for food, utilities, and healthcare applications.

## Defining Characteristics

Several features distinguish Nebraska from other expansion states and will shape its work requirement implementation.

**The Meatpacking Dynamic**

Nebraska's economy depends heavily on meatpacking and food processing industries that employ large numbers of immigrants, including substantial undocumented populations. Towns like Lexington, Grand Island, Schuyler, and Columbus have been transformed by meatpacking plants, with Hispanic populations now comprising 50% or more of some communities.

Work requirements in these communities face unique complications. Many workers are employed full-time in physically demanding jobs but may lack formal documentation or employer cooperation with verification systems. Cash economy employment, employer reluctance to provide documentation, and immigration enforcement create barriers to demonstrating compliance even for people who are clearly working.

The June 2025 immigration raid at Glenn Valley Foods in Omaha, which detained approximately 100 workers despite the company's compliance with E-Verify, illustrates the precarious situation facing immigrant workers. Work requirement verification in these communities will need to navigate documentation challenges while avoiding creating additional fear that discourages enrollment among eligible populations.

**Geographic Extremes**

Nebraska's urban-rural divide creates starkly different implementation environments. Omaha and Lincoln have robust healthcare infrastructure, community organizations, and verification systems. Western Nebraska has minimal infrastructure for anything requiring in-person engagement.

Douglas and Sarpy counties (Omaha metro) contain 40% of the state population in less than 2% of the land area. Many western counties have populations under 1,000 spread across hundreds of square miles. Internet connectivity remains limited in frontier areas. Travel times to employment centers or verification offices can exceed 60 minutes each way.

Implementation approaches that work in Omaha will fail in Scottsbluff or Valentine. The state will need to develop rural-appropriate verification methods or risk disproportionate coverage losses in already underserved communities.

**Tribal Populations**

Four federally recognized tribes maintain reservations in Nebraska, primarily in the northeastern corner of the state. The Winnebago and Omaha reservations in Thurston County and the Santee Sioux and Ponca service areas in Knox County present distinct implementation challenges.

Tribal members face potential jurisdictional complexity between state requirements and tribal sovereignty. The Winnebago Tribe's economic success through Ho-Chunk Inc. has created employment opportunities on the reservation, but many tribal members work in seasonal or traditional activities that may not produce standard employment documentation.

**Tight Labor Markets**

Nebraska's persistent labor shortage, with only 39-66 workers available per 100 job openings depending on sector, creates paradoxical dynamics for work requirements. Employers desperately need workers and cannot afford to discourage employment through complex documentation requirements. At the same time, the strong labor market means most expansion adults are already working; 75% report employment, with 45% working full-time.

The primary compliance challenge will be documentation and verification rather than actual employment. People who are working may lose coverage not because they fail to meet hour requirements but because they cannot navigate reporting systems while working demanding schedules.

## Expected Policy Posture and Timeline

**Posture: Reluctant Compliance**

Nebraska is expected to implement federal work requirements with minimal state-level enhancement. The Pillen administration philosophically supports work requirements but has not invested in building independent verification infrastructure. The state abandoned work requirement planning in 2021 and would be starting largely from scratch.

The most likely approach involves using existing workforce system connections, leveraging SNAP coordination where possible, and relying on MCOs to manage navigation and compliance support. Nebraska will probably adopt standard federal exemptions without significant expansion and implement minimum verification frequency permitted under federal rules.

**Implementation Timeline**

- 2025: Federal regulatory guidance finalization; state planning begins
- Early 2026: System development; MCO contract amendments; navigator training
- Mid-2026: Member communications; reporting system activation
- December 2026: Federal work requirement effective date
- 2027: First full compliance period; enforcement begins

**Key Decision Points**

Nebraska faces several policy choices that will determine implementation character:

*Reporting Frequency:* Monthly reporting creates maximum administrative burden but provides continuous compliance monitoring. Annual or semi-annual reporting reduces burden but delays identification of noncompliance. Nebraska's 2021 experience suggests preference for lower-friction approaches.

*Verification Methods:* Automated data matching reduces enrollee burden but requires robust data sharing infrastructure. Self-attestation simplifies reporting but raises integrity concerns. Nebraska's labor market characteristics, including cash economy employment and immigrant documentation issues, suggest data matching alone will be insufficient.

*Exemption Categories:* Federal law specifies certain exemptions; states have discretion in implementation details and may add state-specific exemptions. Nebraska's meatpacking communities, tribal populations, and frontier geography suggest need for accommodation, but conservative governance may resist expansive exemptions.

*Rural Adaptations:* Standard urban verification approaches will fail in frontier Nebraska. The state must either develop rural-appropriate alternatives or accept disproportionate coverage loss in already healthcare-scarce regions.

## Summary: What Nebraska Is Expected to Do

Nebraska will implement federal work requirements beginning December 2026 as a reluctant compliance exercise rather than an enthusiastic state initiative. The Pillen administration supports work requirements philosophically but has not invested in building implementation infrastructure, having abandoned such efforts in 2021.

The state's primary implementation advantages include strong managed care infrastructure through the Heritage Health program, relatively small expansion population (72,000 adults) enabling more personalized approaches, and very tight labor markets meaning most enrollees are already working. The Heritage Health MCOs, particularly Nebraska Total Care and UnitedHealthcare, bring national experience with compliance systems and SDOH navigation.

The primary challenges center on Nebraska's distinctive population characteristics. Meatpacking communities with large immigrant populations face documentation barriers even when workers clearly meet hour requirements. Frontier western Nebraska lacks infrastructure for any verification approach requiring connectivity or physical presence. Tribal populations require coordination between state requirements and tribal sovereignty.

The critical question for Nebraska is whether the state can design verification systems that accommodate its unique workforce while maintaining compliance with federal requirements. The meatpacking dynamic particularly presents risks: workers who are employed 50-60 hours weekly in physically demanding jobs may lose coverage because employers will not provide documentation, workers fear immigration enforcement, or verification systems cannot accommodate non-standard employment arrangements.

Nebraska's 2021 experience abandoning the tiered benefit system suggests the state recognizes that high-friction implementation creates coverage losses without proportionate benefit. Whether this institutional memory translates into coverage-protective implementation under federal mandate remains uncertain. The December 2026 deadline provides approximately 14 months to build systems the state spent two years developing and then abandoned in 2021.

## Cross-Program Context

**SNAP Employment and Training**

Nebraska operates SNAP E&T through the Department of Health and Human Services alongside Medicaid. LB 192, signed in June 2025, prohibits the state from seeking SNAP work requirement waivers, ensuring ABAWD requirements remain in effect statewide regardless of local unemployment conditions.

The same legislation maintains SNAP eligibility at 165% of the federal poverty level, higher than the federal minimum. This creates a population receiving SNAP benefits who earn too much for Medicaid, potentially complicating cross-program coordination.

Deemed compliance between SNAP and Medicaid work requirements could significantly reduce verification burden. Many expansion adults also receive SNAP benefits; automatic recognition of SNAP compliance would eliminate duplicate reporting for this population.

**TANF Work Requirements**

Nebraska's TANF program includes standard work requirements for a small population primarily consisting of families with children receiving cash assistance. TANF and Medicaid operate through the same department, creating coordination potential, though the populations overlap only partially.

**Provider Tax Structure**

The Hospital Quality Assurance and Access Assessment Act (LB 1087), signed in 2024 and implemented in 2025, creates a provider tax mechanism generating approximately $1 billion annually in additional federal Medicaid funding for Nebraska hospitals. This represents a significant policy shift; Nebraska was previously one of few states not utilizing provider tax mechanisms.

Hospital systems now have substantial financial interest in maintaining Medicaid coverage. Coverage losses from work requirements would reduce patient volume and associated provider tax revenue. This creates hospital system incentives to support navigation infrastructure that maintains enrollment.

**Marketplace Infrastructure**

Nebraska uses the federal healthcare.gov marketplace rather than operating a state-based exchange. Enhanced ACA subsidies, if maintained, provide coverage options for expansion adults losing Medicaid coverage who have income above 100% FPL. Those below 100% FPL would have no affordable coverage alternative.

**Tribal Programs**

The four federally recognized Nebraska tribes operate their own health programs with varying levels of integration with state systems. The Winnebago Tribe's economic development success through Ho-Chunk Inc. has created healthcare service capacity on the reservation. Tribal-state coordination mechanisms for work requirement exemptions will require development, as Nebraska has no recent experience with tribal Medicaid exemption administration.
