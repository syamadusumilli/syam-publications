## The Prepaid Health Care Act: Hawaii's Unique Foundation

Hawaii operates within a fundamentally different health coverage framework than any other state. The Prepaid Health Care Act of 1974 requires private employers to provide health insurance to employees working at least 20 hours per week for four consecutive weeks. This employer mandate, which predates the Affordable Care Act by nearly four decades, means Hawaii has long maintained among the lowest uninsured rates nationally.

The PHCA creates distinctive dynamics for work requirement implementation. Most working Hawaiians already have employer-sponsored coverage rather than Medicaid. The expansion population therefore concentrates among those whose employment patterns fall outside the PHCA framework: part-time workers averaging fewer than 20 hours weekly, self-employed individuals, gig economy workers, seasonal employees in agriculture, and those between jobs.

This structural reality means Hawaii's Medicaid expansion population differs from mainland states. Where other expansion states serve large populations of employed but uninsured workers, Hawaii's expansion adults more frequently include those in genuinely precarious employment situations. A worker averaging 19 hours weekly falls below the PHCA threshold but may well be meeting an 80-hour monthly work requirement; the documentation challenge becomes proving hours across multiple employers or variable schedules.

The PHCA also creates employer behavior effects. Research suggests Hawaii has a disproportionate share of workers scheduled just below the 20-hour threshold, though causation remains debated. Whether this reflects employer avoidance of the mandate or pre-existing employment patterns, the phenomenon creates a population that works but lacks employer coverage and may face verification challenges under work requirements.

## No Prior Work Requirement History

Hawaii has never implemented or sought approval for Medicaid work requirements. The state expanded Medicaid in 2014 under Governor Neil Abercrombie and has maintained strong Democratic control throughout the expansion period. No serious legislative effort to impose work requirements has emerged.

The absence of prior experience means Hawaii has no failed implementation to learn from, no existing verification infrastructure, and no institutional knowledge about managing work requirement compliance. Everything must be built from scratch by December 2026.

## Current Policy and Waiver Status

Hawaii operates its Medicaid program through the Med-QUEST Division within the Department of Human Services. The current Section 1115 demonstration waiver, QUEST Integration, runs through early 2025 with CMS currently reviewing the renewal application. The waiver focuses on managed care delivery, social determinants of health integration, and behavioral health coordination rather than work requirements.

The state has not submitted or indicated intent to submit a waiver requesting early implementation of work requirements. Given Governor Josh Green's strong commitment to healthcare access, an early waiver seeking to impose requirements before the federal mandate takes effect appears unlikely.

Governor Green, a physician who spent 20 years practicing family medicine on the Big Island before entering politics, has positioned himself as a defender of the Medicaid safety net. In his 2025 State of the State address, he announced contingency planning: "The reason we left $1 billion in surplus each year is because we anticipate they may cut $300 million in Medicaid, which I will ask our team to continue to provide." He has specifically committed to protecting coverage for people with disabilities and stated willingness to use state funds to maintain coverage if federal changes threaten it.

The Green administration has emphasized healthcare access expansion rather than restriction. Recent policy achievements include exempting medical services under Medicare, Medicaid, and TRICARE from Hawaii's General Excise Tax, extending postpartum Medicaid coverage to 12 months, and adding adult dental benefits to Medicaid. The administration's policy trajectory suggests it will implement federal work requirements with maximum exemptions and minimum barriers rather than aggressive enforcement.

## Defining Characteristics

**Multi-Island Geography Creates Unprecedented Verification Challenges**

Hawaii's archipelago structure creates work verification challenges no other state faces. A Molokai resident working construction jobs on multiple islands must document hours across jurisdictions that lack seamless data sharing. An agricultural worker on the Big Island may have employment records scattered across small farms without sophisticated payroll systems. A tourism worker in Maui County affected by the 2023 wildfires may have experienced extended unemployment that complicates compliance demonstration.

Inter-island travel for verification appointments would impose extraordinary burdens. Flights between islands cost $120 to $320 and are frequently delayed or cancelled, particularly on Molokai and Lanai. No inter-island ferry system exists for most routes. Requiring a Molokai resident to travel to Honolulu for a verification appointment could consume an entire day and hundreds of dollars, assuming flights operate as scheduled.

The state's only Level 1 Trauma Center sits on Oahu, as do most specialist medical services. Medicaid enrollees on neighbor islands already face significant healthcare access barriers; adding administrative compliance requirements for work verification could compound existing disparities.

**COFA Migrant Population Presents Unique Documentation Challenges**

The Compact of Free Association migrant population represents a significant and vulnerable subset of Hawaii's Medicaid enrollment. COFA migrants from the Federated States of Micronesia, Republic of the Marshall Islands, and Republic of Palau can legally live and work in the United States but faced exclusion from Medicaid eligibility from 1996 until December 2020, when federal eligibility was restored.

This population experiences elevated rates of chronic disease, including conditions potentially related to historical U.S. nuclear testing in their home nations. Language barriers are significant; Chuukese, Marshallese, and other Pacific Island languages are common, and health literacy in English may be limited. Cultural differences in understanding bureaucratic requirements compound these challenges.

COFA migrants restored to Medicaid eligibility after 2020 have limited experience navigating American administrative systems. Work verification requirements will demand documentation from employers who may themselves struggle with complex payroll systems. Community-based organizations serving COFA populations will face significant capacity demands to provide navigation support.

**Managed Care Landscape**

Hawaii operates Medicaid almost entirely through managed care, with 77% of spending flowing through managed care organizations. Five MCOs serve the state: AlohaCare (community-based nonprofit), HMSA (Blue Cross Blue Shield affiliate, largest market share at approximately 47%), Kaiser Permanente (available only on Oahu and Maui), Ohana Health Plan (Centene subsidiary), and UnitedHealthcare Community Plan.

The concentration of two locally-based nonprofits (AlohaCare and HMSA) alongside three national for-profit carriers creates a hybrid market. Local plans have deeper community relationships and understanding of Hawaii's unique challenges; national carriers bring technology infrastructure and experience from other states implementing work requirements.

Kaiser's geographic limitation to Oahu and Maui means neighbor island residents have only four MCO options, and in practice may have fewer depending on provider network adequacy in their specific location. Work requirement verification systems must accommodate this geographic variation in managed care presence.

**Tourism Economy Creates Verification Complexity**

Hawaii's tourism-dependent economy generates employment patterns that complicate work verification. Hotel and restaurant workers may have variable schedules driven by seasonal visitor patterns and unpredictable events like the August 2023 Maui wildfires. Tour operators, activity providers, and retail workers in visitor-facing industries experience hours that fluctuate with tourism flows.

The gig economy has expanded in Hawaii as elsewhere, with rideshare drivers, delivery workers, and vacation rental service providers representing growing portions of the workforce. Self-employment in tourism-adjacent services often lacks traditional documentation; a worker providing tours or activities may have income without conventional paystubs.

The 2023 Maui wildfires devastated Lahaina and surrounding areas, destroying employment for thousands of workers in one of Hawaii's most tourism-dependent regions. Recovery continues, but many affected workers experienced extended unemployment followed by unstable employment as the area rebuilds. Work requirement implementation must accommodate these disaster-affected populations whose employment histories show disruption through no fault of their own.

## Expected Policy Posture and Implementation Approach

Hawaii will implement federal work requirements with maximum coverage protection. The Green administration's philosophical commitment to healthcare access, the governor's personal background as a physician, and the state's Democratic legislative supermajority all point toward implementation designed to minimize coverage loss.

Expected elements of Hawaii's approach include broad exemptions aggressively marketed to eligible populations, investment in automated verification using existing state data systems, cross-program coordination with SNAP and TANF work requirements where possible, and significant human navigation support for populations facing verification challenges.

The multi-island geography will require creative solutions. Telehealth-based verification appointments, partnerships with neighbor island community organizations to serve as verification submission points, and extended good cause exception policies for geographic barriers all represent likely components.

COFA migrant populations will require culturally and linguistically appropriate navigation services. Organizations already serving these communities, including Kokua Kalihi Valley and various island-specific nonprofits, may receive state support to expand navigation capacity.

The Prepaid Health Care Act creates an unusual cross-reference opportunity. Workers documented as meeting PHCA eligibility thresholds (20+ hours weekly) necessarily exceed work requirement thresholds. The state could potentially leverage employer PHCA reporting as a verification source, though this would require system development and regulatory coordination.

**Timeline Considerations**

Hawaii's compressed implementation timeline faces particular challenges. The state must build verification systems across seven inhabited islands, develop culturally appropriate outreach in multiple languages, and coordinate with MCOs that have varying geographic footprints. The neighbor islands' limited administrative capacity means implementation cannot simply replicate Oahu-centered approaches.

The ongoing Maui recovery complicates resource allocation. State agencies and community organizations already stretched by disaster response must simultaneously prepare for work requirement implementation. Whether federal flexibility accommodates Maui-specific disaster exemptions remains uncertain.

## Summary: What Hawaii Is Expected to Do

Hawaii will implement federal work requirements reluctantly, with maximum exemptions and minimum administrative barriers. Governor Green's administration will prioritize coverage retention over compliance enforcement, viewing work requirements as a federal mandate to be managed rather than an opportunity for program restructuring.

The state's multi-island geography creates unprecedented verification challenges that will require significant investment in neighbor island infrastructure. COFA migrant populations will require culturally appropriate navigation services that community organizations may struggle to scale without additional resources. Tourism economy volatility complicates documentation for workers whose hours fluctuate with visitor flows.

The Prepaid Health Care Act's employer mandate means Hawaii's expansion population differs structurally from mainland states. Those enrolled in Medicaid expansion are more likely to have employment patterns that fall outside traditional verification frameworks: part-time work below 20 hours weekly, self-employment, gig economy participation, or transitional unemployment.

Hawaii's managed care infrastructure provides implementation capacity, but geographic limitations mean some MCOs cannot serve neighbor island populations. The state will need island-specific implementation strategies that account for vastly different healthcare and administrative infrastructure across the archipelago.

The Green administration's contingency planning for Medicaid cuts suggests willingness to use state resources to maintain coverage if federal requirements prove unworkable. Hawaii's relatively small expansion population and strong fiscal position create space for state intervention that larger states cannot match. Whether this translates to state-funded coverage for those losing federal eligibility under work requirements remains to be determined, but the administration has signaled openness to such measures.

Hawaii's aloha spirit will be tested by work requirements designed without consideration of archipelago geography, Pacific Islander populations, or tourism-dependent economies. The state's response will demonstrate whether implementation creativity can accommodate circumstances federal policymakers did not anticipate.
