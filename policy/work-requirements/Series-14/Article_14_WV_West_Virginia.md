## Work Requirement History

West Virginia has no prior experience implementing Medicaid work requirements. The state considered pursuing a work requirement waiver in late 2017, and legislation (HB3136) was introduced in the 2019 legislative session but did not advance due to concerns from consumer advocates. Unlike neighboring Kentucky, which attempted work requirements through the HEALTH program before federal court intervention, West Virginia will approach the December 2026 implementation deadline without operational experience or institutional memory.

This absence of prior implementation creates both challenges and opportunities. The state lacks the systems, workflows, and trained staff that states like Michigan or Georgia developed through their earlier attempts. However, West Virginia also avoids the political complications that emerged in states where work requirements became contentious litigation targets. The state can learn from others' failures without bearing the scars of its own.

West Virginia was among the first states to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, with coverage effective January 1, 2014 under then-Governor Earl Ray Tomblin. Expansion enrollment exceeded projections substantially. State officials initially projected 91,500 enrollees; actual enrollment reached 245,000 by the end of 2022, outpacing projections by 93%. This enrollment success reflected both high need in the population and effective outreach, but also contributed to budget pressures that have made Medicaid a persistent political issue.

## Current Policy and Waiver Status

**Political Environment**

Governor Patrick Morrisey, who took office in January 2025, has publicly supported the federal work requirements as "good and necessary reform so that Medicaid is being used for temporary assistance and not a permanent entitlement." His administration has characterized concerns about coverage losses and hospital closures as "fake news" while emphasizing the Rural Health Transformation Program funding ($100 million annually for five years) as mitigation.

The state's congressional delegation, including Senator Jim Justice (formerly governor, switched from Democrat to Republican) and Senator Shelley Moore Capito, voted for the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Justice, who as governor in 2017 warned that Medicaid cuts would be "beyond catastrophic" for West Virginia families, now characterizes the legislation as striking "a good balance between protecting the most vulnerable and those who rely on the program while rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse."

The state legislature has pursued aggressive work requirements for other programs. Senate Bill 249, which would expand SNAP Employment and Training requirements to ages 18-59 (up from 18-54) and increase required hours to 30 per week, passed the Senate in 2025 and remains under consideration. This legislative posture suggests the state will not pursue maximum exemptions or accommodations in Medicaid work requirement implementation.

**Administrative Preparations**

State officials have begun preparation for January 2027 implementation. Commissioner Cindy Beane of the Bureau for Medical Services told legislators in October 2025 that she anticipates enrollment declines: "I don't know that everyone will be able to comply, or will comply with that. So I do anticipate some people coming off its rolls."

West Virginia has enlisted West Virginia University Health Affairs to assist with project management and systems requirements. The state is participating in a pilot program with seven other states to explore technology for automated work hour reporting. Beane described the goal as a "no touch solution so that people aren't constantly having to report their work hours."

CMS has communicated clearly that no extensions will be granted. Beane reported: "CMS has made it very clear... that basically there is no good faith waiver. They will be anticipating that you will be ready next January."

**Fiscal Pressures**

The state faces significant budget challenges that complicate Medicaid implementation. Governor Morrisey identified a projected $400 million deficit for fiscal year 2026, with Medicaid contributing $153 million through one-time funding sources he characterized as a "budget gimmick." West Virginia receives approximately 78% of its Medicaid funding from the federal government, making it among the most federally dependent states for the program.

The West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy estimates the One Big Beautiful Bill Act will cost the state up to $659 million in new direct budget costs through implementation. State Health and Value Strategies projects West Virginia will lose $6.6 billion in federal Medicaid funds over ten years. These fiscal pressures may push the state toward minimal investment in verification systems and navigator support rather than the comprehensive infrastructure that successful implementation would require.

## Defining Characteristics

**The Disability Challenge**

West Virginia's exceptionally high disability rate creates fundamental implementation challenges that other states will not face at comparable scale. With 19.5% of residents reporting disability and 7.2% of working-age adults receiving SSDI, the state has a population profile where work requirements will encounter medical barriers more frequently than in healthier states.

The legacy of coal mining has left generations of West Virginians with occupational injuries, black lung disease, and related conditions that qualify for disability exemptions. However, many individuals with significant functional limitations have not obtained formal disability determinations through SSI or SSDI. These individuals may have conditions that make 80 hours of monthly work impossible but lack the documentation that would trigger automatic exemptions. The gap between actual disability and documented disability will be a central implementation challenge.

**Rural Infrastructure Gaps**

West Virginia is one of the most rural states nationally, and its rural communities lack the infrastructure that successful work requirement implementation would demand. Forty percent of the state's rural hospitals are at risk of closure. Seven hospitals have been specifically identified as endangered: Logan Regional Medical Center, Welch Community Hospital, Broaddus Hospital Association, Minnie Hamilton Health Care Center, Grafton City Hospital, Jackson General Hospital, and Montgomery General Hospital.

The healthcare system that would need to document exemptions, provide medical verification, and support members navigating requirements is itself struggling for survival. Rural communities that lost hospitals have also lost the healthcare workforce that might serve as navigators or document qualifying activities. The same population decline that closed mines is closing clinics.

**The Opioid Recovery Intersection**

West Virginia has led the nation in overdose death rates for much of the past decade, though recent improvements have reduced deaths for the first time in years. Approximately 30,000 Medicaid members have an opioid use diagnosis. The state has invested substantially in medication-assisted treatment, with buprenorphine as the most common prescription (74%), followed by naltrexone (18%) and methadone (8%).

Individuals in active recovery face complex work requirement challenges. Treatment appointments, counseling sessions, and support group participation may not count toward qualifying activities depending on state implementation choices. Recovery itself requires stability that administrative burden threatens. The intersection of work requirements and substance use disorder recovery will affect a substantial portion of West Virginia's expansion population.

**Managed Care Landscape**

West Virginia operates the Mountain Health Trust managed care program, contracting with four MCOs: Aetna Better Health of West Virginia, The Health Plan, Highmark Health Options, and Wellpoint West Virginia. Approximately 47% of Medicaid spending flows through managed care. MCOs will bear significant responsibility for member outreach, verification support, and retention efforts.

The relatively consolidated MCO market (four plans statewide) may facilitate coordinated implementation if state policy encourages MCO investment in navigation. Alternatively, MCOs may adopt minimal compliance approaches if state contracts do not include performance metrics around work requirement retention.

## Expected Approach

West Virginia's implementation posture suggests a compliance-focused rather than coverage-maximizing approach. The state has not signaled interest in pursuing maximum exemptions, graduated requirements, or substantial investment in navigation infrastructure. Political rhetoric emphasizes work requirements as "reform" rather than as administrative challenges requiring accommodation.

Several implementation choices will determine outcomes:

**Exemption Policy:** The state must decide whether to pursue broad exemptions (medical conditions, caregiving, geographic isolation) or narrow interpretations. The high disability rate creates a natural case for generous medical exemptions, but the political environment suggests the state may resist expansive exemption categories.

**Verification Infrastructure:** The pilot program participation suggests interest in automated verification, which could reduce administrative burden if successful. However, the compressed timeline and budget constraints may result in minimal viable systems rather than comprehensive verification infrastructure.

**Navigator Investment:** West Virginia's charitable food network, community health centers, and advocacy organizations have capacity constraints that limit their ability to absorb navigation demand without additional funding. Whether the state will invest in navigator capacity or rely on MCOs and understaffed county offices remains unclear.

**Cross-Program Coordination:** SNAP Employment and Training operates separately from Medicaid with different requirements. The state has not indicated plans for automatic deemed compliance between programs. Members meeting SNAP work requirements may still need to document Medicaid compliance separately, creating duplicative burden.

**Cure Periods and Appeals:** The state's approach to deadline enforcement will significantly affect coverage losses. Generous cure periods with multiple notification attempts would reduce procedural disenrollments; aggressive enforcement would maximize losses among otherwise-eligible individuals.

## Cross-Program Context

**SNAP Employment and Training**

West Virginia operates a voluntary SNAP E&T program, though legislation to make participation mandatory has advanced in the legislature. Current SNAP ABAWD requirements affect ages 18-54 with 20-hour weekly requirements. The state does not currently align Medicaid and SNAP verification systems, creating potential for duplicative reporting requirements across programs.

Approximately 277,400 West Virginians participated in SNAP in fiscal year 2024 (approximately 16% of state population). Significant overlap exists between SNAP and Medicaid populations, but program coordination remains limited.

**TANF Work Requirements**

West Virginia Works (the state's TANF program) includes work requirements for cash assistance recipients. These requirements operate independently from Medicaid with separate verification systems.

**Provider Tax Structure**

West Virginia has moderate dependence on provider taxes for Medicaid financing. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act's restrictions on provider taxes will constrain state options for maintaining Medicaid financing as federal support declines.

**Rural Health Transformation Program**

Governor Morrisey has emphasized the Rural Health Transformation Program as mitigation for Medicaid cuts. The state expects to receive $100 million annually for five years and has submitted an application seeking additional funds. However, critics note that this funding cannot replace the billions in federal Medicaid funds the state will lose, and the program is designed for health system infrastructure rather than direct coverage.

**Marketplace Infrastructure**

West Virginia uses the federally facilitated marketplace (HealthCare.gov). Enhanced ACA subsidies currently make marketplace coverage affordable for many, but if subsidies expire as scheduled, marketplace options will become substantially more expensive for individuals who lose Medicaid coverage.

## Summary: What West Virginia Is Expected to Do

West Virginia will implement federal work requirements by January 2027 with what appears to be a minimal-investment, compliance-focused approach. The state's political leadership has embraced work requirements rhetorically while characterizing coverage loss projections as fear-mongering. Budget constraints and administrative capacity limitations will likely produce verification systems that meet minimum federal requirements without the redundancy and navigation support that would minimize coverage disruption.

The state's exceptionally high disability rate and substance use disorder prevalence mean that exemption determination processes will face high volume from the outset. Whether the state builds capacity to process exemptions efficiently or creates bottlenecks that result in procedural disenrollments will significantly affect outcomes.

Kaiser Family Foundation projects that approximately 60,000 West Virginians may lose coverage over the next decade under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act's provisions. State officials anticipate enrollment declines but have not specified projections or mitigation strategies.

West Virginia's implementation will provide important evidence about work requirements in high-disability, high-poverty, rural populations. If the state achieves compliance with minimal coverage loss, it will suggest that even minimalist approaches can function in challenging environments. More likely, West Virginia's implementation will illustrate the consequences of work requirements in populations where the underlying capacity to comply is limited by health conditions, geographic isolation, and economic circumstance.

The hospitals and healthcare systems serving West Virginia's rural communities are watching implementation closely. Coverage losses will translate directly to uncompensated care increases for facilities already operating at the margin. The same communities that lost coal jobs and population may lose their healthcare infrastructure as work requirements compound existing pressures.
