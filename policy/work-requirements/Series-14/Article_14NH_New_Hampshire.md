# Article 14.NH: New Hampshire
## When Systems Weren't Ready

New Hampshire offers a distinctive case study in work requirement implementation: a small, relatively affluent state with one of the nation's lowest unemployment rates, a severe opioid epidemic that Medicaid expansion helped address, and a 2019 work requirement attempt that collapsed before enforcement could begin. The state's experience demonstrates that even well-intentioned design cannot overcome inadequate implementation infrastructure, and that states must reckon with system readiness before imposing compliance demands on vulnerable populations.

The Granite Advantage program's work requirement attempt lasted barely four months before state officials acknowledged that approximately 17,000 residents faced imminent coverage loss, not because they weren't working but because they couldn't prove it. A federal court subsequently vacated CMS approval, joining the cascade of legal defeats that halted work requirements nationally. Now, with the One Big Beautiful Bill Act mandating federal work requirements by December 2026, New Hampshire confronts the same challenge with the benefit of hard-won experience and the burden of knowing how easily implementation can fail.

## State Profile

### Demographics

New Hampshire's Medicaid expansion population is small by national standards but significant for a state of 1.4 million residents. Approximately 60,000 adults are enrolled in the Granite Advantage Health Care Program, representing nearly 4% of the state's total population. The population skews younger than the national Medicaid expansion average, with roughly 30% under age 30. Gender distribution is approximately 52% female and 48% male.

The racial composition is among the most homogeneous of any expansion state. More than 90% of Granite Advantage enrollees identify as white, with small Hispanic, Asian, and Black populations concentrated primarily in the Manchester metropolitan area. This homogeneity simplifies some implementation challenges, as language access and cultural competency concerns are less acute than in more diverse states, but it also means New Hampshire's experience offers limited guidance for states with substantial minority populations.

### Geographic Characteristics

New Hampshire's geography creates a distinctive implementation landscape. The southern tier, anchored by Manchester and Nashua, contains the majority of the state's population and economic activity. Most Granite Advantage enrollees live within 60 minutes of major service centers, making the state's compact geography an implementation advantage compared to larger rural states.

However, the North Country presents a stark contrast. Coos County, the state's largest by area and smallest by population, has only 20 people per square mile compared to 775 per square mile in the southern tier. Population density decreases dramatically as one moves north, and with it, healthcare infrastructure, employment opportunities, and service access. The county has the state's highest poverty rate and the highest concentration of Medicaid recipients relative to population. Three critical access hospitals operated by North Country Health serve the entire region, and providers there have expressed grave concern about how Medicaid disruptions would affect their already fragile operations.

Public transportation is limited even in population centers. Manchester and Nashua have bus systems, but service is sparse and does not extend to suburban or rural areas where many expansion adults live and work. Someone without reliable personal transportation faces genuine barriers to employment verification appointments, educational programming, and service access that geographic proximity alone cannot solve.

### Economic Context

New Hampshire's labor market is among the tightest in the nation. The state's unemployment rate has hovered around 2.6-3.0% throughout 2025, ranking among the five lowest nationally. Labor force participation remains high despite pandemic-era declines, and employers across sectors report persistent worker shortages. Housing constraints have emerged as the binding limit on economic growth; workers cannot move to New Hampshire because housing is unavailable or unaffordable, and employers cannot expand because workers cannot be recruited.

This economic context fundamentally shapes the work requirement calculus. In states with high unemployment, work requirements may function as coverage restrictions because jobs simply aren't available. In New Hampshire, the challenge is different: jobs exist, but the question is whether Medicaid expansion adults can access them and whether work requirement infrastructure can verify their participation. The state's experience suggests that even abundant employment doesn't prevent documentation barriers from causing coverage loss.

Major industries include healthcare (the state's largest employer), manufacturing, retail, and tourism. Seasonal employment in the Lakes Region and White Mountains creates work patterns that may be difficult to document monthly. Someone working full-time during ski season or summer tourism peaks may have irregular hours during shoulder seasons. The gig economy has grown substantially, particularly in the southern tier, presenting the same verification challenges it does nationally.

New Hampshire's unique fiscal structure constrains implementation resources. The state has no income tax and no sales tax, relying instead on property taxes, business taxes, and fees. This creates structural limits on state spending capacity and has historically produced lean government operations. Building substantial work requirement infrastructure requires resources that New Hampshire's fiscal structure may not readily provide.

## The Substance Use Disorder Context

New Hampshire's opioid epidemic defines much of the policy context for work requirements. In 2017, the state's drug overdose death rate was second-highest nationally, with 424 opioid-related deaths in a state of 1.4 million people. The crisis touched every community, from affluent suburbs to struggling mill towns, creating political consensus around treatment access that cut across ideological lines.

Medicaid expansion played a central role in the state's response. Substance use disorder treatment advocates credit expanded coverage with enabling the infrastructure that has since bent the curve on overdose deaths. The state invested federal opioid response grant funding in a statewide Doorways program that provides single points of entry for people seeking substance use services in nine regions across the state. Help is designed to be less than an hour away for any resident. Since 2019, the Doorways have served more than 37,000 individuals seeking treatment.

The results have been dramatic. Drug deaths fell 33.4% from 2023 to 2024, the largest single-year decrease in over a decade. Preliminary 2025 data shows continued improvement. Governor Kelly Ayotte has touted New Hampshire as a national model for addressing the drug crisis through coordinated enforcement and treatment approaches. The state has invested more than $834 million in substance use disorder prevention, treatment, and recovery services, with 73% from federal sources, 22.5% from state funds, and the remainder from opioid settlement dollars.

The Recovery Friendly Workplace initiative, launched in 2018, represents another distinctive New Hampshire innovation. The program helps employers create supportive environments for workers in recovery, providing training on stigma reduction, supportive policies, and connections to treatment resources. More than 300 New Hampshire workplaces representing over 83,000 employees participate. The initiative recognizes that employment stability supports recovery while recovery fragility can undermine employment, a dynamic that work requirements must accommodate rather than disrupt.

This context makes substance use disorder exemptions particularly critical for New Hampshire. One in three Medicaid expansion recipients accesses mental health or substance use disorder services. Any work requirement design that destabilizes treatment engagement would undermine years of investment in the state's most successful public health initiative. The federal requirement's SUD exemption provisions will be among the most closely watched aspects of New Hampshire's implementation.

## The 2019 Implementation Attempt

### Design and Intent

New Hampshire's 2019 work requirement represented what the state believed was a thoughtful, barrier-conscious approach. The Granite Advantage program imposed a 100-hour monthly work requirement, 20 hours above the federal floor that would later appear in the Limit, Save, Grow Act and ultimately the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The higher threshold reflected the state's philosophical commitment to reciprocal obligation but created a more demanding standard than other states pursued.

The state designed what it called a "no-wrong-door" reporting approach, intending that beneficiaries could verify compliance through multiple channels rather than being locked into a single portal. This was explicitly informed by Arkansas's failures, where online-only reporting had contributed to mass coverage losses. New Hampshire believed it had learned from Arkansas and built a more accessible system.

Exemptions existed for pregnant women, primary caregivers, people with disabilities, those in substance use disorder treatment, full-time students, and people in areas with unemployment rates exceeding 10%. The exemption framework was relatively comprehensive by the standards of early work requirement designs. The state anticipated that many enrollees would qualify for exemptions or would easily demonstrate work participation.

### Implementation Collapse

Implementation began in June 2019 with beneficiaries required to begin reporting work activities. Within the first month, state data revealed a troubling pattern. Of approximately 50,000 expansion adults enrolled in Granite Advantage, about 25,000 were subject to requirements after automatic exemptions were applied. Of those 25,000, only about 8,100 had successfully documented compliance as of July. Nearly 17,000 residents faced potential coverage loss.

Governor Chris Sununu extended the compliance deadline to September 30, 2019, acknowledging that the large number of beneficiaries who had not reported reflected system failures rather than actual non-compliance. The state was not planning to impose penalties until after that date. But in July 2019, the same federal district court that had struck down Arkansas's work requirements vacated CMS approval of New Hampshire's program. The state's implementation was permanently halted.

The pattern that emerged before the court ruling echoed Arkansas precisely: the vast majority of those who hadn't reported were likely working or qualified for exemptions but couldn't navigate the verification system. The "no-wrong-door" design intent had not translated into accessible implementation. Information systems were delayed. Enrollment churn created confusion even before enforcement began. Provider uncertainty about program continuation undermined the stability that treatment providers and employers needed to support compliance.

### Legal Challenge and Resolution

The Philbrick v. Azar lawsuit, filed in March 2019 by the National Health Law Program, New Hampshire Legal Assistance, and the National Center for Law and Economic Justice, challenged CMS's approval of Granite Advantage's work requirements. The plaintiffs argued that CMS had exceeded its authority because work requirements did not advance Medicaid's core objective of providing health coverage to low-income populations.

Judge James Boasberg, the same judge who had ruled against Arkansas and Kentucky work requirements, found that CMS had failed to consider the program's predictable effect of causing coverage losses. The court noted that New Hampshire's own projections showed coverage would remain stable, but comments in the public record had detailed likely harm that CMS did not adequately address. The ruling cited evidence from SNAP work requirements in New Hampshire itself: when work requirements were reinstated in 2012, SNAP participation dropped by 5,480 adults within a year.

The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court's ruling in May 2020, citing its reasoning in the companion Gresham v. Azar case involving Arkansas. The Supreme Court ultimately remanded the case following the Biden administration's withdrawal of work requirement approvals nationally. CMS formally withdrew New Hampshire's authority to implement work requirements in 2021, though the underlying waiver for the Granite Advantage program continued.

## Current Policy and Legislative Activity

Senate Bill 134, introduced during the 2025 legislative session, directed the Department of Health and Human Services to resubmit a Section 1115 waiver to CMS seeking authority to reinstate work requirements. The bill required waiver submission by July 1, 2025, with annual reporting to the legislature on implementation status. The bill passed the Senate but was tabled by a House committee amid uncertainty about federal requirements and implementation costs.

The fiscal note accompanying SB 134 acknowledged significant uncertainties. Implementation costs were estimated to exceed $2.5 million in fiscal years 2026 and 2027, though the actual impact would depend heavily on federal guidance and the final shape of requirements. The note observed that approximately 65% of New Hampshire Medicaid beneficiaries are already working, suggesting that the affected population may be smaller than gross enrollment figures imply but that documentation barriers could still cause substantial harm.

The passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in 2025 rendered state waiver activity largely moot for the core work requirement. Federal law now mandates 80-hour monthly requirements for expansion adults nationally, with implementation required by December 2026. New Hampshire's policy choices now focus on exemption design, verification approaches, and navigation infrastructure rather than whether to impose requirements at all.

Current projections suggest 17,000-19,000 Granite Staters could lose coverage under federal work requirements, consistent with the state's 2019 experience. The Urban Institute analysis underlying these estimates assumes documentation barriers will cause coverage loss among people who are actually working or exempt. New Hampshire's challenge is determining whether its second implementation attempt can avoid the failures of the first.

## Defining Characteristics for Implementation

### Small Scale as Double-Edged Sword

New Hampshire's small expansion population creates both opportunities and constraints. With 60,000 enrollees rather than millions, the state could theoretically provide intensive navigation support that larger states cannot afford. A comprehensive navigator program serving 60,000 people costs a fraction of what it would in Ohio or Pennsylvania. Personal outreach, individual case management, and proactive exemption identification become feasible at New Hampshire's scale.

However, the state's fiscal constraints and lean government philosophy may prevent exploiting this advantage. New Hampshire's no-tax structure limits the resources available for implementation infrastructure. Building a navigator corps, developing verification technology, training eligibility workers, and conducting outreach campaigns all require investment that the state may resist. The irony is that New Hampshire could implement work requirements successfully with adequate resources but may choose not to invest those resources.

### Tight Labor Market Dynamics

New Hampshire's extremely low unemployment rate changes the work requirement calculus in ways that may not be obvious. The policy justification for work requirements often emphasizes encouraging labor force participation among those who could work but don't. In a state with 3% unemployment, that population is vanishingly small. Nearly everyone who can work and wants to work is already working.

This means New Hampshire's work requirement will function primarily as a documentation requirement rather than a behavioral incentive. People will lose coverage not because they aren't working but because they can't prove it. The state's 2019 experience previewed this dynamic: the problem wasn't lazy beneficiaries refusing to work but inadequate systems preventing working people from demonstrating compliance.

The tight labor market also creates implementation complexity. Employers desperate for workers may be less willing to spend time verifying hours for Medicaid compliance. The administrative burden falls on workers who are already stretched thin by demanding jobs in a competitive market. Housing instability, driven by the same scarcity that constrains labor supply, can cause address changes that disrupt verification communications.

### Treatment Infrastructure Dependence

New Hampshire's investment in substance use disorder treatment infrastructure creates both opportunities and risks. The Doorways program provides an existing network that could support work requirement navigation. Doorway staff already help people access treatment and navigate administrative systems. Extending their role to include work requirement support would be a natural evolution.

However, any coverage disruption threatens to destabilize this infrastructure. Treatment providers depend on Medicaid reimbursement for financial viability. If work requirements cause significant disenrollment, providers will see revenue declines that could force service reductions or closures. People in recovery may lose coverage precisely when they need treatment most. The fragile early recovery period, when administrative stress can trigger relapse, coincides with the period when work requirements impose the greatest documentation burden.

The federal work requirement includes exemptions for people in substance use disorder treatment, but accessing exemptions requires documentation that people in active use or early recovery may struggle to provide. Treatment providers will need to become adept at exemption documentation, and systems will need to recognize that proving treatment engagement may be difficult for people whose cognitive function is still recovering from substance use.

### Rural North Country Vulnerability

Coos County and the broader North Country face work requirement challenges that differ from the southern tier. Employment options are limited; someone may work seasonal tourism jobs that don't provide consistent monthly hours. The single largest employer complex, North Country Health, operates critical access hospitals that serve populations no other facility can reach.

Approximately 17% of all New Hampshire Medicaid recipients live in Coos County despite the county comprising only 2% of the state's population. This concentration reflects both the region's poverty and its age structure. Coverage disruptions would affect North Country Health's financial stability, potentially threatening the only hospital services available to residents who may be hours from the next nearest facility.

Internet access remains spotty in northern New Hampshire, making online verification systems less accessible than in urban areas. Some residents lack reliable cell service. The Doorways program in the region operates from Littleton Regional Healthcare, but residents in the far north may still face substantial travel to access in-person services. Paper-based and phone-based verification options become essential for reaching this population.

## Cross-Program Context

New Hampshire's small scale limits cross-program coordination opportunities. SNAP Employment and Training operates at modest scale, and TANF caseloads are minimal. However, the state's experience with SNAP work requirements provides a cautionary precedent. When SNAP work requirements were reinstated in 2012, enrollment dropped substantially. The same documentation barriers that affected SNAP will affect Medicaid.

The state operates a state-based health insurance exchange, which provides infrastructure for coverage transitions if people lose Medicaid eligibility. Unlike states relying on the federal marketplace, New Hampshire has direct control over exchange operations and can potentially create smooth handoffs for people who lose Medicaid but qualify for subsidized marketplace coverage. However, premium costs and coverage gaps during transition periods can still cause harm even with functional exchange infrastructure.

Provider tax dependence is moderate in New Hampshire. The state uses provider assessments to fund a portion of its Medicaid match, but not to the extent that some states do. Changes to provider tax rules in federal legislation will affect state Medicaid financing, though perhaps less dramatically than in states with higher provider tax dependence. Rural hospital financial fragility in the North Country means even moderate revenue disruptions could have outsized effects on care availability.

## What New Hampshire Will Need to Do

New Hampshire will implement federal work requirements by December 2026 with lessons from its failed 2019 attempt. The state's small population creates potential for intensive support that could prevent documentation-driven coverage loss, but fiscal constraints and political philosophy may prevent the investment needed to realize that potential.

Substance use disorder treatment protection will be the implementation's most distinctive feature. The state's significant progress in addressing the opioid epidemic depends on maintained treatment access. Exemption processes must be designed so that people in treatment can prove it without destabilizing their recovery. Treatment providers must be equipped to document exemption eligibility. Relapse must be recognized as part of chronic illness management, not as grounds for coverage termination.

The state's tight labor market means the work requirement will function as a documentation test rather than an employment incentive. Implementation success will be measured not by whether people start working but by whether working people can navigate verification systems. New Hampshire's 2019 experience demonstrated that even good design intent cannot overcome inadequate implementation infrastructure.

Rural North Country residents face particular vulnerability. Geographic isolation, limited internet access, seasonal employment patterns, and healthcare infrastructure fragility compound the documentation challenges. Verification systems must accommodate paper and phone reporting. Exemptions must recognize that living in a high-unemployment, low-opportunity area creates barriers that individual effort cannot overcome.

The state that learned its systems weren't ready in 2019 now has 14 months to ensure they're ready for 2026. Whether New Hampshire invests adequately in implementation infrastructure will determine whether its second work requirement attempt produces better outcomes than its first. The research community that documented failures nationally will be watching New Hampshire's implementation closely, knowing that the state's experience will inform assessments of whether work requirements can ever be implemented without causing coverage loss among people who should retain coverage.
