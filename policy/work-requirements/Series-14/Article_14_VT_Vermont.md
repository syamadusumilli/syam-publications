## Work Requirement History

Vermont has no prior experience with Medicaid work requirements. The state never applied for a Section 1115 waiver to impose community engagement conditions, and the Democratic-controlled legislature has historically opposed such policies. Vermont expanded Medicaid two decades before the Affordable Care Act, making it one of the earliest states to provide coverage to low-income adults. This history of coverage expansion rather than restriction shapes the state's orientation toward federal work requirement mandates.

The state has invested instead in alternative approaches to promoting employment and health. The Vermont Blueprint for Health, established in 2008, integrated primary care practices with community health teams to address social determinants of health and employment barriers. This infrastructure positioned Vermont differently than states that have approached work through punitive eligibility conditions.

## Current Policy and Waiver Status

**Political Landscape**

Vermont presents a unique political configuration. The state voted 63.8% for Vice President Harris in 2024, making it among the most Democratic states in the nation. The legislature maintains Democratic supermajorities in both chambers. Yet Governor Phil Scott, a Republican elected to his fifth term in 2024 by the largest margin since 1946, governs as a moderate focused on fiscal restraint and economic development.

Governor Scott has not publicly advocated for work requirements and has prioritized healthcare cost containment through system reform rather than eligibility restrictions. His relationship with the Democratic legislature creates an unusual dynamic: a Republican executive in a deeply progressive state where ideological conflict focuses on spending and taxation rather than Medicaid eligibility philosophy.

**State Response to Federal Mandate**

The Department of Vermont Health Access (DVHA) established a dedicated webpage on federal Medicaid changes following passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The agency acknowledges the January 2027 effective date for community engagement requirements and has communicated that many changes will not take effect until 2027 or later, allowing time to review details, await federal guidance, and communicate changes to enrollees.

State officials have been notably candid about anticipated impacts. Ashley Berliner, Director of Medicaid Policy for the Agency of Human Services, estimated that approximately 30,000 Vermonters will lose coverage due to administrative burden associated with work requirement verification. This figure represents roughly half of the adult expansion population and is based on historical experience showing a 50% non-response rate when additional documentation is required.

"When you ask people for additional information, they don't fill it out and they fall off. The burden becomes too high and coverage is lost," Berliner explained. State officials have stated that federal policymakers are "relying on the dropoff to help facilitate their proposed cuts."

**Current Waiver Status**

Vermont operates under the Global Commitment to Health Section 1115 demonstration waiver, approved through December 31, 2027. This waiver enables the state's unique Medicaid managed care-like delivery system where DVHA operates as a public managed care entity rather than contracting with commercial managed care organizations. The demonstration supports home and community-based services, pilot programs, and innovations designed to maintain quality while controlling costs.

The state will need to amend this waiver or submit a separate application to implement federal work requirement provisions while maintaining its distinctive delivery system structure.

## Defining Characteristics

**Fee-for-Service Managed Care Model**

Vermont operates one of the most distinctive Medicaid delivery systems in the nation. Rather than contracting with commercial managed care organizations, the Department of Vermont Health Access functions as a public managed care entity delivering services through fee-for-service arrangements with providers statewide. This approach gives the state direct operational control but means no MCO infrastructure exists to distribute implementation burden.

Work requirement implementation will require state staff and systems to perform functions that MCOs handle in other states: member outreach, compliance tracking, verification processing, exemption determination, and appeals management. Vermont's administrative capacity is sized for a population of 648,000, not the 18.5 million expansion adults facing work requirements nationally.

**OneCare Vermont Wind-Down**

The Vermont All-Payer ACO Model, a pioneering effort to align Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial payment under accountable care arrangements, is concluding at the end of 2025. OneCare Vermont, the accountable care organization at the center of this model, announced plans to wind down operations after nearly a decade of operation.

This timing creates organizational transition precisely when work requirement implementation demands maximum coordination capacity. The ACO had established connections with primary care practices, hospitals, and community organizations across the state. Those relationships enabled care coordination and population health management that could have supported member navigation of work requirements. Whether alternative infrastructure emerges before December 2026 remains uncertain.

The state is participating in the federal AHEAD Model (States Advancing All-Payer Health Equity Approaches and Development), which could provide framework for continued payment reform. However, the operational capacity OneCare provided will not be immediately replicated.

**Healthcare System Fragility**

Vermont's healthcare system operates under significant financial strain. The Green Mountain Care Board has documented deteriorating hospital financial health, particularly among rural facilities. Healthcare costs in Vermont are among the highest in the nation; the average lowest-cost Silver plan premium is more than twice the national average.

Thirteen of Vermont's fourteen hospitals received Medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments in state fiscal year 2024. Eight hospitals are designated as Critical Access Hospitals, reflecting their essential role in serving rural populations with limited alternatives. Coverage losses from work requirement implementation would increase uncompensated care at facilities already operating at financial margins.

The state has applied for funding through the Rural Health Transformation Program created by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, seeking at least $500 million over five years to support healthcare infrastructure. This application reflects both the vulnerability of Vermont's healthcare system and state officials' pragmatic approach to securing available federal resources even from legislation they oppose.

**Navigation Infrastructure**

Vermont maintains several programs positioned to support work requirement navigation, though none are sized for the scale of outreach the mandate requires. Working Bridges, a partnership between United Way and employers, helps working individuals access resources for employment stability. The Office of the Health Care Advocate at Vermont Legal Aid provides free assistance to Vermonters navigating coverage issues. Eleven Federally Qualified Health Center organizations operate approximately 60 primary care and 17 dental care sites across all 14 counties.

These organizations will face the frontlines of work requirement implementation, but they were designed for current enrollment support, not mass compliance verification for 65,000 expansion adults.

**Provider Tax Vulnerability**

Vermont utilizes provider taxes at the maximum rate permitted under federal law to leverage additional federal Medicaid matching funds. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act includes provisions that would reduce the permissible provider tax rate by 2.5% between 2028 and 2032, resulting in approximately $211 million in cumulative losses for Vermont counting both reduced state revenue and foregone federal matching.

This fiscal constraint will limit the state's ability to fund implementation infrastructure and absorb coverage losses. Hospital systems that currently support Medicaid through provider tax contributions will simultaneously face reduced Medicaid payments and increased uncompensated care from coverage losses.

## Projected Approach

**Coverage Protection Orientation**

Vermont's stated approach emphasizes helping eligible Vermonters maintain coverage rather than enforcing compliance. State officials have framed the challenge as ensuring people who are working can successfully document that status, not as identifying people who should lose coverage for failing to work.

DVHA's public communications emphasize that 75% of Medicaid adults in Vermont are already working. The verification challenge, not work behavior, will determine outcomes. State officials have committed to system modernization, technological improvements, and partnership with the Agency of Digital Services to support enrollment stability.

**Implementation Challenges**

Vermont faces distinctive challenges that its small size amplifies rather than mitigates:

*Administrative Scale:* The 65,000 expansion adults subject to work requirements represent a population that larger states could address through dedicated compliance units. Vermont's DVHA must implement verification systems while continuing all existing functions with limited staff.

*Technology Infrastructure:* State officials have acknowledged that legacy systems may not support the verification complexity work requirements demand. The comparison to DMV experiences with state systems reflects candid assessment of implementation barriers.

*Rural Outreach:* With two-thirds of residents in rural areas and 58% of Medicaid enrollees in rural communities, reaching people for documentation collection and compliance support requires approaches that work without urban density.

*Seasonal Employment:* Vermont's economy includes substantial seasonal variation tied to tourism, agriculture, and construction. Enrollees may meet annual hour thresholds while falling short in individual months, creating cliff effects that 80-hour monthly requirements do not accommodate.

**Timeline**

- October 2026: Immigration eligibility changes take effect
- January 2027: Work requirements effective for expansion adults
- 2027 and beyond: Semi-annual redetermination cycle begins

## Cross-Program Context

**SNAP Alignment**

Vermont administers SNAP with work requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents, though the state has historically sought waivers where eligible. Integration of Medicaid and SNAP verification could reduce duplicative documentation burden, but systems are not currently designed for automatic deemed compliance.

**Marketplace Infrastructure**

Vermont operates Vermont Health Connect, a state-based health insurance marketplace. The robust marketplace infrastructure provides a theoretical coverage alternative for people losing Medicaid eligibility. However, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act's provisions reducing marketplace subsidies and tightening enrollment periods will limit this pathway. State officials note that people who fail work requirements may be ineligible for both Medicaid and marketplace subsidies, leaving "literally nowhere for them to go to get coverage."

**Provider Capacity**

The network of Federally Qualified Health Centers, Critical Access Hospitals, and Rural Health Clinics provides access points across rural Vermont. These providers serve as trusted community resources and potential verification support sites. However, provider capacity constraints and financial pressures limit their ability to absorb navigation functions beyond clinical care.

## Summary

Vermont approaches federal work requirements from a distinctive position: a small, rural, deeply progressive state with a moderate Republican governor, no MCO infrastructure, a healthcare system under financial strain, and a public Medicaid managed care model that places implementation burden directly on state government.

The state's candor about expected outcomes distinguishes Vermont's response. Officials have publicly projected that 30,000 of 65,000 expansion adults may lose coverage due to documentation barriers, based on historical 50% non-response rates. This transparency reflects both political opposition to work requirements and pragmatic preparation for implementation challenges.

Vermont's experience will test whether the smallest states can implement federal mandates designed at national scale. The absence of MCO intermediaries means DVHA must build verification infrastructure without partners that bear implementation responsibility elsewhere. The OneCare wind-down removes coordinated care capacity precisely when such capacity would support member navigation. Financial constraints from provider tax restrictions limit available resources for implementation investment.

The state's high baseline coverage rate (97% of Vermonters have insurance) and low uninsured rate reflect decades of policy investment in access. Work requirements risk reversing these gains in ways that burden a fragile healthcare system and limited state administrative capacity. Whether Vermont's navigation infrastructure and political commitment to coverage can mitigate projected losses will become visible only after implementation begins.
