## Work Requirement History

New Mexico has never implemented Medicaid work requirements and has consistently opposed such policies. The state's approach to Medicaid has emphasized expansion, simplified enrollment, and integration of physical, behavioral, and long-term care services under managed care.

**Centennial Care Development**

New Mexico's Medicaid program underwent significant transformation in 2014 when it became Centennial Care, coinciding with the Affordable Care Act's expansion provisions. Republican Governor Susana Martinez announced in January 2013 that New Mexico would participate in Medicaid expansion, describing it as "what is best for New Mexicans." Martinez was only the second Republican governor to accept expansion at the time.

Centennial Care merged multiple prior waivers into a comprehensive managed care model with three contracted managed care organizations (MCOs): Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Mexico, Presbyterian Health Plan, and Western Sky Community Care. In 2024, the program was renamed Turquoise Care and now includes four MCOs with the addition of United Healthcare Community Plan and Molina Healthcare of New Mexico.

The Centennial Care model emphasizes care coordination, with MCOs responsible for integrating physical health, behavioral health, dental, and long-term care services. Member incentive programs reward healthy behaviors and primary care utilization. This philosophy of supporting access and coordination stands in direct contrast to work requirement approaches that add compliance burdens.

**Provider Rate Investments**

Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham's administration has prioritized strengthening Medicaid infrastructure through provider rate increases. Since July 2024, more than 2,700 new providers have joined the Medicaid program following rate improvements to among the highest nationally. The Health Care Professional Loan Repayment Program now supports over 1,200 providers practicing in New Mexico, compared to just 22 six years ago.

These investments reflect a strategy of building provider capacity to serve the Medicaid population rather than reducing enrollment through compliance requirements.

## Current Policy and Waiver Status

**Political Landscape**

Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham (D) has been forcefully opposed to federal work requirements and Medicaid cuts. In response to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, she stated: "We're not going to stand by while Washington abandons New Mexico families." She convened a special legislative session in October 2025 specifically to address federal funding cuts affecting Medicaid and SNAP.

New Mexico's congressional delegation divides along predictable partisan lines, with Democratic Senators Martin Heinrich and Ben Ray LujÃ¡n strongly opposing the federal legislation and Democratic Representatives Teresa Leger FernÃ¡ndez and Gabe Vasquez fighting to modify harmful provisions. The state's political environment ensures implementation will be designed to minimize coverage losses.

**Special Session Response**

The October 2025 special session addressed immediate impacts of federal policy changes, including appropriating funds to cover SNAP benefits and maintain marketplace subsidies for populations losing federal support. The legislature passed temporary fixes through July 2026, with more comprehensive responses expected during the regular 2026 session.

Key concerns addressed included DACA recipients losing marketplace eligibility, populations facing new cost-sharing requirements, and the technology system upgrades needed for work requirement implementation.

**Technology and Administrative Preparation**

New Mexico's Health Care Authority estimates $24 million will be needed to update eligibility and enrollment systems to accommodate work requirement verification and the new six-month redetermination schedule. This represents a substantial investment in administrative infrastructure that serves no healthcare delivery purpose.

State Medicaid Director Kari Armijo has warned that any funding received from the federal Rural Health Fund will not replace the federal funding losses from other provisions of the reconciliation bill. The state is preparing for structural changes while openly acknowledging they will cause harm.

## Defining Characteristics

**Extreme Provider Shortage Context**

New Mexico faces among the most severe healthcare workforce shortages nationally. Thirty-two of the state's 33 counties are designated wholly or partially as health professional shortage areas. Only Los Alamos County, home to a national laboratory with a highly educated workforce, escapes this designation.

The state is projected to be short more than 2,100 physicians by 2030. As of mid-2025, approximately 1,000 physician positions and 7,000 nursing positions remained unfilled across the state. This shortage is concentrated in rural and frontier areas, where 96% of counties face primary care physician shortages.

Work requirements will be implemented against this backdrop of provider scarcity. Even if members comply with all requirements and maintain coverage, they may not be able to access care due to provider unavailability.

**Rural Hospital Vulnerability**

Federal Medicaid cuts threaten the viability of New Mexico's rural hospital infrastructure. The Lujan Grisham administration has warned that six to eight rural hospitals could close within 18 months of full implementation. Senate Budget Committee analysis identified 15 New Mexico hospitals in the top 10% nationally for Medicaid patient share, making them acutely vulnerable to coverage losses.

At-risk facilities include hospitals serving communities across the state: Alta Vista Regional Hospital in Las Vegas, Eastern New Mexico Medical Center in Roswell, Dr. Dan C. Trigg Memorial Hospital in Tucumcari, Lincoln County Medical Center in Ruidoso, Miners' Colfax Medical Center in Raton, and Mimbres Memorial Hospital in Deming, among others.

The state's $1.5 billion Healthcare Delivery and Access program, a cornerstone of hospital funding, faces elimination under federal provisions. This single cut would slash 10% of the New Mexico Medicaid budget.

**Tribal Population Complexity**

New Mexico's 23 federally recognized tribes are exempt from work requirements under federal law, but this exemption creates implementation complexity rather than simplifying administration. Tribal members who choose to remain on fee-for-service Medicaid rather than enrolling in managed care require separate administrative processes. Urban Native Americans not enrolled in federally recognized tribes may not qualify for tribal exemptions.

The state has developed strong government-to-government relationships with tribal nations, recently becoming one of four states approved to cover traditional health practices through Medicaid. CareOregon and other MCOs provide tribal care coordination programs. But the work requirement verification system must accurately identify and exempt tribal members across diverse enrollment categories.

Within tribal areas, employment rates are substantially lower than statewide averages due to limited economic opportunity on reservation lands. The employment-population ratio in tribal areas of 39.6% compared to 53.5% statewide reflects structural economic conditions rather than individual unwillingness to work. Geographic isolation, transportation barriers, and limited employer presence make meeting 80-hour monthly thresholds genuinely difficult regardless of individual motivation.

**Language and Literacy Considerations**

New Mexico is officially bilingual, with Spanish and English both used in government communications. Approximately 36% of the population speaks a language other than English at home. Beyond Spanish, tribal languages remain in active use in Pueblo, Apache, and Navajo communities.

Work requirement communications, reporting systems, and verification processes must function across multiple languages and literacy levels. The federal requirement for monthly reporting assumes administrative capacity that may not exist among populations with limited English proficiency or formal education.

## Expected Implementation Approach

New Mexico will implement federal work requirements with maximum exemptions and minimum administrative friction, designing systems to maintain coverage rather than maximize compliance enforcement.

**Likely Design Choices**

The Lujan Grisham administration will almost certainly pursue the most generous interpretation of federal flexibility. This includes quarterly rather than monthly reporting where permitted, automatic exemption identification using available data, and cross-program deemed compliance for individuals meeting SNAP work requirements.

The state's managed care infrastructure provides capacity for compliance support. MCOs already employ care coordinators who could assist members with documentation and reporting. Value-added services could be expanded to include employment navigation support.

**Coverage Loss Projections**

The Health Care Authority projects that approximately 89,000 New Mexicans will lose coverage due to work requirements, though advocacy organizations believe the actual number could be significantly higher, particularly in rural areas where work and volunteer opportunities are limited and transportation to qualifying activities is difficult.

Coverage losses will not be evenly distributed. Rural and frontier communities with limited formal employment will experience disproportionate impact. Populations with disabilities, including those not qualifying for categorical exemptions, will struggle with reporting requirements even when they qualify for exemptions on medical grounds.

**The Disability Rights Warning**

Disability Rights New Mexico has issued pointed warnings about work requirement impacts on people with disabilities. Their analysis highlights that work requirements fail people with disabilities not because they are unwilling to work, but because the policy ignores real-world barriers.

An individual with intellectual disability working 80 hours monthly may lose coverage simply because their disability prevents regular reporting of hours. A person with traumatic brain injury who qualifies for medical exemption may lose coverage because executive function impairments prevent completing exemption paperwork. These are not hypotheticals but real barriers faced by New Mexicans with disabilities.

## Cross-Program Context

**SNAP Work Requirements**

New Mexico began implementing expanded SNAP work requirements in January 2025 for able-bodied adults without dependents in designated areas. This early experience will provide data on compliance rates and administrative challenges before Medicaid requirements take effect.

Cross-program coordination between SNAP and Medicaid systems could allow deemed compliance for individuals meeting food assistance work requirements. The state is working with federal partners to ensure administrative alignment.

**Provider Tax Restrictions**

New Mexico utilizes provider taxes for Medicaid financing, channeling over $1 billion annually to hospitals through the Medicaid provider tax system. Federal restrictions on provider tax rates will reduce available matching funds, compounding the impact of direct Medicaid cuts.

In March 2025, the state began distributing enhanced funding to hospitals through provider tax mechanisms, but these gains will be partially reversed by federal limitations phased in through 2032.

**Rural Health Fund Application**

New Mexico has applied for $1 billion from the federal Rural Health Fund created by the reconciliation bill. The application, submitted before the November 2025 deadline, focuses on expanding rural healthcare workforce, improving access for rural patients, and supporting financial sustainability of rural providers.

However, state officials acknowledge that even full funding would not offset the estimated $8.5 billion in federal funding reductions over the next decade. The Rural Health Fund represents approximately one-third of estimated Medicaid cuts to rural areas nationally.

## Summary: What New Mexico Is Expected to Do

New Mexico will comply with federal work requirements while building systems designed to minimize coverage losses. The state's Democratic leadership, high Medicaid dependence, and severe provider shortages create powerful incentives to maintain enrollment.

The state's 42% Medicaid enrollment rate means work requirements will affect a larger share of the population than in any other state. Medicaid is not a marginal program in New Mexico; it is fundamental healthcare infrastructure covering more than one in three residents and paying for 55% of births.

Tribal exemptions will protect approximately 200,000 Native American residents, but the diverse tribal landscape creates administrative complexity. Urban Native Americans, those not enrolled in federally recognized tribes, and individuals with mixed heritage face ambiguous exemption status.

Rural and frontier areas face compounded challenges: limited formal employment, vast distances to qualifying activities, inadequate transportation, and the potential closure of the very healthcare facilities that coverage is supposed to access. The implementation paradox is stark: work requirements may succeed in reducing enrollment in areas where there are no providers to serve enrolled members anyway.

New Mexico's experience will test whether work requirements can function in a state with profound structural barriers to compliance. If a state with the nation's highest Medicaid dependence, most severe provider shortages, and largest rural population cannot make work requirements work without devastating coverage losses, it suggests the policy design itself is incompatible with the realities facing vulnerable Americans.
