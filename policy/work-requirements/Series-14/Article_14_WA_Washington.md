## Work Requirement History

Washington has no prior experience with Medicaid work requirements. The state was among the earliest to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, implementing expansion provisions beginning in 2011 through federal waiver authority, three years before full ACA expansion took effect in 2014. This early action reflected the state's political commitment to coverage expansion rather than conditional eligibility.

Washington never applied for a Section 1115 waiver to implement work requirements during either the first Trump administration or subsequent periods when CMS was approving such waivers. The state's Democratic political leadership consistently opposed work requirements as inconsistent with coverage goals.

The state's approach to Medicaid has emphasized removing barriers rather than adding conditions. Washington operates Apple Health through a streamlined eligibility process via Washington Healthplanfinder, the state-based marketplace that handles both Medicaid and commercial coverage enrollment. This integrated platform was designed to facilitate coverage transitions as income fluctuates, not to impose compliance monitoring.

## Current Policy and Waiver Status

**Political Landscape**

Governor Bob Ferguson (D) took office in January 2025, continuing more than four decades of Democratic gubernatorial leadership. Ferguson, previously the state's attorney general, has been among the most vocal critics of federal Medicaid changes enacted through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

Ferguson characterized the work requirement provisions as "devastating" and predicted at least 250,000 Washingtonians would lose Medicaid coverage. The Governor's office has committed to maintaining Medicaid eligibility for all Washingtonians who currently qualify under state law, though the state cannot override federal eligibility conditions for federally funded programs.

The state Legislature maintains Democratic control in both chambers, though budget constraints have created tensions. The state faced a projected $15 billion budget shortfall entering the 2025 legislative session, limiting capacity to backfill federal funding reductions.

**Federal Compliance Requirements**

Washington must implement work requirements by December 31, 2026, or apply for a waiver extending the deadline to December 31, 2028. The Health Care Authority, which administers Apple Health, is awaiting CMS guidance expected in 2025 before finalizing implementation approach.

State officials have indicated they will seek the extension waiver if available, providing additional time to build verification infrastructure. The compressed timeline represents a significant implementation challenge for a state that has never operated work verification systems for Medicaid.

**Legislative Action**

The 2025 legislative session produced no state-level work requirement legislation. Washington's Democratic majority has no appetite for implementing requirements earlier than federal law mandates or imposing more stringent provisions than the federal minimum.

Legislators flagged concerns during interim hearings about confusion surrounding the Apple Health brand, with many residents unaware that Apple Health is Washington's Medicaid program. This branding disconnect could prevent eligible individuals from understanding that new federal requirements apply to them.

## Defining Characteristics

**Administrative Structure**

Washington operates a state-administered Medicaid program through the Health Care Authority. Unlike county-administered states such as New York or California, eligibility determinations are centralized through state systems. This structure provides administrative consistency but concentrates implementation burden on state agencies.

The Department of Social and Health Services administers programs for aged and disabled populations. Washington Healthplanfinder, operated by the Washington Health Benefit Exchange, manages enrollment for working-age adults and families.

**Managed Care Landscape**

Apple Health operates through five statewide managed care organizations:
- Molina Healthcare of Washington
- Coordinated Care of Washington (Centene subsidiary)
- Community Health Plan of Washington (nonprofit, founded by community health centers)
- Amerigroup Washington
- UnitedHealthcare Community Plan (western Washington only)

Coordinated Care automatically enrolls all foster youth and former foster youth up to age 26, providing continuity for a population exempt from work requirements.

MCOs will bear significant responsibility for member retention under work requirements. Plans have financial incentive to prevent coverage losses among members who generate premium revenue. Community Health Plan of Washington, as the only nonprofit plan and one founded by safety-net providers, may take particularly aggressive approaches to member support.

**Tribal Coordination Infrastructure**

Washington's tribal coordination structure is among the most developed nationally. The American Indian Health Commission, a nonprofit representing 29 federally recognized tribes and two urban Indian health organizations, has worked with the Health Care Authority for decades on policy development.

The 1989 Centennial Accord established government-to-government relationships between Washington State and tribal governments, requiring meaningful consultation on policies affecting tribal communities. Work requirement implementation will require extensive tribal consultation, particularly given the federal exemption for tribal members.

Tribal 638 clinics and urban Indian health programs serve as essential providers for both Indian and non-Indian Medicaid enrollees in many communities. The Yakama tribal clinic in Toppenish and Colville health facilities provide critical access in underserved rural areas.

**Provider System Vulnerability**

Washington's hospital system has been described as "very fragile" following $3.8 billion in cumulative losses during 2022 and 2023. Eighty-five percent of the state's hospitals operated at a loss in 2023, creating minimal capacity to absorb additional financial pressure from coverage losses.

Fourteen rural hospitals have been identified at risk of closure or service reduction under the OB3 provisions, including facilities in Sunnyside, Toppenish, Moses Lake, Grand Coulee, and Forks. Providence's Inland Northwest system has been losing tens of millions annually and announced clinic closures in 2025.

The state relies substantially on provider taxes and state-directed payments to support hospital financing. Federal limits on these mechanisms, phasing in from 2028, will reduce payments by over $1.5 billion annually when fully implemented.

**Cross-Program Integration Potential**

Washington's legislative leaders have flagged opportunities to leverage existing SNAP and TANF work requirement compliance for Medicaid verification. The federal law provides deemed compliance for individuals already meeting work requirements under other programs.

Employment Security Department systems could be enhanced to verify employment and cross-check other benefit participation. However, no current data-sharing infrastructure exists specifically for Medicaid work verification purposes.

## Expected Implementation Approach

**Coverage-Protective Orientation**

Washington will implement work requirements with explicit focus on minimizing coverage losses. State officials have consistently framed the federal mandate as harmful policy imposed on the state rather than an opportunity for reform.

Expected design choices include:
- Maximum use of federal exemption categories
- Longest permissible look-back periods for income and employment verification
- Automatic deemed compliance for SNAP and TANF participants
- Verification at six-month redetermination rather than monthly reporting
- Multiple reporting channels (online, phone, mail, in-person)
- Extended cure periods before disenrollment

**Navigator and CBO Infrastructure**

Washington has existing infrastructure of enrollment assisters and navigators, though not at the scale required for work requirement verification support. Community health centers that founded Community Health Plan of Washington have historical relationships with underserved populations.

The state will need to build capacity for:
- Multilingual outreach in Spanish, Vietnamese, Somali, and other languages
- Tribal-specific communication and exemption processing
- Agricultural worker outreach during growing and harvest seasons
- Verification support for gig economy workers lacking traditional pay documentation

**Technology Development**

The Health Care Authority's eligibility systems were not designed for work verification. Building new functionality within 18 months (or 30 months if extension waiver granted) represents a substantial undertaking.

Washington has experience with eligibility system modernization through the Washington Connection and ProviderOne platforms, but work verification adds complexity that existing systems were never intended to handle.

**Timeline**

- 2025: Federal guidance awaited; waiver extension decision; initial planning
- Early 2026: System development; staff training; CBO capacity building
- Mid-2026: Member communications; reporting system activation
- December 2026: Federal work requirement deadline (or December 2028 if extension approved)
- January 2027: New six-month redetermination cycle begins for expansion adults

## Summary: What Washington Is Expected to Do

Washington will implement federal work requirements as a reluctant complier, designing systems to maintain coverage for the maximum number of enrollees consistent with federal law. The state has no political interest in aggressive enforcement and every financial incentive to prevent coverage losses that would shift costs to state-funded programs and hospitals.

The 620,000 expansion adults subject to requirements represent one of the largest affected populations nationally. State estimates project between 200,000 and 320,000 Washingtonians could lose coverage through work requirements and related provisions, though actual losses will depend on implementation design and compliance support infrastructure.

Washington's tribal coordination experience provides models for exemption processing that could inform broader implementation. The government-to-government consultation framework ensures tribal perspectives will shape system design.

The state's geographic diversity creates particular challenges. Urban Seattle populations have different employment patterns, documentation access, and service availability than Central Washington agricultural workers or isolated rural communities. Statewide policy must accommodate contexts ranging from Amazon headquarters to apple orchards to timber communities.

**Key Vulnerabilities**

Several factors may complicate Washington's implementation despite coverage-protective intentions:

Agricultural worker verification presents significant challenges. Yakima Valley's seasonal workforce, often paid in cash with limited documentation, faces barriers to demonstrating 80 hours monthly of qualifying activity. Language barriers compound documentation challenges for immigrant populations.

Hospital system fragility means coverage losses will accelerate financial distress for facilities already operating at the margin. Rural hospitals in Eastern Washington, where Medicaid enrollment is highest, are least able to absorb uncompensated care increases.

Budget constraints limit state capacity to backfill federal funding losses. The $15 billion budget shortfall constrains every state response option. Washington committed to covering the $11 million gap from Planned Parenthood defunding but acknowledged it cannot backfill all federal reductions.

MCO capacity to support members through compliance is untested. Plans have financial incentive to prevent disenrollment but limited experience with work verification support functions.

**Federal Relationship**

Governor Ferguson has positioned Washington as a leader in resistance to federal Medicaid changes, joining multistate litigation challenging data-sharing requirements and consistently criticizing the OB3 provisions. This adversarial posture may affect the state's ability to secure favorable waiver terms or implementation flexibility from CMS.

Washington's two Republican congressional representatives, Dan Newhouse and Michael Baumgartner, voted for the OB3 legislation. Their districts in Central and Eastern Washington have the highest Medicaid enrollment rates in the state, creating potential political accountability as implementation proceeds.

## Cross-Program Context

**SNAP Employment & Training**

Washington operates SNAP E&T programs that could provide deemed compliance pathways for Medicaid work requirements. Alignment between programs would reduce duplication for participants meeting requirements under both.

**TANF Work Requirements**

The WorkFirst program implements TANF work requirements for families receiving cash assistance. Infrastructure and staff expertise from WorkFirst could inform Medicaid implementation, though populations only partially overlap.

**Provider Tax Structure**

Washington relies substantially on hospital and nursing facility assessments to finance its Medicaid program. The federal limit reduction from 6% to 3.5% of net revenue, phasing in from 2028, will significantly constrain state financing capacity. State-directed payment reductions will remove over $1.5 billion annually from hospital payments when fully implemented.

**Marketplace Infrastructure**

Washington Healthplanfinder provides robust infrastructure for coverage transitions. Expansion adults losing Medicaid coverage may qualify for marketplace plans with subsidies, though the loss of enhanced premium tax credits in 2026 will reduce affordability. The state's Cascade Care Savings program provides state-funded subsidies for some marketplace enrollees.

**Immigration Provisions**

Federal changes to lawfully present non-citizen eligibility will affect over 30,000 current Apple Health enrollees. Washington's state-funded Apple Health Expansion program for undocumented immigrants provides alternative coverage but operates under enrollment caps due to budget constraints.
