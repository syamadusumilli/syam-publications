**Word Count Target:** 2,500-3,000 words

## State Profile

**Demographics**

Missouri presents a distinctive case in the work requirements landscape: a state where voters enshrined Medicaid expansion in the state constitution through a 2020 ballot initiative, explicitly prohibiting additional eligibility burdens like work requirements. That constitutional protection now collides with federal mandate. The ballot measure's language specifically prohibited "placing greater or additional burdens on eligibility or enrollment standards" for expansion adults than for other Medicaid populations. Federal work requirements supersede this protection, creating tension between voter intent and federal policy.

- Expansion adult population: approximately 327,000-355,000 (peaked at 355,465 in August 2025)
- Total Medicaid enrollment: approximately 1.27 million
- Percentage of state population on Medicaid: approximately 21%
- Among expansion adults, 44% work full-time, 20% work part-time, 12% are caregivers, 10% have illness preventing work, 7% attend school, and only 8% report not working for other reasons
- The federal government covers 90% of expansion costs; Missouri pays 10%
- Expansion enrollment has exceeded original projections of 275,000
- Approximately 32% of Missouri Medicaid recipients live in rural areas, substantially higher than the national average of 15.7%
- About one in four rural Missourians (23.8%) are enrolled in Medicaid, compared to 15.8% of urban residents

**Geographic Characteristics**

Missouri's 114 counties and the independent City of St. Louis create administrative variation across dramatically different regions. The state is largely rural: 99 of 115 county-level jurisdictions are classified as rural, though population concentrates in urban areas.

The St. Louis metropolitan area (St. Louis City, St. Louis County, and surrounding counties) contains approximately 35% of the state's population. The region includes substantial poverty concentration in St. Louis City and North County, alongside affluent suburban areas. Healthcare infrastructure is robust, with major academic medical centers.

The Kansas City metropolitan area (Jackson, Clay, Platte counties and Missouri side of metro) represents approximately 21% of state population. The region has growing healthcare infrastructure and serves as a bi-state metro with Kansas.

Springfield in southwest Missouri serves as the Ozarks' urban hub. The city anchors a region with significant poverty, limited employment opportunity, and health challenges including high rates of chronic disease and substance use disorder.

Columbia in central Missouri houses the University of Missouri and MU Health Care, creating an island of healthcare access in otherwise rural mid-Missouri. The recent closure of Audrain Community Hospital in Mexico (approximately 40 miles away) highlights regional healthcare fragility.

The Ozarks region in southern Missouri contains the highest poverty concentrations. Ozark County had a 29.6% poverty rate, the highest in the state. These counties face limited employment, transportation barriers, and healthcare access challenges that work requirements will exacerbate.

The Bootheel region in southeast Missouri (Pemiscot, Dunklin, New Madrid, Mississippi counties) resembles the Mississippi Delta economically and demographically. Agricultural employment dominates, with cotton, soybeans, and rice. Poverty rates are among the state's highest.

**Special Population Concentrations**

Missouri has limited tribal population. No federally recognized tribes with significant reservation land create the exemption pathways available in states like Arizona or South Dakota.

Agricultural workers in the Bootheel and central Missouri face seasonal employment patterns and informal employment arrangements that complicate hour verification.

The justice-involved population is significant. Missouri's incarceration rate remains above the national average. Reentry populations face employment barriers while navigating work requirements.

Substance use disorder prevalence is significant. Missouri has experienced substantial opioid epidemic impact, particularly in rural areas and the Ozarks. Methamphetamine remains a major concern. Medicaid expansion increased access to medication-assisted treatment; coverage losses could disrupt treatment continuity.

Refugee populations are present in St. Louis (significant Bosnian community, growing African refugee population) and Kansas City, creating language access and documentation challenges for work requirement compliance.

**Economic Context**

Missouri's economy shows substantial regional variation. Urban areas have diversified economies while rural regions struggle with limited opportunity.

- State unemployment rate: approximately 3.5-4.0% (substantial county variation; rural areas higher)
- Major industries: healthcare, manufacturing, agriculture, logistics, financial services, higher education
- Kansas City logistics hub (major rail and trucking center)
- St. Louis manufacturing and healthcare sectors
- Springfield healthcare and education
- Rural areas: agriculture, limited service sector
- State minimum wage: $12.30 per hour (increased through voter-approved ballot initiative)
- Significant gig economy presence in metropolitan areas

## Work Requirement History

Missouri has no prior Medicaid work requirement implementation experience. The state did not expand Medicaid until October 2021, and expansion only occurred because the Missouri Supreme Court ordered implementation after the legislature refused to fund the voter-approved constitutional amendment.

The 2020 ballot initiative specifically anticipated work requirements and prohibited them. Amendment 2's language stated that the expansion population could not face "greater or additional burdens on eligibility or enrollment standards, methodologies or practices" than other Medicaid populations. This provision was designed explicitly to prevent Missouri from following Nebraska and Utah, where legislators added work requirements to voter-approved expansions.

The constitutional protection reflected the Fairness Project's strategy of using constitutional amendments rather than statutes to prevent legislative modification. However, the framers could not anticipate federal legislation that would mandate work requirements regardless of state constitutional provisions.

Missouri's experience with SNAP work requirements provides some administrative context. The state operates SNAP ABAWD requirements through the Department of Social Services. However, Medicaid and SNAP operate through different systems without robust data sharing.

## Current Policy and Waiver Status

**Federal Mandate Acceptance**

Missouri's MO HealthNet Director Todd Richardson has indicated the state will implement federal work requirements by the December 2026 deadline. In interviews following OB3's passage, Richardson framed the state's goal as making compliance "as easy as possible" for enrollees while ensuring program integrity.

Richardson suggested the state could use existing wage data to verify employment for many enrollees without requiring individual reporting. "If they're working and we can verify that they're working through income data, then that's a verification right there," Richardson stated. He also mentioned potential use of online portals like SteadyIQ to streamline compliance documentation.

This framing suggests Missouri may pursue automated verification where possible, reducing individual reporting burden. However, the state's administrative capacity constraints create uncertainty about execution.

**Constitutional Tension**

Missouri's constitutional amendment protecting expansion from additional eligibility burdens does not override federal law. Federal work requirements will apply regardless of state constitutional provisions. However, the constitutional language may influence how aggressively Missouri implements requirements and whether the state uses available discretion to minimize compliance burden.

The constitutional protection could also affect state legislative action. The legislature cannot add additional restrictions beyond federal requirements without another constitutional amendment approved by voters. This prevents Missouri from pursuing the Tennessee model of extending work requirements to traditional Medicaid populations.

**MCO Landscape**

Missouri operates MO HealthNet Managed Care through three primary MCOs: Home State Health (Centene subsidiary), Healthy Blue (Anthem subsidiary), and UnitedHealthcare Community Plan. Home State Health serves over 300,000 enrollees and holds the specialized contract for foster children and adoption subsidy recipients.

MCO contracts are currently active through mid-2025 with pending amendments. How work requirement responsibilities will be allocated between the state Medicaid agency and MCOs remains undetermined. MCOs have experience with care coordination but limited experience with employment verification.

**Funding Cliff**

Missouri faces a separate crisis that intersects with work requirement implementation. The state has funded its 10% expansion share through temporary reserve accounts created with American Rescue Plan incentive funding. Those reserves are projected to be exhausted by late 2026, precisely when work requirements take effect.

If the legislature does not appropriate permanent funding for expansion, the state could face simultaneous implementation of work requirements and a funding crisis. Because expansion is constitutionally mandated, Missouri cannot simply end the program, but funding shortfalls could create operational chaos affecting work requirement implementation.

## Defining Characteristics

**Administrative Capacity Constraints**

Missouri's defining characteristic for work requirement implementation is well-documented administrative capacity limitations. The state has struggled for years to process Medicaid and SNAP applications in a timely manner. Federal law requires Medicaid applications be processed within 45 days; Missouri has averaged 70 days in recent periods.

The Family Support Division operates on outdated technology systems that advocates describe as "struggling." Work requirements will require processing proof of 80 hours of work, school, caregiving, or volunteering for hundreds of thousands of enrollees while conducting eligibility checks twice per year instead of annually.

"It really is going to be a new system to implement," observed Lucas Caldwell-McMillan of Empower Missouri. "Right now we've got a pretty outdated system that is struggling. I think the frontline agency staff are working their hardest to implement it now, but they're falling short."

This administrative capacity constraint is not philosophical opposition to work requirements; it is operational reality. Even if Missouri leadership wanted aggressive enforcement, the systems may not exist to execute it.

**Rural Hospital Vulnerability**

Missouri's 67 rural hospitals face severe financial pressure that work requirements will exacerbate. Twenty-one hospitals have closed in Missouri over the past decade, many in rural areas. No rural hospitals have closed since Medicaid expansion began, but coverage losses could reverse that stability.

Rural hospitals operate on average margins of 3.1%, with 44% having negative margins. They depend heavily on Medicaid reimbursement. The Missouri Foundation for Health estimates rural healthcare providers could lose 21 cents of every dollar they currently receive from Medicaid under OB3's combined provisions.

Work requirement-driven coverage losses concentrate disproportionately in rural areas where residents have limited internet access, transportation barriers, and irregular employment patterns that make compliance difficult. Rural Missouri could see both coverage losses and hospital closures compounding each other.

**Voter-Approved Expansion with Legislative Opposition**

Missouri's political dynamic is distinctive: voters approved expansion 53-47% in August 2020, but the Republican-controlled legislature refused to fund implementation. Only after the Missouri Supreme Court unanimously ordered implementation did enrollment begin in October 2021.

This creates an unusual situation where elected officials implementing work requirements do so against demonstrated voter preference for accessible Medicaid. Rural counties that would be most affected by work requirements voted heavily against expansion, but urban areas that supported expansion will see less impact due to better employment opportunity and internet access.

The constitutional protection prevents the legislature from adding additional restrictions, but Governor Mike Kehoe's administration will determine implementation approach within federal requirements. Whether that approach minimizes or emphasizes enforcement affects coverage outcomes.

## Expected Policy Posture and Timeline

**Anticipated Approach: Moderate with Automated Verification**

Missouri's expected approach appears moderate, emphasizing automated verification to reduce individual reporting burden. Several factors suggest this trajectory:

Director Richardson's statements indicate interest in using existing wage data to verify compliance without requiring individual documentation. This data-matching approach resembles Ohio's planned automated verification system.

The state's administrative capacity constraints may force simplified approaches regardless of policy preferences. Systems that cannot process applications in 45 days will struggle with monthly verification for hundreds of thousands of enrollees.

The constitutional protection, while not blocking federal requirements, may create political pressure to minimize implementation burden. Voters who approved expansion with explicit anti-burden language may react negatively to aggressive enforcement.

However, uncertainty remains substantial. The state must receive federal guidance on acceptable verification methods. Missouri's technology infrastructure may require significant investment to enable automated data matching. The funding cliff creates resource constraints that could limit implementation quality.

**Timeline**

- July 2025: OB3 enacted, federal work requirements mandatory
- Late 2025: CMS guidance expected; state planning begins
- 2026: System development, rulemaking, stakeholder engagement
- Late 2026: Reserve funds projected to be exhausted
- December 2026: Work requirements take effect

The timeline is aggressive for a state with documented administrative capacity limitations. Building verification systems, developing exemption processes, and training staff while simultaneously addressing a funding crisis creates compounded execution risk.

**Coverage Loss Projections**

Various estimates suggest between 130,000 and 170,000 Missourians could lose MO HealthNet coverage over the next decade due to work requirements and related OB3 provisions. This represents roughly one-third to one-half of the current expansion population.

Coverage losses would concentrate among rural residents with limited internet access, irregular employment, and transportation barriers preventing compliance documentation. The Ozarks, Bootheel, and other high-poverty rural regions face disproportionate impact.

## Summary: What Missouri Is Expected to Do

Missouri will implement federal work requirements for its 327,000-355,000 expansion adults despite state constitutional language prohibiting additional eligibility burdens. The federal mandate supersedes state constitutional protection, creating tension between voter intent and federal policy.

The state's approach appears likely to emphasize automated verification using existing wage data to minimize individual reporting burden. This approach reflects both administrative capacity constraints and constitutional context that discourages aggressive enforcement. Director Richardson has framed the goal as making compliance "as easy as possible" while maintaining program integrity.

Coverage loss projections suggest 130,000-170,000 Missourians could lose Medicaid over the next decade. Losses would concentrate disproportionately in rural areas where one in four residents depends on Medicaid and where administrative barriers to compliance are highest.

Missouri's administrative capacity limitations are documented and severe. A state that cannot process Medicaid applications within federal timelines faces substantial challenges implementing work verification for hundreds of thousands of enrollees with semiannual eligibility checks.

The simultaneous funding cliff, with reserve accounts exhausted by late 2026, compounds implementation challenges. Missouri may face work requirement implementation alongside a funding crisis, with neither issue resolved and both affecting operational capacity.

Rural Missouri, with the highest Medicaid dependence rates and most vulnerable hospital infrastructure, will test whether work requirements can be implemented without devastating rural healthcare access. The 67 rural hospitals operating on thin margins cannot absorb substantial increases in uncompensated care that coverage losses would create.

Missouri offers a test case for work requirement implementation in a state with constitutional protection that federal law overrides, documented administrative capacity limitations, and disproportionate rural vulnerability. Whether automated verification approaches can minimize coverage losses while meeting federal requirements depends on technology investments and implementation choices not yet made.

## Cross-Program Context

**SNAP Coordination Potential**

Missouri operates both SNAP and Medicaid through the Department of Social Services, creating theoretical coordination opportunity. Both programs have work requirements for some populations. An enrollee meeting SNAP ABAWD requirements could potentially be deemed compliant for Medicaid.

However, the programs currently operate on separate systems without robust data sharing. Building cross-program verification would reduce duplicative burden but requires system integration that does not currently exist at scale.

Director Richardson mentioned potential use of SNAP compliance data for Medicaid verification, suggesting the state recognizes coordination opportunity. Execution depends on technology investment the state has not yet committed.

**Provider Tax Dynamics**

Missouri relies on hospital assessments to help fund Medicaid. OB3's provider tax caps could affect Missouri's financing model. Senator Josh Hawley has introduced legislation attempting to exempt existing provider tax arrangements, but its fate remains uncertain.

The Missouri Hospital Association supports Medicaid expansion and opposes coverage losses that would increase uncompensated care. Hospital advocacy may influence implementation approach, pushing toward navigation support rather than aggressive enforcement.

**Marketplace Infrastructure**

Missouri operates on the federally facilitated marketplace. Expansion adults losing Medicaid may qualify for marketplace coverage with premium tax credits, though the December 2025 expiration of enhanced ACA subsidies creates uncertainty about affordability.

Cover Missouri provides navigator assistance for Medicaid and marketplace enrollment. This infrastructure could support transitions for those losing Medicaid eligibility, but navigator capacity is limited relative to potential population affected.

**Workforce Development Context**

Missouri operates workforce development programs through multiple agencies. MoExcels provides employer-driven workforce training. Jobs for America's Graduates (JAG-Missouri) serves youth populations. These programs could theoretically support work requirement compliance through qualifying activities.

However, workforce development programs are not currently integrated with Medicaid eligibility systems. Whether the state builds connections enabling workforce participation to count toward compliance depends on implementation design decisions.
