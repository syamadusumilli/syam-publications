## Work Requirement History

Kentucky has the most contentious work requirement history of any state, with policy reversals driven by gubernatorial elections and federal court decisions creating whiplash for the expansion population.

**Kynect: The Success Story**

Before work requirements became the focus, Kentucky achieved remarkable Medicaid enrollment success. Governor Steve Beshear (D) accepted Medicaid expansion in 2013 and created Kynect, a state-based health insurance marketplace that became a national model for enrollment.

Between 2013 and 2016, Kentucky's uninsured rate dropped from 20.4% to 7.5%, the largest decline of any state. Approximately 440,000 Kentuckians gained coverage through expansion. Health outcomes improved measurably: cancer screenings increased, chronic disease management improved, and access to care expanded dramatically.

The enrollment infrastructure worked. Kynect navigators, simplified applications, and community partnerships achieved what other states struggled to accomplish.

**Kentucky HEALTH: The Bevin Reversal**

Governor Matt Bevin (R), elected in 2015, opposed Medicaid expansion philosophically but recognized that reversing coverage for 440,000 Kentuckians was politically impossible. Instead, he pursued conditioning coverage on work requirements.

The Kentucky Helping to Engage and Achieve Long Term Health (HEALTH) waiver, submitted in 2016 and approved by CMS in January 2018, included:

- 80 hours monthly of qualifying activities (work, education, job training, community service)
- Monthly premiums for members above poverty
- Lockout penalties for non-compliance (six months for premium non-payment, until end of year for work requirement failure)
- My Rewards accounts (health savings account structure similar to Indiana's POWER)
- Elimination of non-emergency transportation and vision/dental benefits

CMS projected 95,000 Kentuckians would lose coverage under Kentucky HEALTH.

**Stewart v. Azar: The First Strike**

In June 2018, Judge James Boasberg struck down CMS approval of Kentucky HEALTH. The same judge who would later invalidate Arkansas's work requirements found that HHS failed to consider whether Kentucky HEALTH would further Medicaid's central objective of providing coverage to low-income populations.

The court found the Secretary's approval "arbitrary and capricious" because it did not adequately address the projected coverage losses. Kentucky appealed while simultaneously resubmitting a modified waiver.

**The Second Approval and Second Strike**

CMS re-approved Kentucky HEALTH in November 2018 with modest modifications. Advocacy groups challenged again. In March 2019, Judge Boasberg vacated the second approval on the same grounds: HHS still had not adequately considered how the waiver would affect coverage.

Kentucky HEALTH never took effect. The state had invested years of administrative effort, millions in system development, and substantial political capital, but never enrolled a single member under work requirements.

**Beshear Return: Policy Whiplash**

Andy Beshear (D) defeated Bevin in November 2019, running partly on healthcare. Beshear withdrew the Kentucky HEALTH waiver in December 2019, ending the work requirement pursuit.

The COVID-19 pandemic beginning March 2020 triggered continuous enrollment, providing stability after years of policy uncertainty. Kentucky's expansion population remained covered without work conditions.

**Current Political Reality**

Beshear won reelection in 2023, but Kentucky's legislature remains firmly Republican. The legislature has repeatedly passed work requirement legislation that Beshear vetoed. The federal mandate under OB3 changes this dynamic: work requirements will take effect regardless of gubernatorial preference.

## Current Policy and Waiver Status

**Legislative-Executive Tension**

Kentucky presents a unique political situation: a Democratic governor who opposes work requirements facing a Republican legislature that enthusiastically supports them, with federal law now mandating implementation.

House Bill 7, passed in the 2024 legislative session, directed the Cabinet for Health and Family Services to implement work requirements aligned with federal specifications. Governor Beshear vetoed the bill; the legislature overrode his veto. The state is now legally required to pursue implementation.

**Waiver Application Status**

Kentucky submitted its Section 1115 waiver amendment in March 2025. The application reflects the governor's preference for minimizing harm within federal constraints:

*Broad Exemption Categories:* The application includes exemptions beyond federal minimums: pregnancy through 12 months postpartum (exceeding federal 60-day floor), caregivers of children under 13, participants in substance use disorder treatment, individuals with chronic conditions affecting work capacity, residents of counties with unemployment rates exceeding 150% of state average, and participants in disability determination processes.

*Good Cause Extensions:* Members who miss requirements can demonstrate good cause for extended periods before facing consequences. Documentation barriers, health emergencies, and family circumstances qualify for good cause.

*Suspension Before Termination:* Following Arkansas's failure, Kentucky proposes benefit suspension rather than termination for initial non-compliance. Members remain enrolled and can have benefits restored without full reapplication.

*Reporting Flexibility:* Quarterly rather than monthly reporting reduces administrative burden. Members report hours for the prior quarter rather than monthly.

**Administrative Preparation**

Despite gubernatorial opposition to the underlying policy, the Cabinet for Health and Family Services is proceeding with implementation planning:

- System modifications building on existing Kynect infrastructure
- County partnerships for verification support
- MCO contract modifications for care coordination
- Appeals process development
- Outreach planning for member education

The Beshear administration's approach appears to be implementing the federal mandate while using every available mechanism to minimize coverage loss.

## Defining Characteristics

**Appalachian Geography as Implementation Barrier**

Kentucky's defining characteristic is geography that makes work requirements structurally impossible to enforce in significant portions of the state without causing mass coverage loss. Eastern Kentucky is not merely rural; it is economically devastated in ways that make employment-based requirements disconnected from reality.

Consider the circumstances facing a Medicaid member in Owsley County:

- County population: approximately 4,000 (declined 15% since 2010)
- County unemployment rate: approximately 12% (official), effective rate higher as many have left workforce
- Major employers: school district, county government
- Nearest hospital: 40+ miles
- Public transportation: nonexistent
- Broadband access: limited and unreliable
- Largest private employers: Dollar General, convenience stores

A work requirement asking this person to document 80 hours monthly of employment in a county with effectively no private sector employment is not a behavioral incentive. It is an administrative mechanism for coverage loss.

Multiply this across 54 Appalachian counties, and the scope of the implementation problem becomes clear. Kentucky cannot enforce work requirements in eastern Kentucky without coverage losses that would devastate communities already facing health crises.

**The Opioid Epidemic Overlay**

Kentucky's opioid and polysubstance epidemic compounds implementation challenges. The state has among the highest overdose death rates nationally, with eastern Kentucky counties among the worst affected.

Substance use disorder creates multiple interactions with work requirements:

*Treatment as Qualifying Activity:* SUD treatment participation counts as qualifying activity. But treatment availability is limited. Many eastern Kentucky counties have no medication-assisted treatment providers. Waiting lists for residential treatment extend months. Requiring people to participate in treatment that doesn't exist fails as policy design.

*Active Use and Compliance Capacity:* People with active substance use disorders may struggle to maintain documentation requirements regardless of underlying work status. The administrative capacity that compliance requires may exceed what people in active addiction can manage.

*Recovery and Employment Timing:* Early recovery is fragile. Requiring immediate work documentation from people newly in recovery may undermine recovery success. The SUD treatment exemption helps, but exemption documentation itself requires administrative capacity.

**Disability Prevalence**

Kentucky has among the highest disability rates nationally. Approximately 19% of working-age Kentuckians report disability, compared to approximately 10% nationally. In some eastern Kentucky counties, disability rates exceed 30%.

This disability burden reflects multiple factors: coal mining occupational disease (black lung, respiratory conditions, injuries), opioid epidemic effects, multi-generational poverty limiting healthcare access, and economic conditions where disability income represents more stable income than available employment.

Many Kentuckians with disabilities are not receiving SSI or SSDI but have conditions that functionally limit work capacity. The medical frailty exemption pathway requires documentation that people without consistent healthcare access struggle to obtain.

**Coal Country Transition**

Eastern Kentucky's economy was built on coal. That economy has collapsed. Coal employment fell from approximately 18,000 jobs in 2008 to under 4,000 in 2024. The communities built around coal mining have not transitioned to alternative economies.

The coal transition creates specific work requirement challenges:

*Occupational Disease:* Former miners often have respiratory conditions, injuries, and black lung that limit employment capacity but may not qualify for disability determinations. Black lung disease, thought to be declining, is resurging among younger miners exposed to silica dust in thin-seam mining.

*Skills Mismatch:* Coal mining skills do not transfer to available employment. Retraining programs exist but cannot overcome the fundamental absence of employers in former coal communities.

*Age Concentration:* The remaining coal workforce skews older. Workers in their 50s and 60s with decades of mining experience face both health limitations and age discrimination in job seeking.

**Kynect Infrastructure Advantage**

Kentucky's one implementation advantage is Kynect. The enrollment infrastructure that achieved historic coverage gains in 2014-2016 remains operational. Unlike states building from scratch, Kentucky has:

- Established navigator networks and community partnerships
- Functional eligibility systems with member contact information
- MCO relationships with experience serving the expansion population
- Historical data on population characteristics and needs

Whether enrollment infrastructure translates to verification infrastructure is untested, but Kentucky starts with capacity other states lack.

## Expected Policy Posture and Timeline

**Anticipated Approach: Reluctant Compliance with Maximum Mitigation**

Kentucky's expected implementation philosophy is reluctant compliance with federal mandates while using every available mechanism to minimize coverage loss. The Democratic governor opposes work requirements but cannot prevent federal implementation. The approach will likely include:

*Geographic Exemptions:* Counties with unemployment rates substantially above state average may receive effective exemptions. Eastern Kentucky enforcement may be minimal while Louisville and Lexington face standard verification.

*Generous Good Cause:* Documentation barriers, health issues, and family circumstances will likely receive broad good cause treatment, reducing consequences for non-compliance.

*SUD Treatment Emphasis:* Substance use disorder treatment participation will be actively promoted as qualifying activity, with treatment referrals integrated into verification outreach.

*Suspension Rather Than Termination:* Following Arkansas's cautionary experience, Kentucky will likely suspend benefits rather than terminate coverage for initial non-compliance, allowing restoration without full reapplication.

**Timeline**

- March 2025: Waiver amendment submitted
- Spring-Summer 2025: CMS review and negotiation
- Fall 2025: Anticipated approval; system development intensifies
- Winter 2025-2026: MCO contract modifications; worker training; member outreach
- Mid-2026: Pilot implementation likely in urban areas
- December 2026: Full implementation aligned with federal deadline

**Key Uncertainties**

*Federal Oversight:* Will CMS allow the geographic exemptions and generous good cause provisions Kentucky's application includes? A strict federal posture could force more aggressive enforcement than the state prefers.

*Eastern Kentucky Treatment:* How Kentucky handles the 54 Appalachian counties will determine whether work requirements cause regional health crisis. Mass coverage loss in communities already facing opioid epidemic and healthcare access challenges would compound existing devastation.

*Political Transition:* Beshear cannot run for reelection in 2027. A Republican successor could pursue more aggressive enforcement than current implementation planning anticipates.

*MCO Role:* Whether MCOs operating in Kentucky see their role as supporting compliance or protecting enrollment will affect how aggressively they pursue verification versus accommodation.

## Summary: What Kentucky Is Expected to Do

Kentucky will implement work requirements under federal mandate despite gubernatorial opposition. The state's approach will likely minimize enforcement through broad exemptions, generous good cause provisions, and geographic accommodations for Appalachian counties where employment is structurally unavailable.

The fundamental implementation question is whether policy can be designed that acknowledges reality. Eastern Kentucky lacks jobs. Requiring documentation of work in communities without employment opportunities is not a behavioral incentive; it is an administrative pathway to coverage loss. Kentucky's challenge is implementing federal requirements without causing health catastrophe in regions already devastated by coal economy collapse, opioid epidemic, and population decline.

Kynect infrastructure provides implementation capacity other states lack, but enrollment capacity and verification capacity are different capabilities. Whether the navigator networks and community partnerships that achieved historic coverage gains can support compliance documentation remains untested.

Kentucky's outcomes will be watched as the test case for whether work requirements can be implemented in regions of concentrated poverty and job scarcity. If mass coverage losses occur in Appalachian Kentucky, the human consequences will be severe and visible. If broad exemptions effectively exclude eastern Kentucky from enforcement, work requirements become policy for Louisville and Lexington only.

## Cross-Program Context

**SNAP ABAWD Coordination**

Kentucky operates SNAP work requirements for overlapping populations. The state's waiver includes deemed compliance provisions: members meeting SNAP requirements are automatically compliant for Medicaid. This reduces duplicative burden but also means noncompliance with SNAP work requirements could trigger Medicaid consequences.

**TANF Work Requirements**

Kentucky Transitional Assistance Program (K-TAP) includes work requirements for TANF recipients. Infrastructure from TANF administration supports Medicaid implementation, though TANF serves a different population.

**Black Lung and Disability Programs**

Many eastern Kentuckians receive federal black lung benefits or are in disability determination processes. Coordination between Medicaid work requirements and federal disability programs requires careful design to avoid terminating coverage for people awaiting disability determinations.

**Provider Tax Dependence**

Kentucky relies significantly on hospital provider taxes for Medicaid financing. Rural hospitals in eastern Kentucky operate on thin margins with high uncompensated care. Coverage losses that increase uninsurance in communities these hospitals serve could destabilize facilities already struggling.

**Marketplace Transitions**

Kentucky operates Kynect as a state-based marketplace. Members losing Medicaid may transition to marketplace coverage with subsidies depending on income. The integrated Kynect system provides smoother transitions than states using the federal marketplace, potentially reducing coverage gaps.
