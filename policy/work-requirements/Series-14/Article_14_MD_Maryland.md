## Work Requirement History

Maryland has no prior experience with Medicaid work requirements. The state never submitted a Section 1115 waiver application seeking work requirement authority during the 2018-2020 period when other states pursued such waivers. Democratic governors Martin O'Malley, Larry Hogan (R), and now Wes Moore all maintained the HealthChoice program without work-related conditions.

Governor Larry Hogan, despite being a Republican, did not pursue Medicaid work requirements during his two terms (2015-2023). Hogan prioritized maintaining the state's unique healthcare payment model and did not engage with the Trump administration's 2018 invitation for states to implement community engagement requirements. Maryland's bipartisan consensus around the HealthChoice program and the Total Cost of Care model created a different political context than states where work requirements became partisan flashpoints.

The absence of prior implementation experience means Maryland approaches the December 2026 federal mandate without institutional learning about verification systems, exemption processes, or the administrative challenges that Georgia, Arkansas, and Michigan encountered. The state must build these capabilities from scratch while managing multiple simultaneous healthcare system transitions.

## Current Policy and Waiver Status

**Political Landscape**

Governor Wes Moore (D) took office in January 2023, becoming Maryland's first Black governor. The Moore administration has expressed concern about the impact of federal work requirements but has not announced specific implementation strategies. Democrats control both chambers of the General Assembly with supermajorities.

The administration's healthcare priorities have focused on protecting programs from federal cuts rather than proactively designing work requirement systems. In November 2025, after state analysts projected a $1.5 billion deficit in fiscal year 2027 due to federal changes including increased Medicaid costs from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Governor Moore ruled out tax increases during the 2026 legislative session.

Maryland Secretary of Health Meena Seshamani brings unique federal perspective to state implementation. Seshamani served as deputy administrator at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services from 2021 to 2025 before joining the Moore administration. Her federal experience may inform Maryland's approach to work requirement implementation, though her tenure at CMS was during the Biden administration's period of opposition to work requirements.

**Healthcare System Transition**

Maryland faces a simultaneous challenge that no other state confronts: implementing Medicaid work requirements while transitioning its entire hospital payment system. The state's Total Cost of Care Model, which gave Maryland unique authority to set hospital payment rates for all payers including Medicare and Medicaid, ended in December 2025. Maryland is transitioning to the federal AHEAD model (Achieving Healthcare Efficiency through Accountable Design), though terms remain under negotiation with the Trump administration.

This dual transition creates administrative complexity. The Health Services Cost Review Commission (HSCRC), which has regulated hospital rates since the 1970s, must adapt to new federal oversight while state Medicaid agencies simultaneously build work requirement verification infrastructure. Staff attention and technology investments must serve two major transformations at once.

If Maryland loses authority to set hospital rates under AHEAD revisions, the ripple effects could destabilize the all-payer system that has kept healthcare costs consistent across Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial insurance. Hospital systems already expressing concern about rural sustainability may face additional pressure if work requirements reduce Medicaid enrollment and increase uncompensated care.

**Waiver Considerations**

Maryland has not announced plans to submit a Section 1115 waiver application modifying federal work requirement parameters. The state could seek waivers for extended exemption categories, alternative verification approaches, or delayed implementation timelines. Whether the Moore administration pursues state-specific modifications or accepts federal defaults remains unclear.

## Defining Characteristics

**The Federal Workforce Factor**

Maryland's concentration of federal workers creates a population dynamic unlike any other state. The 269,000 federal employees represent approximately 10% of the state workforce. When combined with over 200,000 federal contractors, the federal-dependent workforce approaches 20% of Maryland employment.

This concentration creates two distinct work requirement implications. First, federal job losses during 2025 have pushed some workers onto Medicaid who previously had employer coverage. People transitioning from federal employment to job searches may meet work requirements during initial months but face verification challenges documenting activities that don't fit standard employment templates.

Second, the economic ripple effects of federal workforce contraction affect businesses throughout Maryland, particularly in suburban Washington areas. If federal spending reductions continue, private sector employers serving federal markets may reduce workforces, pushing additional workers toward Medicaid eligibility. Work requirements arriving during economic contraction create a more challenging environment than during labor market tightness.

**The All-Payer System's Relevance**

Maryland's all-payer hospital system, where all insurers pay the same rates for the same services, creates unusual dynamics for work requirement implementation. In other states, hospitals face different financial incentives for Medicaid versus commercially insured patients. In Maryland, the financial impact of Medicaid disenrollment on hospital revenues is more direct because rate-setting accounts for total patient volume.

The HSCRC has historically adjusted hospital global budgets based on population health factors. If work requirements cause significant Medicaid disenrollment, hospitals may seek global budget adjustments to account for increased uncompensated care from newly uninsured populations. This creates state-level fiscal pressure that other states, where hospital rates are market-determined, don't experience in the same way.

Rural hospitals on the Eastern Shore and in Western Maryland already operate under financial stress. TidalHealth, the largest tertiary referral hospital on the Eastern Shore, has publicly expressed concern about the inequity of cost containment requirements for rural facilities. Work requirement-driven coverage losses could accelerate rural hospital vulnerability.

**Urban Concentration and Rural Isolation**

Maryland's geography creates two distinct implementation contexts. The Baltimore-Washington corridor contains the majority of the expansion population, with robust healthcare infrastructure, public transportation, and multiple MCO options. Work requirement verification in urban areas can leverage dense service networks and electronic verification systems.

The Eastern Shore presents opposite challenges. Eight rural counties have 76% of residents living in federally designated medically underserved areas. Caroline, Kent, Somerset, and Worcester counties each have 100% of their population in medically underserved areas. The five Maryland counties with the fewest primary care physicians per capita are all on the Eastern Shore, with Caroline County having only one provider per 2,500 residents compared to Baltimore County's one per 1,000.

Agricultural work dominates Eastern Shore employment, creating seasonal patterns that may complicate monthly work hour verification. Immigrant farmworker populations face language access barriers and documentation challenges. The handful of health and social service workers serving the region, described by researchers as "stretched dangerously thin," will struggle to absorb work requirement navigation responsibilities.

Western Maryland's Allegany and Garrett counties share Appalachian characteristics with neighboring West Virginia and Pennsylvania, including higher poverty rates, older populations, and limited employment options. These counties had the highest unemployment rates in Maryland before federal changes.

**Managed Care Infrastructure**

Maryland operates HealthChoice, the state's mandatory Medicaid managed care program since 1997. Nine managed care organizations serve the expansion population: Aetna Better Health, Amerigroup Community Care, JAI Medical Systems, Kaiser Permanente, Maryland Physicians Care, MedStar Family Choice, Priority Partners, United Healthcare, and University of Maryland Health Partners.

Four MCOs offer statewide network coverage, while others concentrate in specific regions. This infrastructure provides implementation capacity for work requirement verification and member communication, though MCOs will need to develop new workflows for monitoring compliance status and supporting members at risk of termination.

The Maryland Managed Care Organization Association (MMCOA), formed in 2017, provides a coordination mechanism for industry response to work requirements. MCOs have financial interest in maintaining enrollment, particularly for complex members generating risk-adjusted payments.

## Summary: What Maryland Is Expected to Do

Maryland will implement federal work requirements by December 2026 with minimal state-specific modifications unless the Moore administration pursues waiver authority for alternative approaches. The state's Democratic leadership has expressed concern about coverage losses but has not announced proactive implementation strategies that would minimize harm while meeting federal requirements.

The dual challenge of work requirement implementation and AHEAD model transition will strain administrative capacity. Healthcare system leaders, already managing uncertainty about hospital rate-setting authority, must simultaneously prepare for enrollment volatility from work requirements.

Geographic disparities will require targeted approaches. Urban Baltimore and suburban Washington populations have access to verification infrastructure that rural Eastern Shore and Western Maryland populations lack. Statewide policy must accommodate both contexts.

The federal workforce disruption creates economic uncertainty that compounds work requirement challenges. Maryland's expansion population includes people newly eligible due to federal job losses, people facing job insecurity from ongoing federal workforce actions, and people affected by economic ripple effects throughout the federal contracting sector.

MCO infrastructure provides implementation capacity, but the nine-plan market creates coordination challenges. Whether MCOs develop consistent approaches to member support or compete on retention strategies remains to be determined.

**Key Uncertainties**

The Moore administration's implementation approach remains undefined. Will Maryland seek waivers for extended exemptions, alternative verification approaches, or delayed timelines? Will the state invest in navigation infrastructure to minimize procedural disenrollment? Will the administration publicly oppose work requirements while complying, or quietly implement federal defaults?

The AHEAD model negotiation outcome affects Medicaid implementation context. If Maryland loses rate-setting authority, hospital systems may deprioritize Medicaid populations while facing broader revenue uncertainty. If Maryland maintains modified rate-setting under AHEAD, the all-payer system continues to create unique incentives for maintaining coverage.

Federal workforce trajectory affects the expansion population composition. Continued federal job losses push more previously employed people onto Medicaid, potentially changing the work requirement compliance profile. People accustomed to stable employment may navigate verification requirements differently than populations with longer Medicaid tenure.

## Cross-Program Context

**SNAP Employment & Training**

Maryland operates SNAP E&T programs but has not established automatic deemed compliance between SNAP and Medicaid work requirements. Cross-program coordination could reduce verification burden for enrollees meeting requirements through SNAP.

**Provider Tax Structure**

Maryland utilizes provider taxes on MCOs, hospitals, and nursing facilities for Medicaid financing. The state returns increased Medicaid payment rates to taxed providers. This creates provider interest in maintaining Medicaid enrollment and may generate hospital advocacy for implementation approaches that minimize coverage loss.

**Marketplace Infrastructure**

Maryland operates a state-based health insurance marketplace, Maryland Health Connection, providing robust infrastructure for coverage transitions. The state has implemented Maryland Premium Assistance to help offset federal enhanced premium tax credit expiration. Expansion adults losing Medicaid may have marketplace options, though affordability depends on income and subsidy availability.

**ACA Subsidy Expiration Effects**

The expiration of enhanced ACA premium tax credits particularly affects Maryland, where 190,000 residents received enhanced subsidies in 2025. Premium increases averaging 95% for this population will affect marketplace affordability for people transitioning from Medicaid due to work requirement noncompliance. Maryland's state premium assistance program partially mitigates but does not fully offset federal subsidy reduction.
