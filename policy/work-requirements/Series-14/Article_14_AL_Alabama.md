## Work Requirement History

Alabama has not implemented work requirements because the state has not expanded Medicaid. However, the state's 2018 waiver proposal reveals significant policy preferences that would likely shape any future expansion approach.

**The 2018 Waiver Proposal**

In early 2018, the Alabama Medicaid Agency published a Section 1115 waiver proposal that would have imposed work requirements on the state's existing Medicaid population. The proposal was notable for its aggressive requirements, significantly exceeding what other states had proposed.

The waiver would have required 35 hours weekly of qualifying activities for parents with children aged six or older, and 20 hours weekly for parents with children under six. This 35-hour threshold was the most stringent proposed by any state and approached full-time employment requirements. Most states proposing work requirements settled on 20 hours weekly (80 hours monthly).

The proposal targeted the Parent and Other Caretaker Relative eligibility category, the only pathway through which non-disabled adults can qualify for Alabama Medicaid. This population already faces extraordinarily restrictive income limits: a single parent with two children must earn below 18% of the federal poverty level (approximately $4,800 annually) to qualify. A parent earning $500 monthly would exceed eligibility thresholds.

**The Catch-22 Problem**

Public comments during the state's comment period identified a fundamental contradiction: the waiver would have created a system where compliance caused termination. A parent meeting the 35-hour weekly work requirement at minimum wage would earn approximately $1,260 monthly, far exceeding the income threshold for Medicaid eligibility. Commenters described this as a "catch-22" where people who complied would lose coverage because they earned too much, while those who could not comply would lose coverage for noncompliance.

In response to comments, Alabama modified the proposal to include up to 18 months of transitional Medicaid coverage for parents whose income increased above eligibility thresholds. The modified proposal was submitted to CMS in September 2018.

**Federal Processing and Pandemic Suspension**

The waiver remained pending with CMS when the COVID-19 pandemic began in early 2020. The federal continuous enrollment requirement suspended all Medicaid disenrollments, effectively halting waiver processing. Alabama never received CMS approval or denial, and the proposal remains in administrative limbo.

The state has not formally withdrawn the application, nor has it submitted updated proposals. The 2018 waiver reflects policy preferences under Governor Kay Ivey's administration that would likely inform any future expansion approach.

## Current Policy and Waiver Status

**Non-Expansion Status**

Alabama remains one of ten states that have not expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. The state's decision affects an estimated 200,000-340,000 residents who would gain eligibility under expansion, including approximately 92,000-128,000 currently in the coverage gap with no realistic pathway to affordable coverage.

Alabama's current Medicaid program covers only specific populations: children (up to 146% FPL), pregnant women (up to 146% FPL during pregnancy), elderly individuals requiring institutional care, disabled individuals receiving SSI, and parents with extremely low income (18% FPL). Healthy adults without dependent children cannot qualify regardless of income.

**Federal Work Requirements and Non-Expansion States**

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act's work requirements apply to Medicaid expansion adults, not to traditional Medicaid populations. Because Alabama has not expanded Medicaid, the federal work requirements do not directly affect the state's current program. Alabama has no expansion population to which December 2026 requirements would apply.

However, the OB3 creates new dynamics for non-expansion states. The law eliminated the enhanced 90% federal matching rate for expansion populations, instead offering a time-limited 80% match for states that expand within two years of enactment. For Alabama, this changes the expansion calculation: the previous guaranteed 90% federal match is no longer available, though an 80% match for initial expansion may still be attractive compared to the state's regular 72.84% FMAP.

**Rural Health Transformation Program Engagement**

In September 2025, Governor Ivey announced Alabama's participation in the OB3's Rural Health Transformation Program, a $50 billion federal initiative to strengthen rural healthcare delivery. The state submitted its application in November 2025, ahead of the federal deadline.

This engagement signals the administration's interest in federal healthcare funding while maintaining opposition to traditional Medicaid expansion. Governor Ivey characterized the Rural Health Transformation Program as an opportunity to "make meaningful improvements in how we deliver health care in rural Alabama" without the policy commitments expansion would require.

**Medicaid Leadership Transition**

In July 2025, Governor Ivey appointed Bo Offord as Alabama Medicaid Commissioner, replacing Stephanie Azar who had led the agency for over 13 years. Offord, a longtime agency administrator, assumed the position in a period of federal policy uncertainty. Whether this leadership transition signals continuity or potential policy evolution remains unclear.

## Defining Characteristics

**The Strictest Eligibility in America**

Alabama and Texas maintain the most restrictive Medicaid eligibility requirements nationally. The 18% FPL income threshold for parents means a family of three must earn below approximately $4,800 annually to qualify. A parent working half-time at minimum wage exceeds this threshold. The extreme restriction creates a coverage gap where working people cannot qualify for Medicaid regardless of income if they lack qualifying children, and parents who work even modest hours lose eligibility.

This context shapes any work requirement discussion. Alabama's traditional Medicaid population is already profoundly work-limited; those who could work more have long since exceeded income eligibility. Work requirements on this population would primarily affect people with significant barriers to employment, many of whom qualify for exemptions in other states' proposals.

**Rural Healthcare Crisis**

Alabama faces one of the nation's most severe rural hospital crises. Since 2010, at least 14 rural hospitals have closed, with 7 located in or serving Black Belt communities. According to recent analyses, 19-27 additional hospitals are at immediate risk of closure, with 83% of rural hospitals operating at negative margins.

The hospital crisis concentrates in regions that would benefit most from Medicaid expansion. Counties without hospitals cannot provide emergency services for compliance with work verification or exemption documentation. Healthcare deserts create practical impossibility for some populations to engage with any compliance system, regardless of how it is designed.

Fifty-two rural hospitals remain operational, serving approximately 2 million Alabamians annually. The Alabama Hospital Association has advocated for Medicaid expansion as essential to rural hospital survival, though the organization has stopped short of opposing work requirements as a condition of expansion.

**Black Belt Health Disparities**

The Black Belt region presents concentrated healthcare challenges that distinguish Alabama from other southern states. Twenty-one of 24 Black Belt counties have among the highest Medicaid enrollment percentages in the state (approximately 28% compared to 23% statewide), yet face the most severe provider shortages.

Twelve counties with the highest diabetes rates in Alabama are located in the Black Belt. Infant mortality, heart disease, and other health indicators consistently rank among the nation's worst. Provider recruitment is nearly impossible: Medicaid reimbursement rates are the lowest in the nation, meaning physicians can earn substantially more for identical work in neighboring states.

Any work requirement implementation in an expanded Alabama Medicaid program would face these geographic realities. Black Belt residents cannot access employment verification services, exemption documentation, or compliance support in regions where even basic healthcare is unavailable.

**Limited Managed Care Infrastructure**

Unlike most states, Alabama operates Medicaid primarily through fee-for-service rather than risk-based managed care. The Alabama Coordinated Health Network (ACHN) program, launched in 2022 with contracts totaling $89 million, provides care coordination through seven regional contractors. However, medical services remain fee-for-service.

Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alabama's My Care Alabama affiliate operates ACHN contracts in three of seven regions. The state's 2013 Regional Care Organization initiative, which would have created risk-based managed care, was abandoned in 2017 after years of development and millions in spending.

The limited managed care infrastructure means Alabama lacks the MCO capacity that other states would rely on for work requirement implementation. If Alabama expanded Medicaid with work requirements, the state would need to either build substantial new administrative infrastructure or dramatically expand ACHN capabilities.

## Expected Policy Posture and Timeline

**Continued Non-Expansion With Conditions**

Governor Ivey has maintained consistent skepticism toward Medicaid expansion while leaving the door slightly open. Her office has repeatedly stated concern about "how the state would pay for it long-term." The administration has shown interest in private-public partnership models similar to Arkansas's approach, which uses Medicaid funds to purchase private marketplace coverage.

House Speaker Nathaniel Ledbetter floated the private-public model in early 2024, and lawmakers received briefings from Arkansas and North Carolina officials. Some Republican legislators have expressed willingness to continue discussions, though no legislation has advanced.

The combination of conservative political control, fiscal concerns, and ongoing rural healthcare crisis suggests Alabama might eventually consider expansion through a private-public model with work requirements. Such an approach would align with the 2018 waiver proposal's philosophy while potentially addressing concerns about traditional Medicaid expansion.

**Federal Dynamics**

OB3's changes to expansion financing create new decision points. The elimination of the permanent 90% match reduces the financial attractiveness of expansion, while the Rural Health Transformation Program provides alternative federal funding pathways. Alabama may pursue rural health funding while continuing to resist expansion, effectively addressing some healthcare access concerns without expanding Medicaid eligibility.

The provider tax restrictions in OB3 create additional fiscal pressure. Alabama utilizes provider taxes for Medicaid financing; caps on these mechanisms would shift costs to the state general fund or require benefit reductions. These pressures could eventually force reconsideration of expansion's fiscal benefits.

**If Expansion Occurred**

Should Alabama eventually expand Medicaid, federal work requirements would immediately apply to the expansion population. Based on the 2018 waiver proposal, Alabama would likely implement requirements at or above federal minimums, potentially seeking waivers for stricter thresholds.

The state would face implementation challenges more severe than expansion states with existing infrastructure. Alabama would need to build verification systems, establish exemption processes, train staff, and develop community partnerships essentially from scratch while simultaneously enrolling 200,000+ newly eligible adults.

The Black Belt's healthcare deserts would require either substantial exemptions for geographic barriers or acceptance that significant populations cannot realistically comply. Alabama's experience would test whether work requirements can function in regions with minimal healthcare and employment infrastructure.

## Summary: What Alabama Is Expected to Do

Alabama will most likely remain a non-expansion state through December 2026, meaning federal work requirements will not directly affect its Medicaid program. The state's engagement with the Rural Health Transformation Program signals interest in addressing healthcare access without expanding eligibility.

If Alabama eventually expands Medicaid, the state's 2018 waiver proposal suggests implementation would be aggressive: high hour requirements, limited exemptions, and strict enforcement. The catch-22 dynamics identified in 2018 would need resolution, likely through transitional coverage provisions.

The state's limited managed care infrastructure, rural hospital crisis, and Black Belt healthcare deserts create implementation challenges unmatched in most other states. Alabama cannot rely on MCOs for enrollment management or care coordination the way expansion states will. The state would need to build substantial new capacity or accept that implementation will be decentralized and uneven.

Alabama's trajectory will likely be determined by rural hospital viability. If closures accelerate and healthcare access deteriorates further, pressure for some form of coverage expansion may become politically sustainable. Work requirements would almost certainly accompany any Alabama expansion, framed as personal responsibility provisions that make expansion politically acceptable.

For states that have expanded Medicaid, Alabama serves as a reference point for what non-expansion looks like: coverage gaps, healthcare deserts, hospital closures, and populations without access to affordable coverage. The comparison shapes the stakes of work requirement implementation elsewhere. If work requirements cause coverage losses in expansion states, those populations may find themselves in Alabama-like circumstances despite living in states that chose to expand.

## Cross-Program Context

**SNAP and TANF Work Requirements**

Alabama operates SNAP and TANF with work requirements for applicable populations. SNAP Employment & Training services are delivered through state and local partnerships. No automatic deemed compliance exists between programs. The infrastructure for work requirement verification exists but at limited scale relative to what Medicaid expansion would require.

**Provider Tax Situation**

Alabama utilizes provider taxes for Medicaid financing but at lower levels than states like New York or California. OB3's provider tax restrictions would affect the state's ability to increase these mechanisms to fund any future expansion. The fiscal constraints compound the long-term cost concerns the administration has cited.

**Marketplace Infrastructure**

Alabama operates through the federally facilitated marketplace (HealthCare.gov). Enhanced ACA subsidies have provided coverage options for people above poverty, but coverage gap residents below 100% FPL have no subsidy access. If enhanced subsidies expire, the uninsured population would grow substantially, potentially creating additional pressure for Medicaid expansion.

**Rural Hospital Investment Tax Credit**

The state legislature is considering the Rural Hospital Investment Tax Credit, modeled after Georgia's program, which would provide tax incentives for donations to rural hospitals. This represents an alternative approach to supporting rural healthcare without Medicaid expansion. Georgia's program has generated over $430 million since 2017.
