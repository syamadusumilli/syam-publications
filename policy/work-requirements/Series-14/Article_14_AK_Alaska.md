## Work Requirement History

Alaska has no prior Medicaid work requirement experience. The state expanded Medicaid in September 2015 under Governor Bill Walker, an independent who had won election with Democratic support. Walker bypassed the legislature, which had rejected expansion proposals, by implementing expansion through executive action following a mandatory waiting period for legislative review.

The expansion proved consequential. In the three years following implementation, nearly $1 billion in federal funding flowed to Alaska's healthcare system. Hospital uncompensated care declined by nearly half. By mid-2025, total Medicaid expansion claims exceeded $5.97 billion.

Governor Walker did not seek reelection in 2018. Republican Mike Dunleavy won the governorship and initially proposed significant Medicaid cuts, including elimination of some optional benefits. Budget conflicts with the legislature consumed much of his first term. The Dunleavy administration has not pursued Medicaid work requirements through Section 1115 waiver authority, though Dunleavy supported reinstating SNAP work requirements in 2019 and generally favors work requirements philosophically.

**Current Posture**

The Dunleavy administration has taken a measured approach to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act provisions. The Alaska Department of Health has created dedicated informational resources explaining OB3 impacts, emphasizing that Alaska's circumstances differ significantly from most states due to the exemption for American Indians and Alaska Natives.

The state's official messaging acknowledges that many Alaskans will be exempt from new community engagement requirements, making full impact assessment complicated. The Department of Health has indicated it is evaluating implementation approaches and working closely with federal partners.

The state has positioned itself to benefit from OB3's Rural Health Transformation Program, submitting an application for funding from the $50 billion five-year program. Alaska's rural population and geographic challenges make it particularly well-positioned for this funding stream, which could offset some impacts of Medicaid spending reductions.

## Defining Characteristics

**The Alaska Native Exemption**

The single most important factor shaping Alaska's work requirement implementation is the exemption for American Indians and Alaska Natives recognized as eligible for Indian Health Service. This exemption, written into the OB3 legislation, removes a substantial portion of Alaska's expansion population from work requirement applicability.

Alaska has the largest percentage of AI/AN population of any state at approximately 22%. Among Medicaid enrollees, approximately 91,000 identify as Alaska Native or American Indian. While not all of these individuals are in the expansion population, the exemption significantly reduces the number of Alaskans who will face community engagement requirements.

The exemption reflects the federal government's trust responsibility to tribal nations and acknowledges that Indian Health Service and tribal health facilities depend on Medicaid reimbursement for significant portions of their operating budgets. Applying work requirements to AI/AN populations could destabilize the tribal health system that serves all 228 federally recognized Alaska tribes.

**The Tribal Health System**

Alaska operates the most extensive tribally managed health system in the United States. Under the Alaska Tribal Health Compact, 99% of the Alaska Area Indian Health Service budget flows to tribes and tribal organizations operating under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. The system includes tribally managed hospitals in Anchorage, Barrow, Bethel, Dillingham, Kotzebue, Nome, Sitka, and Wrangell, along with 72 tribal health centers and 148 community health aide clinics.

The Alaska Native Medical Center in Anchorage serves as the statewide referral center and specialty care gatekeeper. The Community Health Aide Program, developed in the 1950s and formalized in 1968, deploys approximately 550 Community Health Aides and Practitioners across more than 170 rural villages, providing primary care in communities too small or remote for physician coverage.

Medicaid reimbursement provides essential revenue for this system. The federal government pays 100% of the cost for Medicaid services delivered to AI/AN beneficiaries at IHS and tribal facilities, making these services cost-neutral to the state while generating federal revenue that supports broader tribal health infrastructure. Coverage losses among AI/AN populations would reduce this revenue stream, potentially affecting care availability for all tribal members regardless of Medicaid status.

**Fee-for-Service Administration**

Alaska operates its Medicaid program entirely through fee-for-service reimbursement, making it one of the few states without Medicaid managed care. The state briefly explored managed care for one geographic region in 2019 but halted those plans. This administrative structure means Alaska lacks the infrastructure of managed care organizations that might absorb some implementation burden for work requirements.

Without MCOs, the state Medicaid agency must directly handle all verification, reporting, exemption processing, and compliance monitoring. The Alaska Division of Public Assistance has experienced significant staffing challenges, with backlogs in SNAP and Medicaid applications during recent years. Building additional administrative capacity for work requirement compliance will compete with these existing challenges.

**Geographic Isolation**

Alaska's geography creates implementation challenges unlike any other state. More than 200 communities are accessible only by air or water. In winter, some communities can be reached by ice roads, but many remain isolated year-round except by aircraft. A resident of Bethel requiring specialty medical care must fly to Anchorage. A resident of a smaller village might need multiple flights.

This isolation affects employment verification in fundamental ways. Many rural Alaskans participate in subsistence economies where hunting, fishing, and gathering provide substantial household resources but generate no documentation acceptable for work requirement verification. Seasonal employment in commercial fishing generates income during limited periods but may not meet monthly hour requirements outside fishing season.

The state has acknowledged these challenges, noting that the OB3's high unemployment hardship exemption provisions could benefit 15 boroughs and census areas where unemployment exceeds the threshold of either 8% or 1.5 times the national unemployment rate. Areas like the Kusilvak Census Area, with unemployment consistently above 15%, would qualify for exemption from work requirements entirely.

## Expected Approach

**Maximizing Exemptions**

Alaska's implementation will likely emphasize maximizing available exemptions to minimize coverage disruption. The state's official communications already emphasize the breadth of exemption categories: AI/AN individuals, pregnant women, medically frail adults, caregivers, and individuals in high-unemployment areas.

The practical effect in Alaska is that work requirements may apply to a relatively small population. Representative Nick Begich has claimed that only 7% of the Medicaid expansion population will need to meet requirements after all exemptions are applied. While this figure has not been independently verified, the combination of AI/AN exemptions and high-unemployment area exemptions could substantially reduce the affected population.

**Administrative Challenges**

Despite the reduced scope, Alaska faces distinctive administrative challenges. The state must build verification systems for those who do remain subject to requirements, even if that population is smaller than in other states. The fee-for-service structure provides no MCO infrastructure to leverage. The Division of Public Assistance has experienced staffing constraints that will complicate adding new compliance functions.

The state's existing eligibility systems integrate with the federal HealthCare.gov platform rather than operating a state-based marketplace. This may constrain flexibility in designing verification workflows tailored to Alaska's circumstances.

**Semi-Annual Redetermination**

The OB3 requirement for semi-annual eligibility redetermination for expansion adults presents challenges in a state where mail service to rural communities can be irregular and where many residents lack consistent internet access. The state will need to develop communication strategies appropriate for remote populations, potentially leveraging tribal health organizations and Community Health Aides as touchpoints for compliance outreach.

**Rural Health Transformation Program**

The Dunleavy administration has actively pursued Rural Health Transformation Program funding, submitting an application to CMS to bring approximately $200 million over five years to Alaska. This funding cannot cover state Medicaid matching costs but can support rural health improvements in areas such as workforce development, telehealth infrastructure, and care coordination.

The state has solicited input from communities on how to use these funds, receiving responses that helped shape six initiatives in Alaska's final application. If awarded, RHTP funding could partially offset Medicaid reductions while strengthening the rural healthcare infrastructure that serves both Medicaid and non-Medicaid populations.

## Timeline

Alaska's implementation timeline aligns with federal requirements while retaining flexibility for phased approaches:

- **December 31, 2026**: Federal work requirement effective date
- **2025-2026**: State planning and system development
- **Ongoing**: Potential good-faith waiver application for phased implementation through 2028

The state has indicated it may seek additional time to implement requirements, noting that states can apply to phase in implementation through 2028 under a good-faith waiver if they demonstrate progress toward compliance.

## Cross-Program Context

**SNAP Work Requirements**

Alaska already administers SNAP ABAWD work requirements with established exemption processes for high-unemployment areas. As a non-contiguous state, Alaska qualifies for broader ABAWD waivers when state unemployment reaches 1.5 times the national rate. The OB3 legislation extends SNAP ABAWD requirements to adults up to age 64 (previously 54) and reduces the parental exemption to children under 14 (previously under 18).

Cross-program alignment between SNAP and Medicaid work requirements could reduce administrative burden for both the state and enrollees, though no formal deemed compliance structure exists.

**Tribal Program Coordination**

The tribal health system operates parallel to but intertwined with state Medicaid. While AI/AN individuals are exempt from work requirements, they must still maintain Medicaid enrollment and comply with redetermination procedures. Tribal health organizations will likely play important roles in supporting enrollment maintenance, even if not in work requirement verification.

Community Health Aides in rural villages may serve as de facto navigators for maintaining coverage, though their primary mission remains healthcare delivery rather than benefits administration.

**Provider Tax Structure**

Alaska has minimal reliance on provider taxes for Medicaid financing compared to states like California or New York. This reduces pressure from hospital systems on coverage policy but also means less organized provider advocacy for coverage-protective implementation choices.

## Summary

Alaska occupies a unique position among states implementing Medicaid work requirements. The combination of AI/AN population exemptions, high-unemployment area exemptions, and extreme geographic isolation may limit the practical impact of work requirements to a relatively small population of non-Native urban and suburban residents.

This does not mean implementation will be simple. The state must still build administrative systems for those who do face requirements, navigate federal compliance expectations, and manage the transition for whatever population remains subject to community engagement verification. The fee-for-service program structure means the state cannot delegate implementation complexity to managed care organizations.

The tribal health system will continue operating largely unchanged, with AI/AN individuals exempt from work requirements but still enrolled in Medicaid that provides critical revenue to tribal facilities. The state's pursuit of Rural Health Transformation Program funding suggests an approach that seeks to offset Medicaid reductions through alternative federal investments in rural healthcare infrastructure.

For other states, Alaska offers limited transferable lessons given its exceptional circumstances. The state's implementation will demonstrate how work requirements function when exemptions cover the majority of the affected population, but this scenario does not generalize to states with smaller AI/AN populations and fewer high-unemployment areas. Alaska remains an outlier, as it is in so many policy domains, where scale, geography, and demographics combine to create implementation conditions found nowhere else.
