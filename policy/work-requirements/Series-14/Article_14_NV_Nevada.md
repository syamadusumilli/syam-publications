## Work Requirement History

Nevada has no prior experience implementing Medicaid work requirements. The state has been an early Medicaid expansion adopter, implementing expansion in January 2014 under then-Governor Brian Sandoval, who became the first Republican governor to commit to expansion. Sandoval cited the substantial federal funding share as the primary motivator, noting that even though he generally opposed the Affordable Care Act, expansion was the correct path for Nevada.

The state's uninsured rate dropped dramatically following expansion, from 22% in 2012 to 12% by 2015, and has continued declining to approximately 8% by 2025, the lowest recorded in state history. Nevada also achieved the largest percentage point decline in its rate of uninsured children during this period.

Unlike Georgia, Arkansas, or other states that pursued Section 1115 waivers with work requirements during the first Trump administration, Nevada made no such attempts. The state's focus has been on enrollment stabilization and provider network adequacy rather than conditional eligibility experiments.

## Current Policy and Waiver Status

**Federal Requirements Under OB3**

Nevada must implement community engagement requirements for able-bodied expansion adults by January 1, 2027. The state may apply for a waiver delaying implementation for up to two years if demonstrating good faith implementation efforts, though CMS has not yet issued guidance on waiver criteria.

State Medicaid Director Stacie Weeks has indicated that implementation details will depend on forthcoming CMS guidance. The state anticipates enrollment declines and has acknowledged that "the expansion population typically struggles to submit paperwork on time and maintain or find employment because of unstable housing, mental illness or substance use." This candid assessment suggests awareness of compliance challenges ahead.

**Nevada Health Authority Creation**

In July 2025, Governor Joe Lombardo launched the Nevada Health Authority, consolidating Medicaid, the state health insurance exchange (Silver State Health Insurance Exchange), the Children's Health Insurance Program, and public employee benefits under one agency. Stacie Weeks heads the new authority.

The consolidation is designed to improve coordination across programs and leverage state purchasing power. Whether this reorganization assists or complicates work requirement implementation remains uncertain. The integration could facilitate coordinated exemption processing across programs, or it could create disruption during the critical 2026 preparation period.

**Political Environment**

Governor Lombardo, a Republican, has voiced concern about federal Medicaid cuts while supporting fiscal responsibility. In February 2025, he wrote to congressional leaders opposing cuts that would "disrupt care for those who rely on Medicaid" and "destabilize public and private healthcare providers." However, Lombardo has not publicly opposed work requirements themselves.

The state legislature has a Democratic majority. Legislative Democrats have been vocal about protecting Medicaid expansion. This divided government may produce tension as implementation approaches, though work requirements are now federal law rather than state choice.

Nevada's Congressional delegation voted for the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, indicating federal-level Republican support for work requirements despite the state's substantial Medicaid dependence.

## Defining Characteristics

**The Tourism Economy Paradox**

Nevada presents a unique implementation challenge: the state's dominant industry creates exactly the kind of variable, seasonal, and tip-dependent employment that is hardest to verify. Hospitality workers may have fluctuating schedules, multiple part-time employers, tip income that varies dramatically, and employment patterns that shift with convention schedules, holiday seasons, and economic conditions.

The Culinary Workers Union, which covers 145,000 Nevadans through the Culinary Health Fund, already provides employer-sponsored coverage to many hospitality workers. But union coverage requires minimum hours, and workers falling below thresholds may find themselves needing Medicaid precisely when their work hours are insufficient to meet work requirements. The intersection of employment-linked private coverage and conditional public coverage creates coverage cliffs.

For the substantial gig economy workforce, verification challenges multiply. Independent contractors may have income from multiple platforms, variable week-to-week hours, and minimal documentation. Nevada's identification of gig workers comprising one-third of small business employment suggests this population is not marginal.

**Urban Concentration with Rural Isolation**

Nevada's extreme urban concentration (88% of population in two metropolitan areas) means implementation can focus resources heavily on Las Vegas and Reno. This geographic concentration is an administrative advantage compared to states with dispersed populations.

However, the 7% of Medicaid enrollees in rural areas face extreme isolation. Thirteen Critical Access Hospitals provide the only acute care across vast territories. Rural Nevada averages 5 people per square mile in many counties. Five rural hospitals have volunteer Emergency Medical Services without paramedics. Several rural hospitals operate at net losses and could be endangered by Medicaid cuts or enrollment disruptions.

Nevada Rural Hospital Partners reports that rural hospitals' payor mix is 50-60% government programs (Medicare and Medicaid). Medicaid represents 20-27% of revenue at many Critical Access Hospitals. Any significant enrollment disruption would stress already-precarious institutions.

**Highest Unemployment Nationally**

Nevada's persistently elevated unemployment rate creates tension with work requirements predicated on job availability. Throughout 2025, Nevada has recorded the highest or second-highest unemployment rate nationally, hovering at 5.3-5.5% compared to the national average of approximately 4.1%.

The unemployment concentration in Las Vegas reflects tourism-sector volatility. Strip gross gaming revenue declined for four consecutive months through mid-2025. Visitor volume dropped 6.5% year-over-year through May 2025, with 1.1 million fewer visitors than the previous year. Casinos have responded with staffing cuts.

Work requirements assume job availability. Nevada's unemployment data suggests that assumption may not hold, particularly for workers with limited skills, transportation barriers, or other constraints making them less competitive for available positions.

**Immigration and Mixed-Status Families**

Nevada has the largest share of mixed-status families in the nation. Approximately 130,000 lawful permanent residents and an estimated 210,000+ undocumented residents live in the state. Mixed-status families may include citizen children eligible for Medicaid, lawfully present adults potentially eligible for expansion coverage, and undocumented adults ineligible for Medicaid.

Work requirement implementation intersects with immigration enforcement concerns. The Trump administration's emphasis on immigration enforcement has created "chilling effects" on Medicaid enrollment among immigrant communities. Nevada Medicaid has projected enrollment declines based partly on immigrant families avoiding public benefits programs.

Governor Lombardo's 2025 expansion of 287(g) programs enabling local police-ICE collaboration in counties like Washoe may intensify concerns. When immigrant community members fear that any government interaction could trigger enforcement action, work requirement reporting becomes another barrier rather than pathway to coverage.

**Managed Care Landscape**

Nevada operates Medicaid primarily through managed care, with approximately 75% of the 738,000-800,000 Medicaid population enrolled in managed care organizations. Current MCOs include Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield Healthcare Solutions (Elevance), SilverSummit Healthplan (Centene), Molina Healthcare of Nevada, and UnitedHealthcare Health Plan of Nevada.

In March 2025, Nevada announced intent to award new managed care contracts effective 2026, adding CareSource as a fifth MCO. UnitedHealthcare lost its contract for Washoe County but retained Clark County. The state is also expanding managed care statewide into rural areas that have been served through fee-for-service.

These MCOs will be responsible for much of the work requirement operational burden. Their contracts should include work verification capabilities, exemption processing support, and member engagement for compliance assistance. Whether the new contracts (anticipated to begin during the work requirement preparation period) include adequate provisions remains to be seen.

## Expected Approach

**Exemption Policy**

Nevada has not announced detailed exemption policies. Federal law exempts pregnant women, people with disabilities, and parents of children under 13. State discretion exists for additional exemptions and implementation details.

Given the state's high proportion of working Medicaid adults (67%), the practical exemption challenge may be smaller than in states with lower workforce participation. However, the variable-hours hospitality workforce may face month-to-month compliance uncertainty even when employed.

**Verification Infrastructure**

Nevada is participating in a seven-state pilot program for automated work hour reporting, described as a "no touch solution" that would eliminate manual reporting for compliant enrollees. The pilot's success would dramatically simplify implementation. Its failure would require building alternative verification systems from scratch.

State officials have engaged West Virginia University Health Affairs for project management and systems requirements development, suggesting awareness of the technical challenges ahead.

**Navigator Investment**

No substantial navigator investment has been announced. The Nevada Health Authority reorganization may create opportunities for integrated navigation across programs. The state's community health center network and Federally Qualified Health Centers could provide verification assistance infrastructure if resourced appropriately.

**Cross-Program Coordination**

Nevada operates SNAP and Medicaid through different divisions (Division of Welfare and Supportive Services for SNAP; Nevada Health Authority for Medicaid). SNAP already has work requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents (20 hours weekly or participation in employment programs). Coordination between SNAP and Medicaid work verification could reduce duplicate reporting burdens, though no coordination system currently exists.

## Cross-Program Context

**SNAP E&T**

Nevada operates a voluntary SNAP Employment and Training program through partnerships with the Nevada System of Higher Education. SNAP ABAWD work requirements apply (20 hours weekly), with three-month time limits for non-compliance. No formal coordination with Medicaid work verification exists.

**Provider Tax Situation**

Governor Lombardo has warned that lowering the safe harbor for hospital provider taxes would impose major financial burdens on Nevada's 43+ hospitals. Hospital provider taxes currently help fund the state Medicaid match. Any reduction would strain state fiscal capacity during work requirement implementation.

**Marketplace Infrastructure**

Nevada operates the Silver State Health Insurance Exchange (Nevada Health Link), which will be essential for providing coverage alternatives for individuals losing Medicaid eligibility. Enhanced ACA premium subsidies expire in 2025 under current law, though the state is implementing a reinsurance program to moderate premium increases.

Nevada Health Link premiums are projected to rise 26% for 2026, creating affordability barriers for individuals transitioning from Medicaid to marketplace coverage.

## Summary: What Nevada Is Expected to Do

Nevada will implement work requirements because federal law requires it, but the state's approach will likely emphasize administrative efficiency over enforcement intensity. The automated work hour reporting pilot, if successful, could minimize compliance burdens for employed enrollees. The state's high proportion of working Medicaid adults means most enrollees are already performing qualifying activities.

The critical challenges are verification for variable-hours hospitality workers and gig economy participants whose work patterns don't fit traditional payroll documentation. Nevada's tourism-dependent economy creates a workforce uniquely susceptible to hours fluctuations that could trigger coverage loss even among working individuals.

Projected coverage losses are substantial. State estimates suggest approximately 100,000 Nevadans could lose coverage in the first two years after implementation, representing roughly 12.5% of current Medicaid enrollment. The state's fiscal impact is projected at $60 million over five years, though this estimate may prove conservative.

The Nevada Health Authority reorganization creates both opportunity and risk. Coordination across Medicaid, marketplace, and workforce programs could enable smoother transitions and integrated support. But reorganizing during the preparation period for a major program change introduces execution risk.

For MCOs, employers, and community organizations, Nevada's implementation will require attention to the hospitality workforce's unique characteristics. Traditional employment verification assumes regular schedules, single employers, and documented hours. Nevada's dominant industry operates differently, and verification systems must accommodate that reality or coverage losses will exceed compliance failures.
