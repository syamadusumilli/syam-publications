## Work Requirement History

Minnesota has never implemented Medicaid work requirements. The state has consistently rejected work requirement approaches, viewing them as inconsistent with the state's tradition of generous public assistance and its philosophical commitment to healthcare as a fundamental need rather than an earned benefit.

**Early Expansion**

Minnesota was among the earliest Medicaid expansion states, with coverage beginning in 2014 under Governor Mark Dayton. The state had already established more generous Medicaid eligibility than most states prior to the Affordable Care Act, covering adults with dependent children up to 100% of the federal poverty level and childless adults up to 75% FPL. This foundation made expansion a natural extension of existing policy rather than a dramatic departure.

**MinnesotaCare Infrastructure**

Uniquely among states, Minnesota operates MinnesotaCare, a state-subsidized health coverage program for individuals earning between 138% and 200% of the federal poverty level who do not have access to employer-sponsored insurance. This Basic Health Program under the ACA creates a coverage bridge that other states lack. As of August 2025, approximately 101,000 Minnesotans were enrolled in MinnesotaCare. The program demonstrates Minnesota's commitment to comprehensive coverage infrastructure beyond federal minimums.

**Policy Philosophy**

The state's approach reflects a philosophical commitment that healthcare access should not be conditioned on employment status. DFL (Democratic-Farmer-Labor) leadership has consistently framed Medicaid as healthcare rather than welfare, resisting characterizations that would subject it to work-based eligibility criteria. This framing has broad institutional support across state agencies, provider systems, and advocacy organizations.

## Current Policy and Waiver Status

**Political Landscape**

Minnesota's political environment presents a complicated picture for work requirement implementation. Governor Tim Walz, a Democrat, has been vocally critical of federal Medicaid changes, characterizing the One Big Beautiful Bill Act as "a historic disinvestment in the health and wellbeing of Minnesotans" and calling work requirements "cruel" and based on "the biggest lie that has ever been perpetuated."

However, the legislature is closely divided. Following the 2024 elections, the Senate is tied 33-33 between Republicans and Democrats, and the GOP holds a narrow 67-66 majority in the House. This creates tension between executive resistance to aggressive implementation and legislative pressure for compliance with federal requirements.

**State Agency Position**

The Minnesota Department of Human Services has released detailed analyses of federal Medicaid changes, projecting that up to 140,000 Minnesotans will lose health coverage under the new requirements. State Medicaid Director John Connolly has emphasized that coverage losses will include people who meet work requirements but cannot successfully navigate reporting systems.

DHS estimates that work requirement implementation will generate annual administrative costs of $160 million for counties and tribal agencies, plus $5 million in state administrative costs. The department projects $200 million in reduced federal program funding and anticipates that 20% of those subject to requirements will lose coverage through non-compliance, administrative burden, or income changes.

**No Waiver Activity**

Minnesota has not submitted any Section 1115 waiver application related to work requirements and shows no indication of pursuing voluntary implementation beyond federal mandates. The state's approach will be compliance-oriented rather than enthusiastic, seeking to implement the minimum federal requirements while maximizing exemptions and minimizing coverage losses.

## Defining Characteristics

**County-Administered System**

Minnesota's Medicaid eligibility system is county-administered, meaning the state's 87 counties handle eligibility determinations, renewals, and case management. This decentralized structure creates both opportunities and challenges for work requirement implementation. County agencies have local knowledge and relationships but vary significantly in capacity, resources, and approach.

Matt Freeman, executive director of the Minnesota Association of County Social Service Administrators, has emphasized that work requirements are not embedded into county technology systems. Counties still manually process many applications. Building verification infrastructure across 87 counties with varying technical capacity represents a substantial implementation challenge.

The county-administered model also means that implementation quality will vary by location. Hennepin County's sophisticated human services infrastructure differs dramatically from Mahnomen County's limited administrative capacity. Urban counties may achieve higher compliance rates through better outreach and processing capabilities, while rural counties may struggle with the administrative burden.

**Robust Managed Care Infrastructure**

Minnesota operates Medical Assistance primarily through managed care organizations. The state contracts with multiple MCOs including Blue Plus, HealthPartners, UCare, Medica, UnitedHealthcare, and several county-based purchasers. This managed care infrastructure provides potential implementation capacity for member outreach and compliance support.

UCare serves more people from diverse cultures and more people with disabilities enrolled in Medical Assistance than any other health plan in Minnesota. This concentration creates both responsibility and capability for targeted outreach to vulnerable populations. MCOs have financial incentives to maintain enrollment, potentially aligning their interests with coverage-protective implementation.

**Linguistic Diversity Challenge**

Minnesota's refugee and immigrant populations create substantial language access requirements for work requirement implementation. The largest groups of foreign-born Minnesotans were born in Mexico, Somalia, India, Laos (including Hmong), Vietnam, China, and Ethiopia. Major languages spoken at home beyond English include Spanish, Somali, Hmong, Arabic, Vietnamese, Karen, and Oromo.

Somali-language and Hmong-language communications will be essential for effective outreach in the Twin Cities. The state already provides materials in multiple languages through MNsure and county human services offices, but work requirement verification adds new complexity to an already multilingual administrative challenge. Community organizations serving immigrant populations will be critical intermediaries.

**Tribal Exemptions**

Members of American Indian tribes are exempt from work requirements under federal law. Minnesota's eleven tribal nations include significant populations who will not face these requirements. However, the exemption creates administrative complexity in identifying and verifying tribal membership. The state has established government-to-government relationships with tribal nations that will require coordination for implementation.

White Earth Reservation, with over 19,000 enrolled members, operates its own health and social service programs. Red Lake Nation maintains a closed reservation with comprehensive tribal services. Implementation will require tribal consultation and coordination across all eleven nations to ensure exemptions are properly applied and tribal members are not incorrectly subjected to requirements.

## Expected Policy Posture and Timeline

**Compliance Under Protest**

Minnesota will implement federal work requirements because it must, but the Walz administration has signaled no intention to exceed federal minimums or pursue aggressive enforcement. The state is expected to:

Maximize federal exemptions. Every categorical exemption permitted under federal law will be applied. The state will likely interpret exemption criteria broadly, including for caregivers, people with medical conditions, and those experiencing hardship.

Prioritize deemed compliance. Minnesota will pursue automatic satisfaction of Medicaid work requirements for individuals already meeting SNAP or TANF work requirements. This cross-program coordination reduces verification burden for individuals enrolled in multiple programs.

Minimize reporting frequency. If federal regulations permit state discretion on verification timing, Minnesota will choose the least frequent option to reduce administrative burden on both enrollees and county workers.

Invest in navigation. The state will likely invest in navigator infrastructure to help enrollees understand requirements, document compliance, and access exemptions. This approach aligns with Minnesota's existing commitment to enrollment assistance.

**Implementation Timeline**

Federal work requirements take effect December 31, 2026, with states permitted to request two-year extensions if demonstrating good faith implementation efforts. Minnesota's timeline will likely include:

Late 2025 to early 2026: Federal regulatory guidance development; state planning begins
First half of 2026: System development; county staff training; navigator partnerships established
Second half of 2026: Member communications; reporting system activation; pilot testing
December 2026: Federal requirement effective date
2027: Full implementation with ongoing refinement

Whether Minnesota will request an extension depends on implementation progress and political calculations. An extension delays coverage losses but also delays federal compliance, potentially creating political vulnerability.

**Fiscal Impact Management**

DHS projects that federal Medicaid changes will cost Minnesota $1.4 billion in federal funding over four years, with losses deepening over time to potentially $2.5 billion per biennium when fully implemented. The state budget will need to address these losses in the 2026 legislative session.

Governor Walz has already proposed budget measures to address structural deficits, including slowing growth in disability services spending. Work requirement implementation costs will compound existing fiscal pressures. Counties will bear substantial implementation costs, creating potential unfunded mandate concerns.

## Summary: What Minnesota Is Expected to Do

Minnesota will implement federal work requirements reluctantly, viewing them as an unwanted federal mandate rather than sound policy. The Walz administration will maximize exemptions, pursue cross-program deemed compliance, and invest in navigation support to minimize coverage losses.

The state's county-administered eligibility system creates implementation complexity. The 87 counties vary dramatically in capacity, from Hennepin County's sophisticated human services infrastructure to rural northern counties with minimal administrative resources. Implementation quality will vary geographically, potentially creating coverage disparities based on county of residence.

Minnesota's diverse immigrant and refugee populations present unique outreach challenges. Somali, Hmong, and other communities will require culturally competent, multilingual communications and trusted community intermediaries. The state's robust community-based organization infrastructure provides potential capacity, but mobilizing these networks for work requirement compliance represents new territory.

Tribal exemptions will require careful coordination with eleven sovereign nations. The federal exemption protects tribal members, but administrative systems must correctly identify and flag tribal enrollment to prevent improper subjection to requirements.

The political dynamics create tension between gubernatorial resistance and legislative pressure. With a divided legislature, Minnesota cannot unilaterally choose coverage-protective approaches that exceed federal minimums in generosity. Implementation decisions will reflect political compromise rather than pure policy preferences.

Minnesota's managed care infrastructure provides implementation capacity. MCOs have member contact information, communication channels, and financial incentives to maintain enrollment. Whether this infrastructure can be effectively mobilized for compliance support will significantly affect outcomes.

**The Open Question**

Minnesota enters work requirement implementation as a reluctant participant, philosophically opposed to conditioning healthcare on employment but legally required to comply. The state's progressive policy tradition, robust safety net infrastructure, and diverse population create both resources and challenges for implementation.

Whether Minnesota can achieve compliance rates that prevent the projected 140,000 coverage losses depends on factors within and beyond state control. Federal regulatory flexibility, county administrative capacity, MCO engagement, community organization mobilization, and enrollee response to requirements will all affect outcomes.

Minnesota's experience will demonstrate whether a state that views work requirements as fundamentally misguided can nonetheless implement them in ways that minimize harm. The answer has implications for the 40 other expansion states facing similar mandates with varying levels of political enthusiasm.

## Cross-Program Context

**SNAP E&T Alignment**

Minnesota operates SNAP Employment & Training programs that may provide deemed compliance pathways for Medicaid work requirements. Individuals meeting SNAP work requirements would automatically satisfy Medicaid requirements, reducing verification burden. The extent of this alignment depends on federal regulatory guidance.

**TANF Work Requirements**

Minnesota's TANF program, called Minnesota Family Investment Program (MFIP), includes work requirements for cash assistance recipients. TANF work requirement participants are explicitly exempt from Medicaid work requirements under federal law, eliminating duplication for families receiving both benefits.

**MinnesotaCare Coverage Pathway**

Expansion adults losing Medicaid coverage may qualify for MinnesotaCare if their income remains below 200% FPL. This state-funded program provides a coverage bridge unavailable in most states. However, MinnesotaCare requires premiums (up to $80/month in 2026) and may not qualify for federal Basic Health Program funding depending on other legislative changes.

**Provider Tax Constraints**

Minnesota relies significantly on provider taxes for Medicaid financing. Federal changes reducing provider tax limits from 6% to 3.5% for expansion states will constrain state financing options. DHS estimates hospitals may eventually lose approximately $1 billion annually when the safe harbor limit is fully phased down. This fiscal pressure may affect the state's ability to invest in work requirement implementation infrastructure.
