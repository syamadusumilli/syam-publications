## Work Requirement History

Kansas has no prior experience implementing Medicaid work requirements because the state has never expanded Medicaid. Kansas remains one of only ten states that have not adopted the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion, leaving approximately 27,000-39,000 adults in the coverage gap, earning too little to qualify for marketplace subsidies but too much (or in the wrong category) to qualify for traditional Medicaid.

**Legislative Attempts**

Governor Laura Kelly, a Democrat elected in 2018 and reelected in 2022, has proposed Medicaid expansion every year of her administration. Each proposal has included work requirements as a compromise designed to attract Republican support from the legislature, which Republicans have controlled throughout Kelly's tenure.

The Healthcare Access for Working Kansans (HAWK) Act, introduced in February 2025, represents the most recent attempt. The bill would expand KanCare to adults earning up to 138% of the federal poverty level, conditioned on demonstrating 80 hours monthly of work, education, job training, or community service. Exemptions would include pregnancy, disability, and student status. Analysis by the Kansas Health Institute estimated that work requirements would reduce expected enrollment by approximately 20,000 people compared to expansion without such requirements.

**Legislative Dynamics**

Despite polling showing that nearly 72% of Kansans support Medicaid expansion, the Republican-controlled legislature has repeatedly blocked expansion legislation. Senate President Ty Masterson, a candidate for governor in 2026, has stated that he does not believe expansion is possible under the current legislature and has argued that expansion has not helped rural hospitals in other states.

In 2024, Republican leadership allowed committee hearings on expansion legislation for the first time in four years, suggesting some softening of opposition, but the bills did not advance to floor votes. The 2025 legislative session adjourned without acting on the HAWK Act.

**Historical Context**

Kansas's resistance to expansion follows broader Republican opposition to the Affordable Care Act, but also reflects specific concerns about long-term costs and federal funding reliability. The state's conservative legislative leadership has consistently argued that Medicaid expansion diverts resources from traditional Medicaid populations including children, pregnant women, and people with disabilities.

## Current Policy and Waiver Status

**Non-Expansion Status**

Kansas has not submitted a Section 1115 waiver for Medicaid expansion with or without work requirements. As a non-expansion state, Kansas does not currently face the federal work requirement mandate established by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which applies specifically to adults covered through the ACA Medicaid expansion.

**KanCare 3.0**

Kansas operates its Medicaid program through KanCare, a managed care model implemented in 2013. The state awarded contracts for KanCare 3.0, effective January 2025 through December 2027, to three managed care organizations: Sunflower Health Plan (Centene), UnitedHealthcare Community Plan, and Healthy Blue (Anthem). These MCOs serve the approximately 358,000-458,000 Kansans enrolled in traditional Medicaid categories.

**Federal Policy Implications**

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act creates a complex dynamic for Kansas. The work requirement provisions do not apply to Kansas because the state has no expansion population. However, other provisions affect Kansas's existing Medicaid program:

The provider tax caps will constrain Kansas's ability to finance its state share of Medicaid costs, though the state has relatively modest dependence on provider taxes compared to states like California or New York.

The elimination of American Rescue Plan Act incentives means Kansas forfeits the two-year, five-percentage-point FMAP bonus that was available to states that newly expanded Medicaid. This changes the financial calculus for any future expansion decision.

The semi-annual redetermination requirement applies only to expansion adults, so Kansas's current annual redetermination cycle for traditional populations remains unchanged.

## Defining Characteristics

**The Rural Hospital Crisis**

Kansas has the highest percentage of rural hospitals at risk of closure of any state in the nation. According to the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform, 67 of Kansas's approximately 100 rural hospitals (67%) are at risk of closing, with 30-31 at immediate risk of closure within two to three years. Eight rural hospitals have closed since 2015; eleven communities have lost inpatient care since 2010.

The rural hospital crisis creates both an argument for and against Medicaid expansion. Expansion advocates, including Governor Kelly and the Kansas Hospital Association, argue that covering the uninsured population would reduce uncompensated care costs that strain rural facilities. Opponents counter that expansion would not solve the fundamental problem of inadequate reimbursement rates and that rural hospitals in expansion states continue to struggle.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act's Medicaid cuts will affect Kansas's rural hospitals regardless of expansion status. Rural facilities will see reduced Medicaid reimbursements for the populations they currently serve, estimated at a 15% reduction in total rural Medicaid hospital reimbursement under the enacted legislation.

**Administrative Infrastructure**

Kansas operates a state-administered Medicaid program through the Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE), with eligibility determination handled through the Kansas Eligibility Enforcement System (KEES). The state has invested in technology infrastructure through KanCare but has not developed the verification systems that would be required for work requirement implementation.

If Kansas eventually expands with work requirements, it would need to build verification infrastructure from scratch. The state has no experience with Medicaid work verification, unlike states like Georgia or Michigan that developed (with varying success) systems during prior implementation attempts.

**SNAP Coordination Infrastructure**

Kansas has extensive experience with SNAP work requirements through its ABAWD (Able-Bodied Adults Without Dependents) program. The state's Department for Children and Families operates Employment and Training programs requiring 80 hours monthly of work, training, or volunteer activities for SNAP recipients. This infrastructure could theoretically be leveraged for Medicaid work verification if the state expanded coverage with work requirements, creating potential for deemed compliance across programs.

The OB3 expansion of SNAP work requirements to ages 55-64 and parents with children 14 and older means approximately 5,500 additional Kansans face food assistance work requirements starting November 2025.

**Political Environment**

Kansas presents a divided political environment. Governor Kelly represents a Democratic governorship in a state that votes Republican at the federal level and maintains Republican supermajorities in the legislature. This dynamic has prevented expansion despite consistent gubernatorial support.

The 2026 gubernatorial election may be pivotal. Senate President Masterson's candidacy positions Medicaid expansion as a potential campaign issue. If Republicans maintain the governorship, expansion becomes increasingly unlikely. A Democratic successor to Kelly would face the same legislative obstacles that have blocked expansion throughout her tenure.

Kansas's political environment also reflects a broader tension between urban and rural interests. Johnson County and the Kansas City suburbs trend more moderate, while rural western Kansas remains strongly conservative. Rural hospital closures create pressure for action, but rural legislators have not translated this pressure into support for expansion.

**Tribal Considerations**

Kansas's four federally recognized tribes operate their own health programs with varying levels of integration with state systems. The Indian Health Service provides healthcare to enrolled tribal members, but coverage gaps exist. If Kansas expanded Medicaid, tribal members in the coverage gap would become eligible, and any work requirement policy would need to address tribal exemptions consistent with federal Indian law principles.

## Expected Policy Posture and Timeline

**Near-Term Outlook**

Kansas is unlikely to expand Medicaid before the 2026 gubernatorial election. The Republican legislature has shown no willingness to pass expansion legislation despite Governor Kelly's persistent advocacy. The elimination of ARPA incentives under OB3 may further reduce legislative interest by eliminating the enhanced federal funding that previously sweetened the financial case for expansion.

**Potential Post-2026 Scenarios**

If a Republican wins the 2026 gubernatorial race, expansion becomes highly improbable for the foreseeable future. Kansas would join the small group of states that permanently decline expansion, maintaining its coverage gap indefinitely.

If a Democrat wins and if political dynamics shift in the legislature, expansion remains possible but would almost certainly include work requirements as the price of Republican support. The HAWK Act model, with 80-hour monthly requirements and exemptions for pregnancy, disability, and student status, represents the likely template.

**Implementation Challenges If Expansion Occurs**

Should Kansas eventually expand Medicaid with work requirements, the state would face compressed timelines and significant infrastructure challenges:

Building verification systems from scratch would require substantial technology investment. Kansas has not developed the automated data matching, employer verification, or reporting portal systems that work requirements demand. Georgia's experience spending over $100 million on technology that largely failed to function provides a cautionary example.

The state would need to train eligibility workers on new requirements while simultaneously enrolling a new population. The compressed December 2026 federal deadline leaves minimal runway for states that have not already begun preparation.

Rural Kansas presents particular verification challenges. Western Kansas counties with declining populations have limited employment opportunities and minimal broadband infrastructure. Requiring rural residents to document 80 hours of qualifying activities monthly may prove practically impossible in frontier communities.

**Federal Pressure**

Future federal policy could accelerate expansion decisions. If Congress conditions other Medicaid funding on expansion adoption, or if the administrative burden provisions of OB3 prove untenable for non-expansion states, Kansas might face pressure to reconsider. However, the current political alignment suggests Kansas will resist such pressure as long as feasible.

## Summary: What Kansas Is Expected to Do

Kansas will almost certainly remain a non-expansion state through at least 2027, maintaining its coverage gap of approximately 27,000-39,000 adults and avoiding the work requirement mandate that applies only to expansion populations. The Republican legislature has consistently blocked expansion despite gubernatorial support, and the elimination of ARPA incentives reduces any remaining financial urgency.

The state's rural hospital crisis will continue regardless of expansion decisions. Kansas hospitals face the highest closure risk in the nation, and OB3 Medicaid cuts will strain facilities further even without expansion. This crisis may eventually force reconsideration, but legislative action appears unlikely under current political alignment.

If Kansas eventually expands, work requirements will almost certainly be included as a compromise to secure Republican support. The HAWK Act framework, with 80-hour monthly requirements and exemptions modeled on SNAP, provides the template. However, the state would need to build verification infrastructure from scratch, creating significant implementation risk.

Kansas's existing SNAP work requirement infrastructure offers potential coordination benefits. The state already operates 80-hour monthly requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents, and deemed compliance between programs could reduce duplication. Whether this coordination opportunity would be realized depends entirely on whether expansion occurs.

The 2026 gubernatorial election represents the most significant near-term variable. A Republican victory would likely close the expansion window indefinitely; a Democratic victory would maintain the possibility of expansion but not guarantee legislative success. Kansas demonstrates how state political dynamics can override federal policy incentives, leaving residents in the coverage gap regardless of federal work requirement mandates that would apply if they had coverage.

## Cross-Program Context

**SNAP Employment and Training**

Kansas operates mandatory SNAP Employment and Training programs through the Department for Children and Families. The state's ABAWD requirements mirror the 80-hour monthly threshold that would apply under Medicaid work requirements, creating potential for cross-program coordination. However, without expansion, this coordination remains hypothetical.

**TANF Work Requirements**

Kansas's TANF program includes work requirements for families receiving cash assistance. The state's TANF-to-Work program operates separately from SNAP E&T but uses similar verification approaches.

**Provider Tax Structure**

Kansas has relatively modest dependence on provider taxes compared to states with more aggressive Medicaid financing strategies. The OB3 provider tax caps will constrain state options but create less immediate fiscal pressure than in states like New York or California where provider taxes represent larger shares of state Medicaid financing.

**Marketplace Infrastructure**

Kansas uses the federally facilitated marketplace (HealthCare.gov) for individual health insurance enrollment. Enhanced ACA subsidies, if maintained, provide coverage options for people earning above 100% FPL. However, subsidy expiration would leave more Kansans uninsured and increase pressure on the existing coverage gap population.
