## Work Requirement History

Utah's work requirement history intertwines with a contested Medicaid expansion saga that pitted voter initiative against legislative modification.

**Proposition 3: The Voter Mandate (2018)**

In November 2018, Utah voters approved Proposition 3, a ballot initiative mandating full Medicaid expansion to 138% FPL under the Affordable Care Act. The measure passed 53% to 47%, reflecting voter support for expansion despite Utah's conservative political environment.

Proposition 3 did not include work requirements. Voters approved straightforward expansion: adults under 138% FPL would receive Medicaid coverage, period.

**Senate Bill 96: The Legislative Override (2019)**

The Utah Legislature, uncomfortable with voter-mandated expansion, passed Senate Bill 96 in February 2019. The bill modified Proposition 3 in several ways:

*Partial Expansion:* Rather than expanding to 138% FPL as voters directed, SB 96 initially limited expansion to 100% FPL, pending federal waiver approval for full expansion with modifications.

*Work Requirements:* SB 96 added work requirements that voters had not approved. Adults ages 19-59 would face community engagement requirements unless exempt.

*Enrollment Caps:* The legislation included provisions allowing enrollment caps if costs exceeded projections, limiting the open-ended entitlement voters had approved.

*Waiver Contingency:* Full expansion was contingent on CMS approving the state's Section 1115 waiver with work requirements and other modifications.

**The Waiver Application**

Utah submitted its Section 1115 waiver in March 2019 seeking approval for:
- Full expansion to 138% FPL (as voters mandated)
- Work requirements for non-exempt adults (as legislature added)
- Enrollment caps (as legislature added)
- Premium requirements for higher-income enrollees

The work requirement design included:
- 48 hours monthly of qualifying activities (lower than federal 80-hour standard)
- Exemptions for disability, pregnancy, caregiving, students, and medical frailty
- Phase-in starting with new enrollees, then extending to existing enrollees
- Verification through self-attestation with documentation available for audit

**Partial Approval and Full Expansion (2020)**

CMS approved Utah's waiver in part. The enrollment cap was approved; work requirements were not immediately implemented due to litigation outcomes in other states creating uncertainty.

In January 2020, Utah began covering adults up to 138% FPL without work requirements, effectively implementing what voters had approved in Proposition 3 but through a modified waiver pathway.

**COVID-19 Suspension**

The pandemic's continuous enrollment requirement suspended any work requirement implementation. Utah's expansion population grew substantially during the pandemic as economic disruption increased eligibility.

**Post-Pandemic Status**

Utah never implemented work requirements. The waiver authority existed, but implementation was suspended first by legal uncertainty, then by the pandemic. The state completed Medicaid unwinding in 2023-2024, returning to normal eligibility processes, but work requirements remained unimplemented.

## Current Policy and Waiver Status

**2025 Planning Activity**

Utah is among states in "various stages of planning" for work requirement implementation under the federal mandate. The state's prior waiver provides a foundation, but the federal requirement differs from Utah's 2019 design in important ways.

Key differences between Utah's 2019 proposal and federal OB3 requirements:

*Hour Threshold:* Utah proposed 48 hours monthly; federal requirement is 80 hours monthly. Utah would need to align with the higher federal standard or demonstrate equivalence through alternative measures.

*Verification Frequency:* Utah proposed periodic verification; federal requirement specifies semi-annual redetermination with work requirement verification.

*Implementation Timeline:* Utah's waiver contemplated gradual phase-in; federal mandate requires implementation by December 2026.

**Current Waiver Modification Process**

Utah submitted a waiver modification in 2025 to align its existing Section 1115 demonstration with federal work requirement provisions. The modification seeks to:

- Update hour requirements to 80 monthly (or equivalent alternative)
- Align verification timing with federal semi-annual redetermination
- Maintain state-specific exemptions while meeting federal minimums
- Incorporate lessons from other states' implementation experiences

**Legislative Context**

Utah's Republican-controlled legislature supports work requirements and has since 2019. The modification of Proposition 3 to add work requirements reflected legislative priority, not voter mandate. Current legislative posture remains supportive of implementation.

Governor Spencer Cox has indicated support for work requirements while emphasizing implementation should minimize administrative burden and coverage disruption.

## Defining Characteristics

**The Ballot Initiative Tension**

Utah's defining characteristic is the tension between voter mandate and legislative modification. Voters approved expansion without work requirements; the legislature added requirements voters didn't authorize. This creates a legitimacy question that other states don't face.

The political dynamics:
- Voters clearly supported expansion (53%)
- Voters did not vote on work requirements
- Legislature added requirements after voters decided
- Courts upheld legislative authority to modify initiatives
- The moral authority of voter mandate versus legislative override remains contested

This tension affects implementation politics. Advocacy organizations that supported Proposition 3 oppose work requirements as contrary to voter intent. Legislative supporters argue that modification authority is constitutional and that work requirements reflect Utah values.

**LDS Cultural Context**

Utah's dominant Latter-day Saint culture shapes work requirement politics in distinctive ways:

*Self-Sufficiency Emphasis:* LDS theology and culture emphasize self-reliance and productive work. This cultural framework provides ideological support for conditioning benefits on work.

*Welfare Square Model:* The LDS Church operates its own welfare system emphasizing work requirements for assistance. Church members may view government work requirements as consistent with familiar institutional practice.

*Community Support Networks:* LDS ward and stake structures provide informal support networks that may help members navigate work requirements. Non-LDS Utahns, particularly refugees and immigrants, lack equivalent community infrastructure.

*Charitable Giving Patterns:* Utah has among the highest charitable giving rates nationally (largely tithing). This may reduce political pressure for government assistance expansion.

**Refugee and Immigrant Populations**

Salt Lake City hosts significant refugee resettlement, creating populations with distinctive work requirement challenges:

*Language Barriers:* Refugees from Burma, Congo, Syria, and elsewhere may have limited English proficiency. Verification systems requiring English documentation create barriers.

*Employment Documentation:* Refugees often work in industries (meatpacking, hospitality, janitorial) where documentation practices may be informal. Employer verification may be difficult to obtain.

*Cultural Unfamiliarity:* Work requirement systems reflect American administrative assumptions. Refugees from different governmental traditions may struggle to navigate verification processes.

*Resettlement Agency Support:* Catholic Community Services, International Rescue Committee, and other resettlement agencies provide navigation support. Whether this capacity can scale to work requirement verification is uncertain.

**Rural Isolation**

Rural Utah faces extreme isolation that affects work requirement implementation:

*Distance Barriers:* Some rural Utahns live 100+ miles from workforce development offices or verification support services.

*Limited Employment:* Rural county economies depend on agriculture, mining, and tourism. Employment opportunities are seasonal and limited.

*Federal Land Constraints:* With 65% of Utah under federal land management, private sector development opportunities are constrained in rural areas.

*Tribal Complications:* Navajo Nation and Ute tribal lands have distinct employment patterns and verification challenges similar to Arizona's tribal populations.

**Strong Economy Context**

Like Iowa, Utah implements work requirements in a labor shortage environment:

*Tech Sector Growth:* Silicon Slopes companies cannot fill positions. Employment opportunities exist for workers with relevant skills.

*Service Sector Demand:* Tourism, hospitality, and healthcare face persistent labor shortages. Jobs exist; workers are scarce.

*Wage Pressure:* Despite following federal minimum wage, effective wages are much higher due to labor market competition.

This context means most expansion adults who can work are likely already working. Work requirements become documentation requirements for an employed population rather than employment incentives for a non-working population.

## Expected Policy Posture and Timeline

**Anticipated Approach: Moderate with Administrative Efficiency Emphasis**

Utah's expected implementation philosophy emphasizes administrative efficiency over enforcement maximization. The state's strong economy means most expansion adults are working; the policy challenge is verification without creating unnecessary burden.

Expected elements:

*Data Matching Priority:* Utah will likely emphasize automated verification through wage data, similar to Ohio's approach. The state's relatively small expansion population makes automated approaches feasible.

*Self-Attestation Baseline:* Utah's original proposal relied on self-attestation with documentation available for audit. This approach may continue, reducing upfront verification burden.

*Refugee Accommodation:* Given Salt Lake City's refugee population, the state will need culturally appropriate verification pathways. Resettlement agency partnerships may provide verification support.

*Tribal Exemptions:* Following Arizona's model, Utah will likely provide exemptions or alternative arrangements for tribal populations.

**Timeline**

- 2025: Waiver modification submitted and under review
- Late 2025: CMS approval anticipated
- Early 2026: System development and testing
- Mid-2026: Implementation preparation; outreach to members
- December 2026: Full implementation aligned with federal deadline

**Key Uncertainties**

*Hour Threshold Alignment:* Whether Utah can maintain its 48-hour concept through activity credits or must adopt the full 80-hour federal standard will affect implementation burden.

*Refugee Population Outcomes:* How effectively verification systems serve non-English-speaking refugees will test Utah's inclusive implementation claims.

*Rural Implementation:* Whether the state can meaningfully implement work requirements in counties with minimal employment opportunities remains uncertain.

*Proposition 3 Legacy:* Whether the ballot initiative tension affects public acceptance and member cooperation with requirements is unknown.

## Summary: What Utah Is Expected to Do

Utah will implement work requirements building on its 2019 waiver foundation, modified to align with federal OB3 standards. The state's approach will likely emphasize administrative efficiency over aggressive enforcement, reflecting both the strong economy context (most people are already working) and the practical challenges of verification in a geographically diverse state.

The ballot initiative legacy creates political complexity other states don't face. Voters approved expansion without work requirements; the legislature added requirements voters didn't authorize. This legitimacy tension may affect implementation politics and member cooperation.

Utah's relatively small expansion population (90,000-120,000) allows more personalized implementation than large states can achieve. Data matching and self-attestation can function at this scale. The challenge is serving populations whose circumstances don't fit administrative categories: refugees navigating unfamiliar systems, rural residents in areas without employment, tribal members with distinctive verification needs.

The state's strong economy suggests that work requirements will function primarily as documentation requirements for an already-employed population. Whether this produces compliance without coverage loss or creates administrative barriers that separate employed people from coverage depends on implementation quality.

## Cross-Program Context

**SNAP Coordination**

Utah operates SNAP through the Department of Workforce Services, the same agency handling Medicaid eligibility. SNAP ABAWD requirements affect overlapping populations. Deemed compliance provisions could reduce duplicate verification burden.

**TANF Work Requirements**

Utah's Family Employment Program (TANF) includes work requirements with established workforce development partnerships. Infrastructure from TANF supports Medicaid implementation.

**Department of Workforce Services Integration**

Utah's unique administrative structure places Medicaid eligibility within the Department of Workforce Services rather than a health agency. This integration facilitates workforce development coordination but may emphasize employment over healthcare access in program culture.

**Tribal Coordination**

Navajo Nation, Ute Mountain Ute, and Uintah and Ouray reservations require coordination similar to Arizona. Tribal exemptions and tribal administration alternatives need development.

**Refugee Resettlement Partnerships**

Resettlement agencies (Catholic Community Services, International Rescue Committee, Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service) provide established relationships with refugee populations. These partnerships could support work requirement navigation.
