# The Systems View: Emergence, Incentives, and State Variation

*How work requirements create complex adaptive systems with predictable—yet unintended—consequences*

## Beyond Good Intentions: Policy as Complex System

When Arkansas implemented Medicaid work requirements in June 2018, state officials anticipated promoting employment and personal responsibility. What they got instead was 18,000 people losing coverage in 10 months—with no measurable increase in employment. When Georgia launched its Pathways program in July 2023, it projected enrolling 50,000 people. After 18 months, enrollment stood at just 6,500—while administrative costs exceeded $91 million.

These weren't implementation failures in the traditional sense. State agencies followed procedures, built technology systems, created exemption processes, and conducted outreach. The problem ran deeper: work requirements create **complex adaptive systems** where well-designed policies produce emergent behaviors no single actor planned or controls.

Understanding work requirements through a systems lens reveals why the same policy framework generates radically different outcomes across states, why attempted solutions often amplify underlying problems, and where strategic interventions might actually change system dynamics rather than just tinker at the margins.

## The Laboratory of Democracy: State Variation as Natural Experiment

OB3 establishes federal requirements but leaves substantial implementation discretion to states. This creates what political scientists call a "laboratory of democracy"—50 states experimenting with different approaches. But unlike controlled laboratory experiments, these natural experiments occur in dynamic systems where choices interact in complex ways.

### Arkansas 2018: The Cautionary Tale

**Design Choices:**
- Monthly reporting requirement (80 hours per month)
- Online portal only (phone option added December 2018)
- Report by the 5th of following month or lose coverage
- Applied to expansion adults age 19-49
- Exemptions: Medical frailty, caregiver status, pregnancy, student status
- Three consecutive months of non-compliance → coverage termination

**System Dynamics:**
- State successfully data-matched 2/3 of enrollees (exempting them from reporting)
- Among remaining 1/3 requiring active reporting: 70% didn't report or obtain exemptions
- Research showed most non-reporters were actually working or exempt
- Barriers: Digital divide, confusion about requirements, missed deadlines
- No employment increases detected

**Emergent Pattern:** The system optimized for identifying non-compliance rather than facilitating compliance. Each month, people who were working lost coverage because they couldn't navigate the reporting system.

### Georgia 2023-Present: The Ongoing Experiment

**Design Choices:**
- Monthly reporting at application and renewal (no monthly verification)
- 80 hours per month requirement
- Premium payments required ($25-$100/month)
- Applied to newly eligible adults up to 100% FPL
- No caregiver exemption
- Pathways as alternative to full Medicaid expansion

**System Dynamics:**
- Enrollment far below projections (6,500 vs. 50,000 projected)
- Administrative costs dwarf coverage spending ($91M total, >$50M on verification system)
- Website glitches and processing delays
- Confusion about exemption processes
- People who qualify choosing not to enroll due to complexity

**Emergent Pattern:** The system created such high entry barriers that eligible people self-selected out. The goal was expanding coverage with work requirements; the result was minimal expansion at maximum administrative cost.

### Georgia 2025: Learning Through Iteration

**Recent Adaptation (October 2025):** Georgia is now implementing significant refinements based on two years of experience. CMS approved an extension through December 2026 with substantial modifications that reveal what the system taught state policymakers:

**Key Changes:**
- **Reporting frequency reduced**: From monthly to only at application and annual renewal
- **Caregiver exemption added**: Parents/legal guardians of children under 6 now exempt
- **Retroactive coverage**: Coverage begins first day of month application received (not after approval)
- **Copayments introduced**: Variable based on service type

**What These Changes Reveal:**

**The Monthly Reporting Failure**: Georgia's initial design required monthly verification of 80 hours. The 2025 shift to annual reporting acknowledges that monthly verification created overwhelming administrative burden for both enrollees and the state—without achieving program integrity goals. People were losing coverage not for failing to work, but for failing to document it monthly.

**Systems Insight**: This represents recognition that measurement frequency trades off against measurement accuracy. More frequent checks don't produce better compliance—they produce more administrative errors and coverage churn.

**The Caregiving Recognition**: Excluding parents of young children from work requirements initially reflected a narrow definition of "qualifying activities." Adding caregiving exemption for parents of children under 6 acknowledges:
- Childcare costs often exceed potential earnings for low-wage work
- Parenting is economically valuable even if unpaid
- Young children require intensive supervision incompatible with 80-hour work months
- Previous design created impossible choice: Work to keep healthcare vs. care for child

**Systems Insight**: The exemption emerged not from philosophy but from practical failure—too many parents lost coverage, creating political pressure. System adaptation followed dysfunction.

**The Retroactive Coverage Addition**: Original design meant people could be approved but have weeks-long coverage gaps while application processed. Retroactive coverage to application date acknowledges:
- Administrative processing time shouldn't determine coverage start
- People need healthcare during the application period
- Gap coverage creates emergency department utilization and uncompensated care
- Other Medicaid categories already have retroactive coverage

**Systems Insight**: This change reveals tension between "personal responsibility" framing (coverage after you prove worthiness) and healthcare system function (people get sick during processing delays).

**The Copayment Introduction**: Adding copayments while removing monthly reporting and premium requirements shows complex trade-offs:
- State needed to maintain "personal responsibility" signal after removing monthly verification
- Copayments create different kind of participation burden (financial vs. administrative)
- May reduce administrative costs but could also reduce utilization
- Preserves symbolic reciprocity while simplifying compliance

**What Georgia Kept Despite Challenges:**
- 80-hour monthly requirement (even though verification is annual)
- Income limit at 100% FPL (no expansion to higher incomes)
- Age restrictions (19-64)
- Program as alternative to full Medicaid expansion (no enhanced federal match)

**What Georgia Added for Accommodations:**

**Reasonable Modifications** (State-granted flexibilities):
- Up to 90 additional days to meet reporting requirements at application
- Up to 90 days of maintained coverage during GVRA (Georgia Vocational Rehabilitation Agency) intake process for individuals with disabilities
- Adjusted minimum hours for individuals who cannot meet 80-hour requirement due to disability with employer/institution verification
- Good Cause Exceptions for single-month inability to complete hours due to qualifying emergency or life event

**Reasonable Accommodations** (Employer/institution-granted):
- Workplace modifications allowing reduced hours due to disability
- Reported to state only if hours fall below 80/month threshold
- State then adjusts required hours accordingly to maintain eligibility

**Lookback Period**: At application and annual renewal, individuals must demonstrate 80 hours of qualifying activities for "the most recent four weeks available"—creating a one-month lookback rather than requiring ongoing documentation throughout the year.

**Systems Insight on Accommodations**: These modifications reveal the system trying to address disability access without fundamentally changing program structure. The 90-day extensions and hour adjustments create complexity (caseworkers must process individual modification requests, track timelines, verify disabilities) while attempting to prevent disabled individuals from losing coverage. Question remains: Will people know to request modifications? Will caseworkers grant them consistently? Will 90 days suffice for GVRA processes that often take longer?

**The Seasonal Work Challenge**: Georgia's current policy doesn't explicitly address seasonal workers (agriculture, tourism, retail), though the annual reporting with four-week lookback could theoretically accommodate seasonal variation. However:
- Seasonal workers may meet 80-hour threshold during employment season but not off-season
- Annual verification timing matters—applying during work season vs. off-season produces different results
- No clear guidance on how to handle seasonal work patterns
- System design assumes consistent monthly work availability

**Emergent Pattern from Georgia's Evolution**: The system is adapting toward administrative simplicity while maintaining ideological commitments. Monthly reporting failed operationally but annual requirement plus initial verification preserves policy intent. The accommodation framework creates safety valves for individual cases but doesn't address systemic barriers. The question is whether annual verification will prove more workable or simply move problems to different points in the system.

### Arkansas 2025: Learning or Repeating?

**New Proposal Design:**
- Suspension (not termination) for non-compliance
- "Success coaches" for people struggling to comply
- Enhanced data matching to reduce reporting burden
- Benefits suspended through end of calendar year (not permanently terminated)

**Intended Improvements:**
- Less harsh penalties (suspension vs. termination)
- More support services (success coaches)
- Better automation (improved data matching)

**Systems Question:** Do these changes address root causes (system complexity, capacity barriers) or just make the dysfunction less visible? Suspension still means no healthcare access; coaches still require people to navigate complexity; data matching still creates errors.

### Ohio's Proposed Model: The Data-Driven Approach

**Design Choices:**
- Use existing data from other programs (unemployment, SNAP, education databases)
- Minimize individual reporting burden through automation
- Job training and employment support integration
- Focus on exemption identification upfront

**Hypothesis:** If reporting burden was the problem, eliminate reporting through automated verification.

**Systems Risk:** Data matching sounds elegant but creates new problems:
- Gig workers and informal employment don't appear in databases
- System errors become invisible (no human review)
- False negatives (system says you're not working when you are)
- False positives (system says you're exempt when you're not)
- Privacy concerns about inter-agency data sharing

### The Variation That Matters

States vary across multiple dimensions:

**Hourly Requirements:**
- Range: 20-100 hours/month
- Typical: 80 hours/month
- Trade-off: Lower hours = easier compliance but weaker "work signal"; Higher hours = stronger expectations but higher barriers

**Reporting Frequency:**
- Monthly (Arkansas 2018): Maximum administrative burden, fastest detection of non-compliance
- Quarterly: Reduced burden but longer periods without coverage if errors occur
- Annual (Georgia proposed): Mimics other government programs but delays help for people who need it

**Exemption Breadth:**
- Narrow (Georgia current): Few exemptions = cleaner policy but excludes vulnerable
- Broad (most proposals): Many exemptions = better protection but complex navigation
- Dynamic (some proposals): Exemptions adjust based on economic conditions

**Technology Approach:**
- Manual reporting (Arkansas 2018): Accessible to digital natives, excludes others
- Automated data matching (Ohio proposal): Efficient but error-prone
- Hybrid (most realistic): Some automation, human review for exceptions

**Support Services:**
- Minimal (Georgia current): Low cost, high coverage loss
- Moderate (Arkansas 2025 proposal): Success coaches, but still individual responsibility
- Comprehensive (not yet tried): Integrated employment services, childcare, transportation

**High Unemployment Exemptions:**
- OB3 acknowledges reality: Some counties lack sufficient employment
- States may exempt individuals in high unemployment areas
- Definition varies: County unemployment rate thresholds (typically 10%+)
- Temporary vs. permanent exemptions based on economic conditions
- Creates geographic equity question: Why should coverage depend on local labor market?

**The Jobs Reality Problem**: This exemption reveals fundamental tension in reciprocity framework. If work requirements are about mutual obligation (society provides coverage, you provide work), what happens when society cannot provide work opportunities? High unemployment exemptions acknowledge that:
- Not everyone who wants to work can find employment
- Local economic conditions beyond individual control affect compliance
- Punishing people for unemployment they didn't cause undermines reciprocity logic
- Rural and economically depressed areas may have permanently insufficient job markets

**Systems Implication**: High unemployment exemptions create perverse incentive—counties benefit from maintaining high unemployment to protect residents' healthcare access. Also creates administrative complexity: tracking unemployment rates, determining thresholds, processing exemptions, managing transitions as rates fluctuate.

**Penalties:**
- Termination (Arkansas 2018): Clear consequences, harsh impact
- Suspension (Arkansas 2025 proposal): Softer language, same practical effect
- Progressive (some proposals): Warnings before penalties
- Continuous (some proposals): No penalties, just reporting requirements

Each choice creates different incentive structures, which produce different system dynamics, which generate different emergent patterns.

## Emergent Patterns: What Systems Create

Complex systems produce patterns that aren't designed by anyone but emerge from interactions between components. Work requirements generate at least five predictable emergent patterns:

### Pattern 1: The Documentation Arms Race

**System Dynamic:**
1. States demand documentation to prevent fraud
2. Community organizations develop templates and services to help compliance
3. States tighten standards in response to "gaming"
4. CBOs develop more sophisticated workarounds
5. Verification costs escalate for everyone
6. Fraud prevention doesn't measurably improve

**Result:** Administrative burden increases without achieving security goals. The system optimizes for paperwork, not outcomes.

**State Variation:** Arkansas required specific documentation formats; Georgia's system rejected valid documents for technical reasons. Each iteration adds complexity.

### Pattern 2: The Cream-Skimming Cascade

**System Dynamic:**
1. Employers most likely to help with verification: Large businesses with HR systems
2. These employers already offer better wages and benefits
3. Workers in precarious employment (gig economy, small business, informal sector) struggle with documentation
4. Work requirements inadvertently advantage already-advantaged workers
5. Within Medicaid expansion population, inequality increases

**Result:** The policy designed to promote work makes it harder for people in most precarious jobs to maintain coverage.

**State Variation:** States with stronger gig economies (California, Texas) will see this pattern amplified. States with more traditional employment (manufacturing-heavy states) may see less distortion.

### Pattern 3: The Exemption Bottleneck

**System Dynamic:**
1. Medical exemptions require physician documentation
2. Safety-net clinics serving Medicaid populations become overwhelmed
3. Wait times increase for exemption appointments
4. People lose coverage while waiting for exemption paperwork
5. Emergency departments become de facto exemption processing sites
6. Healthcare system dysfunction drives coverage loss

**Result:** The system creates coverage loss not from lack of genuine exemption eligibility, but from inability to document it.

**State Variation:** States with robust safety-net infrastructure (Massachusetts, Minnesota) may handle this better than states with threadbare systems (Mississippi, Alabama). But volume overwhelms even well-resourced systems.

### Pattern 4: The Navigation Industrial Complex

**System Dynamic:**
1. States recognize people need help navigating complexity
2. Government contracts fund CBOs to provide navigation
3. Navigation capacity concentrates in urban areas and well-resourced communities
4. Rural and under-resourced areas develop navigation deserts
5. People most isolated from support systems face highest barriers
6. Geographic inequality in effective access despite identical state policies

**Result:** Formal policy equality masks practical access inequality.

**State Variation:** Georgia spent >$50M on verification systems but minimal amounts on navigation support. Other states might balance differently, but resource constraints mean rural areas always lag.

### Pattern 5: The Churn Economy

**System Dynamic:**
1. Insurers invest in care coordination for high-need members
2. Work requirements create enrollment volatility
3. ROI for intensive care management decreases
4. Insurers rationally shift resources toward stable populations
5. Churning members get lower-quality care even while enrolled
6. Work requirements undermine value-based care models

**Result:** Policy designed to improve outcomes by promoting work actually degrades care quality.

**State Variation:** States with mature managed care markets (Arizona, Tennessee) feel this more acutely than states with newer programs. But the dynamic affects all states with managed care.

## Feedback Loops: When Solutions Become Problems

Systems thinking identifies feedback loops—where effects circle back to influence their causes. Work requirements create several self-reinforcing cycles:

### The Health-Work Spiral (Negative Feedback)

**The Loop:**
Coverage loss → health deterioration → reduced work capacity → continued non-compliance → worse health → greater work barriers

**Why It Persists:**
Each intervention point (employer flexibility, provider care, CBO navigation) is insufficient alone. Breaking the cycle requires simultaneous intervention at multiple points—but no single stakeholder has capacity or authority.

**State Variation:**
- States with comprehensive support services (hypothetical—none exist yet) might break this cycle
- States with work requirements but no support services (Georgia current) create the strongest negative spirals
- States that exempt people with health conditions before the spiral starts (better design) prevent it

### The Documentation Burden Loop (Negative Feedback)

**The Loop:**
Complex verification → people miss deadlines → states add more reminders and requirements → system becomes more complex → more people miss deadlines → states add penalties → documentation becomes even more critical

**Why It Persists:**
Each "solution" (more reminders, stricter penalties, additional requirements) amplifies underlying complexity. The system fights its own dysfunction by doing more of what created the problem.

**State Variation:**
- Arkansas 2018 exemplified this—adding phone reporting after online-only failed, but by then system complexity was overwhelming
- Ohio's proposal to eliminate reporting altogether attempts to escape this loop by removing the mechanism creating it
- Most states will likely land in the middle: some automation, some manual reporting, persistent complexity

### The Exemption Definition Dilemma (Either Direction)

**The Loop (Negative):**
Narrow exemptions → vulnerable people lose coverage → advocacy pressure → broader exemptions → more people qualify → "program integrity" concerns → narrower exemptions

**The Loop (Positive):**
Broad exemptions → most people qualify → few subject to requirements → work requirements become symbolic → political support increases (less harm) OR decreases (doesn't achieve goals)

**Why Either Persists:**
Exemption breadth involves fundamental values tensions—no "correct" answer exists, only trade-offs.

**State Variation:**
- Georgia chose narrow exemptions (no caregiver exemption) → maximum coverage loss
- Most proposals include broad exemptions (medical, caregiver, student, age) → fewer affected but more complex navigation
- Equilibrium point differs by state political culture

### The Stakeholder Coordination Challenge (Direction Uncertain)

**Positive Direction:**
Good coordination → seamless processes → increased compliance → fewer losses → more resources available for support → better coordination

**Negative Direction:**
Poor coordination → contradictory demands → frustrated members → coverage loss → system appears broken → less investment in coordination → worse coordination

**Tipping Point:**
Early coordination investment determines which direction the system takes. Once established, the pattern reinforces itself.

**State Variation:**
- States with history of multi-stakeholder collaboration (Minnesota, Washington) more likely to achieve positive loop
- States with fragmented systems and adversarial relationships (varies) more likely to get negative loop
- Initial federal implementation funding critical for determining direction

## The Measurement Problem: What We Track vs. What Matters

Systems create what you measure. But work requirements face fundamental measurement challenges:

### What Are We Actually Measuring?

**Official Metric:** Work requirement compliance rates

**Actual Phenomenon:** A complex mix of:
- Genuine work capacity
- Documentation ability
- System navigation skills
- Stakeholder support quality
- Administrative burden tolerance
- Life stability
- Social capital
- Digital literacy
- Language proficiency
- Transportation access
- Childcare availability

**Policy Assumption:** First metric proxies for second phenomenon

**Reality:** Weak correlation. Arkansas showed high non-compliance among people who were working or exempt—they failed the documentation test, not the work test.

**State Variation:**
- States that recognize this disconnect (Ohio's data matching) try to measure actual phenomenon directly
- States that don't (Arkansas 2018, Georgia current) measure compliance with processes, not underlying reality
- Measurement choice shapes system evolution

### Optimization Paradoxes

**Optimize for Compliance Rates:**
States simplify verification → fraud concerns increase → verification tightens → compliance rates fall → pressure to simplify → cycle repeats

**Optimize for Fraud Prevention:**
Documentation requirements increase → legitimate workers can't comply → coverage losses rise → political pressure builds → requirements loosen → fraud concerns return

**Optimize for Stakeholder Efficiency:**
Automation increases → edge cases poorly handled → exemption requests surge → human processing becomes bottleneck → system slows → automation increases to compensate

**State Variation:**
- Conservative states may optimize for fraud prevention (accepting coverage loss as proof of policy working)
- Liberal states may optimize for compliance rates (accepting some fraud risk to maintain coverage)
- Most states will oscillate between priorities as political winds shift

## Leverage Points: Where Small Changes Create Big Impacts

Systems theory identifies leverage points—places where relatively small interventions produce disproportionate results. Not all interventions are equal.

### High-Leverage Interventions

**1. Presumptive Eligibility During Verification**
Maintain coverage while documentation is processed. Breaks the health-work spiral by preventing coverage loss during administrative delays.

**State Variation:**
- States could implement this without federal permission (using existing presumptive eligibility authority)
- Cost: Minimal (short-term coverage during processing)
- Impact: Major (breaks cascade of coverage loss → health deterioration)
- Political feasibility: Low (appears to weaken requirements)

**2. Universal Payroll System Integration**
Automatic verification for W-2 workers (60%+ of labor force). Removes burden for majority while concentrating resources on complex cases.

**State Variation:**
- Requires cooperation from payroll processors (ADP, Paychex, Gusto)
- Technical complexity: High but solvable
- Privacy concerns: Significant but manageable
- Impact: Removes 60% of reporting burden
- Political feasibility: Medium (sounds efficient)

**3. Exemption Default for Primary Care Attestation**
Simple provider checkbox creates exemption without extensive documentation. Eliminates bottleneck while leveraging existing clinical relationships.

**State Variation:**
- Requires provider participation (not guaranteed)
- Fraud risk: Moderate (providers might over-exempt)
- Administrative simplicity: High
- Impact: Major reduction in exemption burden
- Political feasibility: Medium (concerns about provider "gaming")

**4. Regional Coordination Hubs**
Multi-stakeholder collaboratives sharing information and aligning processes. Reduces system complexity by creating coordination infrastructure.

**State Variation:**
- States with existing regional structures (Area Agencies on Aging, regional planning commissions) have head start
- Funding: Medicaid admin dollars, state general funds
- Impact: Enables positive stakeholder coordination feedback loop
- Political feasibility: High (appeals to efficiency)

**5. Continuous Eligibility During Transitions**
Coverage maintained for 3 months during job changes, moves, life disruptions. Builds in resilience against system fragility.

**State Variation:**
- Federal authority unclear (may require waiver)
- Cost: Moderate (short-term coverage during transitions)
- Impact: Major (prevents cascade failures)
- Political feasibility: Low (appears to weaken requirements)

### Low-Leverage Interventions

**1. Education Campaigns**
Lots of effort, little system change. System is too complex for education alone to solve. Arkansas learned this—people understood requirements but couldn't navigate processes.

**2. Call Centers Without Process Changes**
Answering questions doesn't reduce underlying burden. Georgia's call center couldn't fix website glitches or simplify documentation requirements.

**3. Penalties for Non-Compliance**
Enforcement doesn't address capacity barriers. Arkansas showed people weren't avoiding work—they couldn't navigate documentation.

**4. One-Off Stakeholder Partnerships**
Without coordination infrastructure, effects don't spread. Individual employer partnerships don't scale to system level.

## State Incentives: Why States Make Different Choices

States aren't neutral implementers—they have their own incentives that shape policy choices:

### Fiscal Incentives

**Medicaid Expansion States:**
- Already pay enhanced federal match (90%) for expansion population
- Work requirements risk losing federal match if CMS determines non-compliance with Medicaid objectives
- Fiscal incentive: Keep people enrolled to maintain federal funding
- But: Face pressure to reduce state spending on administrative costs

**Non-Expansion States:**
- Can use work requirements to expand coverage minimally (Georgia model)
- Avoid full expansion costs while claiming to help some people
- Fiscal incentive: Minimize enrollment to minimize state spending
- But: Leave more people uninsured, face provider pressure for expansion

**State Variation:**
- Expansion states (most blue states, some red) will implement less stringent requirements to avoid federal disallowance
- Non-expansion states (remaining red states) may use work requirements as partial expansion alternative
- Each creates different system dynamics

### Political Incentives

**States with Work Requirement Support:**
- Political reward for implementing requirements regardless of outcomes
- Can point to policy existence as success, minimize coverage loss data
- Incentive: Design stringent requirements (signals commitment) but poor tracking (avoids bad press)

**States with Work Requirement Opposition:**
- Political pressure to minimize harm while complying with federal mandate
- Need to document failures for future advocacy
- Incentive: Design generous exemptions and robust support services while documenting every implementation problem

**State Variation:**
- Red states may optimize for symbolic policy strength
- Blue states may optimize for minimizing harm
- Purple states face competing pressures, likely resulting in muddled middle

### Administrative Capacity Incentives

**High-Capacity States:**
- Can build sophisticated systems (data matching, integrated platforms)
- Risk: Over-engineering creates new complexity
- Incentive: Demonstrate technical competence through complex solutions

**Low-Capacity States:**
- Struggle to build basic verification systems
- Risk: System failures undermine policy entirely
- Incentive: Contract out to vendors (expensive) or delay implementation

**State Variation:**
- High-capacity states (California, New York, Massachusetts) will build complex systems that might work
- Low-capacity states (Mississippi, Arkansas, West Virginia) will struggle with basics
- This capacity variation becomes outcome variation regardless of policy design

### Vendor Incentives

**Technology Vendors:**
- Sell verification systems to states
- Financial incentive: Complex requirements = more expensive systems
- Influence: Vendors shape what's "technically feasible"
- Result: Systems optimized for vendor profit, not user experience

**State Variation:**
- States using existing vendors (Deloitte in Georgia) inherit vendor incentives
- States building in-house have different incentives but capacity constraints
- Vendor market concentration means few alternatives

## Adaptation: Toward What Future?

Complex systems adapt. The question is: **Toward what?**

### Possible Adaptation Pathways

**Path 1: Greater Efficiency**
- Streamlined verification through technology
- Better data matching reducing reporting burden
- Integrated employment support services
- Mature stakeholder coordination
- **Likelihood:** Low—requires sustained investment and coordination rarely achieved

**Path 2: Greater Inequality**
- Two-tier system: Sophisticated navigators succeed, isolated populations fail
- Urban-rural divide deepens
- Cream-skimming accelerates
- System works for some, fails for others
- **Likelihood:** High—emerges naturally without intervention

**Path 3: Greater Surveillance**
- Normalized tracking of daily activities
- Continuous government monitoring
- Inter-agency data sharing expands
- Privacy norms erode
- **Likelihood:** Medium—follows from automation logic

**Path 4: Greater Community Capacity**
- Strengthened local institutions
- Mutual aid networks develop
- Community navigators become profession
- Social capital increases
- **Likelihood:** Low—requires intentional investment against market incentives

**Path 5: Wholesale Rejection**
- System dysfunction so severe it drives political reversal
- Courts strike down requirements
- States abandon implementation
- Return to coverage without conditions
- **Likelihood:** Medium—depends on degree of visible harm

**Most Likely:** Combination of 2, 3, and elements of 5. The system will sort people into winners (good jobs, documentation capacity) and losers (precarious work, limited capacity), while expanding surveillance and generating periodic political crises that produce incremental reforms without fundamental change.

## Implications for Implementation

Systems perspective suggests several principles:

**1. Design for Adaptation, Not Perfection**
Systems will evolve. Build in learning mechanisms and feedback loops rather than rigid rules. States should plan for revision cycles.

**2. Anticipate Emergence**
Unintended consequences aren't accidents—they're predictable system properties. Design with emergent patterns in mind.

**3. Invest in Connective Tissue**
Coordination infrastructure may matter more than any single stakeholder capacity. Regional hubs and data-sharing agreements enable positive feedback loops.

**4. Monitor Leading Indicators**
System stress shows up before collapse. Watch stakeholder burden, appeals rates, geographic variation, and exemption bottlenecks.

**5. Preserve Redundancy**
Multiple pathways to compliance aren't inefficient—they're system resilience. Single points of failure create catastrophic risk.

**6. Plan for Cascade Failures**
Tight coupling means failures spread. Build in buffers (presumptive eligibility, grace periods) and circuit breakers (automatic exemptions during system failures).

**7. Match Measurement to Goals**
If the goal is increasing employment, measure employment—not compliance with reporting processes. Arkansas measured the wrong thing and got the wrong outcome.

**8. Recognize State Variation as Feature, Not Bug**
Different states will generate different emergent patterns. This isn't implementation failure—it's system response to different contexts. Learn from variation rather than seeking uniformity.

## Conclusion: Systems Create Their Own Reality

Work requirements aren't simply policies that succeed or fail based on implementation quality. They're interventions in complex adaptive systems that will evolve in ways no one fully controls or predicts.

Arkansas and Georgia taught us that well-designed policies with appropriate exemptions and reasonable requirements can still produce mass coverage loss, no employment gains, and administrative dysfunction. The problem isn't that they implemented poorly—it's that complex systems generate emergent properties that overwhelm design intentions.

As OBBBA's work requirements roll out across states, we'll witness 50 natural experiments in system dynamics. Some states will achieve greater efficiency through automation. Others will create deeper inequality through uneven support systems. Most will experience some combination of surveillance expansion, community adaptation, and periodic crises that force evolution.

The distributed implementation model creates the possibility of learning from variation—but only if we look beyond individual state "successes" and "failures" to understand the underlying system dynamics that generate outcomes.

The coming years will reveal whether we can build work requirement systems that promote dignity and opportunity, or whether we'll discover that certain policy goals are fundamentally incompatible with the complex realities of modern labor markets, healthcare needs, and human capacity.

That revelation itself may be the most important outcome of this massive natural experiment in social policy.
