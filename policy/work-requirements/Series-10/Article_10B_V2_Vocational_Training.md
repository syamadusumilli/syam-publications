# Article 10B: Vocational Training and Workforce Development

*Non-Degree Pathways to Compliance and Employment*

Not everyone pursuing education as a work requirement compliance pathway will enroll in traditional higher education. Vocational training programs, apprenticeships, and workforce development initiatives offer alternative routes that often provide faster pathways to employment while satisfying compliance obligations. These non-degree programs operate under different regulatory frameworks, serve somewhat different populations, and have existing relationships with employment systems that traditional higher education often lacks.

The workforce development system represents a particularly important but often overlooked resource. Programs funded through the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act already track participant outcomes, coordinate with employers, and provide supportive services addressing barriers to employment. Adding Medicaid work requirement verification to existing WIOA infrastructure creates integration opportunities, though the administrative burden on already-stretched workforce boards warrants careful consideration.

## The WIOA Infrastructure

The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act funds a nationwide network of American Job Centers, workforce development boards, and training programs serving job seekers and employers. WIOA programs already serve populations substantially overlapping with Medicaid expansion adults: individuals with barriers to employment, those lacking credentials, people transitioning from public assistance, and workers displaced by economic change. The infrastructure exists; the question is how it adapts to work requirement compliance functions.

WIOA programs offer several advantages for work requirement compliance. They already track participant hours in training and employment activities. They maintain relationships with employers who provide work-based learning and job placements. They coordinate supportive services addressing transportation, childcare, and other barriers. They have experience serving populations facing multiple simultaneous challenges. This existing capacity could be leveraged for Medicaid compliance with appropriate data sharing and coordination.

The **data integration opportunity** is significant. WIOA programs already report participant activity to state workforce agencies using standardized data systems. Connecting these systems to state Medicaid verification portals could automate compliance documentation for participants in workforce development programs. Someone enrolled in a WIOA-funded training program would have their hours automatically reported to Medicaid agencies without requiring separate documentation efforts.

But workforce development boards are already stretched thin. Federal WIOA funding has remained relatively flat while service demands have increased. Adding Medicaid verification to workforce board responsibilities without corresponding resources risks degrading existing services. States implementing integrated verification should provide additional administrative funding, technical assistance for system integration, and staffing support for expanded functions. The efficiency gains from integration should not become cost-shifting that undermines workforce development capacity.

## Registered Apprenticeships

Registered apprenticeships represent perhaps the ideal work requirement compliance pathway. They combine paid employment with structured learning, provide industry-recognized credentials upon completion, and offer clear pathways to family-sustaining wages. Someone enrolled in a registered apprenticeship accumulates work hours through employment and could potentially claim additional hours for related technical instruction. Full compliance becomes virtually automatic.

The verification advantage is substantial. Registered apprenticeship programs maintain detailed records of participant hours in both work and learning components. Program sponsors have established relationships with state apprenticeship agencies and industry partners. Documentation infrastructure already exists; extending it to Medicaid verification requires modest adaptation rather than new system development. States should credential registered apprenticeship programs as authorized verification submitters with streamlined approval processes recognizing their existing documentation capacity.

The challenge is access. Registered apprenticeship slots are limited and competitive. Construction trades, manufacturing, healthcare, and information technology offer the most apprenticeship opportunities, but combined capacity serves only a fraction of the workforce seeking entry to these fields. Expansion adults competing for limited apprenticeship slots face significant barriers including prerequisite requirements, application processes, and employer selection preferences that may disadvantage candidates with limited work history or gaps in employment.

Pre-apprenticeship programs offer an intermediate pathway. These programs prepare participants for apprenticeship entry through foundational skill development, workplace readiness training, and exposure to apprenticeable occupations. States should count pre-apprenticeship participation as qualifying activity, recognizing that the pathway to apprenticeship itself represents valuable human capital development. Someone in a pre-apprenticeship program is building toward sustainable employment even if they haven't yet secured an apprenticeship slot.

## Trade Schools and the Quality Question

Private vocational schools present a more complicated landscape. Some trade schools provide excellent training producing graduates with marketable skills and strong employment outcomes. Others extract federal financial aid while providing credentials with minimal labor market value. Work requirements create new markets for institutions optimized for compliance rather than outcomes, raising concerns about protecting expansion adults from predatory programs.

The **predatory institution risk** deserves serious attention. For-profit colleges have historically targeted low-income populations, enrolled students in programs with poor completion rates and weak employment outcomes, and left graduates with debt but without valuable credentials. Work requirements create new incentives for similar predation. An institution could market itself as providing work requirement compliance without delivering genuine skill development or employment preparation.

States need frameworks distinguishing legitimate vocational programs from credential mills. Accreditation provides one filter, but accreditation standards vary and some accrediting bodies have certified problematic institutions. Employment outcomes offer another metric, but outcomes data is often unavailable or unreliable. Program completion rates, student loan default rates, and graduate earnings data could inform eligibility determinations, but no single metric captures program quality comprehensively.

The policy tension involves access versus protection. Restrictive eligibility criteria protect expansion adults from predatory programs but limit educational options, potentially concentrating students in oversubscribed community college programs. Permissive criteria maximize access but expose vulnerable populations to institutions that will happily enroll them, document their compliance hours, and provide minimal educational value. States must balance these competing concerns without perfect information about program quality.

## The Accreditation Maze

States designing work requirement rules must decide which institutions qualify as legitimate educational activity providers. The simplest approach limits eligibility to institutions with regional accreditation recognized by the Department of Education. This captures community colleges, state universities, and most established private institutions while excluding unaccredited programs and some nationally accredited proprietary schools.

But this approach excludes legitimate vocational programs operating outside traditional accreditation frameworks. A welding certification program sponsored by a local manufacturing consortium might provide excellent training and guaranteed employment without holding accreditation. An industry-specific bootcamp producing job-ready graduates in twelve weeks may lack the infrastructure for accreditation while delivering strong outcomes. Excluding these programs limits access to training that genuinely serves expansion adult interests.

Alternative approaches include state approval processes for non-accredited programs, outcomes-based eligibility requiring demonstrated employment rates, industry certification recognition allowing programs producing industry-credentialed graduates regardless of institutional accreditation, and employer partnership criteria counting programs with documented employer commitments for graduate hiring. Each approach involves administrative complexity and imperfect quality signals.

## Stackable Credentials and Modular Training

The traditional model of education as multi-year, full-time enrollment fits poorly with expansion adult life circumstances. Many cannot commit to two-year programs while managing employment, family responsibilities, and unstable housing. Stackable credentials offering shorter-term achievements that build toward longer-term qualifications provide flexibility that traditional programs lack.

A **stackable credential pathway** might begin with a six-week certified nursing assistant program. Upon completion, the graduate can work while pursuing additional certifications. A phlebotomy certificate adds capability and earning potential. Licensed practical nurse training builds further. Eventually, the pathway reaches registered nurse licensure through accumulated credentials rather than continuous enrollment. Each step provides both labor market value and work requirement compliance while building toward greater opportunity.

Work requirement policies should explicitly accommodate stackable credential models. Gaps between credential program enrollments should not trigger non-compliance if students are employed using previously earned credentials while preparing for next steps. Combined activity counting education hours during enrollment periods and work hours during employment periods should be straightforward to document and verify. The pathway model requires flexibility that rigid monthly compliance frameworks may not naturally provide.

Documentation complexity increases with modular approaches. Someone pursuing stackable credentials might be enrolled in a certificate program in January, working full-time in February and March, enrolled in a different program in April, and combining part-time work with part-time enrollment in May. Each month requires different verification from different sources. States designing verification systems should anticipate this complexity rather than assuming stable enrollment patterns throughout compliance periods.

## Industry-Specific Training Programs

Several industries have developed training programs specifically designed for workforce entry with minimal prerequisites. Healthcare, information technology, manufacturing, and skilled trades all offer programs that can take someone with limited work history and produce an employable candidate in weeks to months rather than years. These industry-specific programs often provide strong employment outcomes for completers while operating outside traditional higher education frameworks.

Healthcare offers perhaps the most accessible entry points. Certified nursing assistant training typically requires four to twelve weeks. Home health aide certification can be completed in days to weeks. Medical assistant programs run six to twelve months. These credentials provide immediate employment opportunities in a sector with persistent labor shortages. For expansion adults, healthcare training offers a compliance pathway that also addresses the sector's workforce needs.

Information technology bootcamps present a different model. Intensive programs lasting eight to sixteen weeks claim to produce job-ready developers, data analysts, or cybersecurity professionals. Outcomes vary dramatically by program, with some placing graduates in well-paying positions and others producing graduates who struggle to find employment. The bootcamp model's rapid proliferation makes quality assessment challenging, but strong programs genuinely create pathways to middle-class employment.

Manufacturing and construction training programs often involve employer partnerships that provide work-based learning alongside classroom instruction. An expansion adult enrolled in a manufacturing training program might spend mornings in technical instruction and afternoons on the factory floor. Both components should count toward work requirements, and the employer partner provides verification for both educational and work activities. This integration simplifies compliance while building genuine skills.

## The Workforce Board Coordination Challenge

State and local workforce development boards coordinate training programs, connect job seekers with employers, and manage federal workforce funding. They represent natural coordination points for integrating education, employment, and Medicaid compliance. But workforce boards vary enormously in capacity, sophistication, and geographic reach. Some operate comprehensive systems serving large metropolitan areas; others struggle to serve rural regions with minimal staff and resources.

The coordination potential is significant. A workforce board aware of members' Medicaid status could proactively connect them with training programs providing compliance hours while building employable skills. Case managers could help participants understand how different program choices affect both employment prospects and healthcare coverage. Data systems tracking program enrollment could automatically generate Medicaid verification, eliminating duplicate documentation burdens.

Realizing this potential requires investment. Workforce board staff need training on Medicaid eligibility and work requirements. Data systems need modification to capture and share compliance-relevant information. Coordination protocols need development to define how workforce boards interact with state Medicaid agencies and MCOs. None of this happens automatically; it requires deliberate policy development and resource allocation.

The **American Job Center network** offers physical infrastructure for co-located services. Job Centers already provide one-stop access to employment services, training programs, and support resources. Adding Medicaid navigation capacity, whether through staff training or co-location with Medicaid navigators, creates comprehensive service hubs serving expansion adults across multiple needs. Someone visiting an American Job Center for job search assistance could simultaneously receive help maintaining Medicaid coverage while pursuing employment.

## Employer-Sponsored Training

Employers increasingly provide training for new hires who lack traditional credentials. Rather than requiring applicants to arrive job-ready, employers invest in developing workers who demonstrate aptitude and commitment. This employer-sponsored training creates work requirement compliance pathways that combine employment with skill development, often without requiring formal enrollment in educational institutions.

Large employers in healthcare, retail, logistics, and manufacturing have developed internal training programs that can transform entry-level hires into skilled workers. Amazon's Career Choice program funds education for warehouse workers. Walmart's Live Better U provides tuition assistance. Healthcare systems operate nursing schools and medical assistant training programs. These employer investments serve business needs while creating educational opportunity for workers including expansion adults.

Work requirement policies should count employer-sponsored training as qualifying educational activity. Time spent in employer-provided training, even if conducted on-site during work hours, represents human capital development comparable to classroom instruction at external institutions. Verification should be straightforward since employers can document both employment hours and training participation through unified systems. The challenge is ensuring that employer-reported training reflects genuine educational content rather than relabeling of routine work activities.

On-the-job training presents particular complexity. Learning that happens through work experience, mentorship, and progressive responsibility represents genuine skill development but lacks the structure and documentation of formal training programs. States must decide whether to count informal on-the-job learning as educational activity, require structured training curricula for educational credit, or count all work hours uniformly regardless of learning content. Each approach involves tradeoffs between simplicity and accuracy in crediting human capital development.

## Verification Infrastructure for Non-Traditional Programs

Traditional higher education institutions have established enrollment verification infrastructure developed over decades of financial aid administration. Non-traditional vocational programs often lack equivalent systems. A community college can generate an enrollment verification letter in minutes using standardized processes. A small trade school may have no documented verification procedure at all.

States should provide verification infrastructure support for non-traditional programs. Standardized verification templates, online submission portals, and technical assistance for smaller programs could help vocational training providers meet Medicaid documentation requirements without building custom systems. State-provided infrastructure lowers barriers to participation while maintaining verification quality standards.

Program credentialing processes should accommodate provider diversity. Large workforce development programs with sophisticated data systems might achieve credentialing through demonstrated technical capacity for automated reporting. Small programs might qualify through commitment to manual verification using state-provided templates. The goal is enabling legitimate programs to participate regardless of administrative sophistication while maintaining accountability for verification accuracy.

Audit and oversight mechanisms become particularly important for non-traditional providers. Without the accountability structures surrounding accredited institutions, verification of vocational program claims requires independent confirmation. Random audits verifying that reported training actually occurred, that participants genuinely attended, and that program content matches descriptions submitted during credentialing help ensure verification integrity without creating prohibitive administrative requirements.

## Building Pathways That Work

Vocational training and workforce development programs offer expansion adults pathways to compliance that can also transform their economic prospects. The best programs combine skill development with employment connections, producing graduates who maintain healthcare coverage while building careers rather than just satisfying hourly requirements. Realizing this potential requires thoughtful policy design distinguishing quality programs from predatory ones, integration between workforce and Medicaid systems, and investment in verification infrastructure accommodating program diversity.

The workforce development system already serves populations facing barriers to employment. Medicaid work requirements create both burden and opportunity for this system. The burden involves new administrative functions and verification responsibilities without guaranteed additional resources. The opportunity involves strengthened rationale for workforce investment and potential new funding streams as Medicaid agencies recognize workforce development as essential compliance infrastructure.

States designing work requirement policies should view workforce development and vocational training as essential infrastructure rather than peripheral alternatives to traditional employment. For many expansion adults, training programs provide the only realistic pathway to sustainable compliance through employment that pays enough to eventually eliminate Medicaid eligibility entirely. This represents the policy goal: not perpetual compliance management, but human capital development enabling economic mobility beyond the need for public healthcare coverage.
