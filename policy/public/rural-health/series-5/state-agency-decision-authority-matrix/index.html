  "articleBody": "This technical document provides a comprehensive reference documenting who holds decision authority for RHTP implementation across all 50 states. The document distinguishes between formal authority (what organizational charts show) and actual authority (who makes decisions in practice), revealing the authority gaps that shape implementation outcomes.\nThis is not merely a directory. It organizes data to reveal patterns of authority concentration, fragmentation, and gap that predict implementation success or struggle. Users should consult this document when seeking to understand state-specific governance dynamics, identify comparable states for cross-state learning, or assess where formal accountability diverges from actual implementation control.\nMethodology Data Sources Primary sources include state RHTP applications, CMS cooperative agreement documentation, state organizational charts, and Governor executive orders. Secondary sources include NASHP policy analyses, state news coverage, and prior federal program evaluations. Gap assessments derive from analysis of decision patterns, revision histories, and stakeholder interviews where available.\nAuthority Gap Classification Classification Definition Indicators Low Lead agency controls resources and decisions Fast implementation timelines, minimal revision to proposals, lead agency spokesperson dominance Moderate Lead agency decides within constraints set by others Required coordination with Medicaid/Governor, moderate revision patterns, shared public representation High Lead agency implements decisions made elsewhere Extensive Governor review, Medicaid override on key decisions, long approval timelines Very High Lead agency lacks meaningful decision authority Nominal lead with decisions made by Governor’s office or other agencies, symbolic role Limitations Authority gaps are difficult to observe directly. Assessments reflect available evidence but cannot capture all informal dynamics, personal relationships, or political contexts that shape actual decision-making. Assessments should be treated as informed estimates subject to revision as implementation proceeds and additional evidence emerges.\nSection 1: Lead Agency Identification Complete State Listing State Lead Agency Agency Type FY2026 Award Rural Pop.

<p>This technical document provides a <strong>comprehensive reference</strong> documenting who holds decision authority for RHTP implementation across all 50 states. The document distinguishes between formal authority (what organizational charts show) and actual authority (who makes decisions in practice), revealing the authority gaps that shape implementation outcomes.</p>
<p>This is not merely a directory. It organizes data to reveal <strong>patterns of authority concentration, fragmentation, and gap</strong> that predict implementation success or struggle. Users should consult this document when seeking to understand state-specific governance dynamics, identify comparable states for cross-state learning, or assess where formal accountability diverges from actual implementation control.</p>

<h3 id="data-sources">Data Sources<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#data-sources">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Primary sources</strong> include state RHTP applications, CMS cooperative agreement documentation, state organizational charts, and Governor executive orders. <strong>Secondary sources</strong> include NASHP policy analyses, state news coverage, and prior federal program evaluations. <strong>Gap assessments</strong> derive from analysis of decision patterns, revision histories, and stakeholder interviews where available.</p>

<h3 id="limitations">Limitations<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#limitations">#</a></h3>
<p>Authority gaps are difficult to observe directly. Assessments reflect available evidence but cannot capture all informal dynamics, personal relationships, or political contexts that shape actual decision-making. Assessments should be treated as <strong>informed estimates subject to revision</strong> as implementation proceeds and additional evidence emerges.</p>
