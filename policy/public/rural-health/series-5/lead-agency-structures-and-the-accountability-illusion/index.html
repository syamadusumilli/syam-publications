  "articleBody": "Every state RHTP application names a lead agency. CMS requires it. Governors designate it. Organizational charts display it. The designation creates formal accountability: one entity responsible for $2 billion to $500 million in federal investment, answerable for outcomes affecting millions of rural residents.\nThe accountability is often an illusion. Organizational charts show who should decide. Reality reveals who actually decides. These frequently diverge, and the gap between formal and actual authority shapes implementation more than any strategic plan.\nSeries 5 examines state agencies as RHTP implementers. This first article establishes the foundation: how lead agency structures create accountability theater while actual decision-making authority flows through channels the formal structure obscures. Understanding this gap matters because CMS holds lead agencies accountable for outcomes they sometimes cannot control, while actual decision-makers face no federal oversight.\nThe tension between formal accountability and actual authority is not a flaw to be corrected. It reflects the inherent messiness of cooperative federalism, where federal funds flow through state bureaucracies shaped by political incentives, historical organizational choices, and leadership personalities that no NOFO can standardize.\nThe Federal Framework CMS Requirements The RHTP Notice of Funding Opportunity mandates Governor designation of a single lead agency to submit applications and manage implementation. This single-agency accountability model assumes clear lines of authority: one entity responsible, one entity accountable, one entity answerable to CMS for program performance.\nLead agency responsibilities under federal requirements include:\nCooperative agreement execution and compliance Subaward administration and oversight Performance monitoring and reporting Financial management and audit response Stakeholder coordination documentation Annual progress reports and budget narratives CMS cannot split accountability across multiple state entities. The agency learned from prior programs that shared responsibility produces diffuse accountability where no one answers for failures. RHTP’s design demands someone be responsible.\nWhat Federal Requirements Miss The federal framework assumes the lead agency designated on paper controls the resources and decisions required to perform its functions. This assumption frequently fails in practice.\nGovernors may designate a Department of Health as lead agency while reserving substantive decisions for the Governor’s office. State Medicaid agencies may control funding flows regardless of which agency holds the cooperative agreement. Legislative budget processes may constrain lead agency discretion. Procurement rules administered by separate agencies may delay implementation regardless of lead agency urgency.\nCMS designed RHTP accountability for an organizational clarity that state government rarely provides. The result is a formal accountability structure overlaid on actual authority patterns it cannot see or influence.\nThe Consultation Requirement Applications must document consultation with specified stakeholders regardless of lead agency designation: state Medicaid agencies, State Offices of Rural Health, tribal affairs offices, providers, and communities. This requirement acknowledges that lead agencies lack complete authority and must coordinate with entities holding complementary powers.\nBut consultation is not authority. A Department of Health can document extensive Medicaid agency consultation while that agency makes implementation decisions the lead agency cannot override. The consultation requirement creates documentation without ensuring coordination.\nLead Agency Designation Patterns Across 50 states, lead agency designations cluster into distinct patterns with different implications for the relationship between formal accountability and actual authority.\nLead Agency Type Approximate States Typical Authority Pattern Common Authority Gap State Department of Health 24 Program administration, provider relations Moderate to High: Medicaid controls payment, Governor controls priorities Medicaid/HHS Agency 14 Payment systems, eligibility, care coordination Low to Moderate: Authority aligns with accountability Combined Health and Human Services 7 Integrated authority across health functions Low: Consolidated structure reduces gap Office of Rural Health 3 Rural expertise, Flex Program experience Very High: Expertise without budget or decision authority Other Configurations 2 Variable Variable Department of Health Leadership The most common designation places State Departments of Health in the lead agency role. This choice reflects DOH traditional responsibility for population health programs, existing rural health office infrastructure, and established relationships with rural providers through Flex Program administration.\nDOH leadership works well when the department controls sufficient resources and decision authority. It fails when Medicaid agencies control payment systems that determine provider viability, when Governor’s offices override strategic decisions, or when DOH lacks implementation capacity that more operational agencies possess.\nThe DOH gap pattern emerges in states where health policy authority has migrated to Medicaid over decades while formal DOH responsibility remained. Medicaid expansion, managed care transitions, and payment reform initiatives accumulated at Medicaid agencies while DOH retained population health programs with smaller budgets and less policy impact. DOH designation for RHTP places accountability where authority once resided but has since departed.\nMedicaid Agency Leadership States where Medicaid agencies lead RHTP show smaller authority gaps. This pattern appears in Arizona (AHCCCS), Rhode Island (EOHHS), Connecticut (DSS), and Missouri (DSS), where agencies responsible for RHTP hold cooperative agreements.\nThe alignment logic is straightforward. Medicaid agencies control the payment systems that determine whether rural healthcare remains viable. They manage the eligibility systems that determine coverage. They negotiate with managed care organizations that increasingly dominate rural markets. Placing RHTP authority at Medicaid agencies keeps transformation decisions near the levers that matter most.\nStates with Medicaid leadership also face the simultaneous pressure of H.R. 1 Medicaid cuts. The agency managing RHTP investment is the same agency managing coverage retrenchment. Whether this proximity enables coordination or creates conflicting priorities depends on leadership and political context.\nCombined Agency Structures Michigan exemplifies the combined approach: Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) integrates health, Medicaid, and social services under unified leadership. This organizational structure eliminates cross-agency coordination problems that fragment implementation elsewhere.\nCombined structures reduce authority gaps by placing related functions under common leadership. RHTP decisions about workforce development, payment reform, and service delivery align when one agency controls all three domains. The transformation vision can proceed without negotiating across bureaucratic boundaries.\nThe combined structure’s weakness is scope. An agency responsible for everything may prioritize nothing. MDHHS manages Medicaid, child welfare, mental health, aging services, public health, and now RHTP. Rural health transformation competes for leadership attention against crises in child protective services, opioid overdose mortality, and Medicaid managed care procurement. Integration creates potential; leadership focus determines whether potential converts to implementation.\nOffice of Rural Health Leadership Three states designated State Offices of Rural Health (SORH) as lead agencies or co-leads. This choice places RHTP authority with the entities possessing deepest rural health expertise, existing provider relationships, and Flex Program administration experience.\nThe authority gap is severe and predictable. SORHs typically operate with small staffs (often fewer than ten FTEs), limited budgets, and advisory rather than operational authority. They coordinate, convene, and consult but rarely control resources or direct implementation.\nA SORH designated as lead agency cannot execute RHTP’s scope without borrowing authority from elsewhere. Procurement flows through central services. Medicaid integration requires Medicaid agency cooperation. Workforce programs need higher education partnerships. The SORH contributes expertise to decisions made by others, then bears accountability for outcomes it cannot control.\nThis pattern persists because Governors recognize SORH expertise without examining SORH authority. The designation honors rural health knowledge while ignoring the gap between knowledge and power.\nThe Authority Gap What the Gap Looks Like Consider two hypothetical states with identical organizational charts: Department of Health designated as lead agency, required coordination with Medicaid, Governor approval for major expenditures.\nState A operates with genuine DOH authority. The Health Commissioner reports directly to the Governor and has established credibility over years of effective program administration. When DOH proposes RHTP subaward allocations, the Governor’s office approves without revision. When DOH interpretation of CMS requirements differs from Medicaid agency preference, DOH interpretation prevails. The organizational chart reflects actual decision-making.\nState B operates differently despite identical formal structure. The Health Commissioner is a political appointee serving at Governor’s pleasure, recently installed after the predecessor’s forced resignation. The Governor’s policy director reviews every RHTP decision, often returning proposals for revision to align with Governor priorities that may differ from optimal rural health policy. The Medicaid Director has served three Governors and built relationships that the Health Commissioner lacks. When conflicts arise, Medicaid prevails. The organizational chart shows DOH accountability; actual authority rests elsewhere.\nSame structure, opposite reality. Understanding State A requires reading the organizational chart. Understanding State B requires understanding personalities, relationships, and political dynamics the chart cannot capture.\nSources of Authority Gaps Governor’s Office Intervention: Governors nominally delegate program authority to agencies while reserving substantive decisions. Large subawards, controversial allocation choices, and politically visible programs often require Governor’s office approval regardless of formal delegation. The frequency and intensity of Governor involvement varies by issue salience, leadership style, and proximity to election cycles.\nMedicaid Control of Resources: Even when Departments of Health hold RHTP cooperative agreements, Medicaid agencies control the payment systems that determine whether transformation investments produce sustainable results. A workforce development initiative means nothing if Medicaid reimbursement cannot support the newly trained providers. DOH investment in telehealth expansion fails if Medicaid payment policy does not reimburse virtual visits adequately.\nLegislative Appropriations: State legislatures may constrain lead agency discretion through budget riders, reporting requirements, or explicit direction on RHTP priorities. A lead agency theoretically controlling federal funds may find state matching requirements directed by legislative preference rather than agency strategy.\nProcurement and Contracting: Central administrative services agencies often control procurement processes regardless of which agency holds program authority. A lead agency seeking to execute subawards may face procurement timelines, requirements, and delays imposed by agencies with no RHTP accountability.\nCivil Service Constraints: Lead agency leadership may lack authority to hire, fire, or reassign staff needed for implementation. Civil service protections, union agreements, and classification systems constrain workforce deployment regardless of program needs.\nMeasuring the Gap CMS cannot directly observe authority gaps. Organizational charts, cooperative agreements, and formal attestations reveal who should decide without showing who actually decides. Evaluation requires indicators beyond formal documentation:\nDecision Timeline Analysis: Compare time from CMS guidance issuance to state implementation decision. Delays may indicate multi-party review processes where formal lead agencies await approval from actual decision-makers.\nRevision Patterns: Track how subaward proposals, budget narratives, and strategic plans change between lead agency submission and final approval. Extensive revision suggests lead agency proposals require approval from higher authorities.\nSpokesperson Identification: Note who speaks publicly about RHTP. If Governor’s office staff, Medicaid directors, or others consistently represent RHTP decisions while lead agency officials remain silent, authority likely rests with the speakers.\nStakeholder Assessment: Ask providers, intermediaries, and community organizations who they contact when seeking RHTP decisions. Experienced stakeholders learn actual decision-making patterns regardless of formal structure.\nThe Two States The pattern plays out distinctly in two real states with similar formal structures but divergent authority realities.\nOklahoma’s Oklahoma State Department of Health serves as lead agency for RHTP, with Commissioner Heather Maughan holding responsibility for program implementation. Yet OSDH operates within a governance context that constrains its authority in specific ways. The Oklahoma Health Care Authority (OHCA), the state’s Medicaid agency, controls payment systems essential for transformation sustainability. OHCA’s SoonerSelect managed care transition proceeded independently of OSDH RHTP planning. OSDH must align its transformation investments with OHCA payment decisions it does not control.\nOklahoma’s authority gap manifests as coordination requirement rather than decision override. OSDH makes RHTP decisions within the constraint that those decisions must eventually work within OHCA payment reality. The gap is moderate: OSDH has genuine authority over direct RHTP expenditures but limited influence over the Medicaid context that determines whether those expenditures produce sustainable results.\nArizona’s Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System (AHCCCS) serves as both Medicaid agency and RHTP lead. This consolidation eliminates the coordination gap Oklahoma faces. When AHCCCS makes transformation decisions, the same agency controls payment policy. Integration is structural rather than negotiated.\nYet AHCCCS operates under Arizona’s unusual Medicaid politics. The state’s trigger law threatens automatic Medicaid expansion repeal if federal matching drops below 80%. Governor Katie Hobbs directs health policy from an office constrained by Republican legislative majorities. AHCCCS transformation decisions must navigate political context that could fundamentally alter the Medicaid landscape on which RHTP builds.\nArizona’s authority gap is low regarding cross-agency coordination but high regarding political constraint. The lead agency controls its domain but operates within political uncertainty that could invalidate planning assumptions.\nVignette: Same Title, Different Power Dr. Maria Santos and Dr. James Whitfield both hold the title “State Health Officer.” Both lead departments designated as RHTP lead agencies. Both report to Governors and manage agencies of similar size. Their experiences illustrate how identical titles produce opposite authority realities.\nDr. Santos arrived in her Southeastern state two years before RHTP, appointed by a Governor who prioritized rural health transformation. She participated in budget negotiations, testified to the legislature on rural health priorities, and built relationships with the Medicaid Director who had served under three previous Governors. When RHTP emerged, she drafted the application with her team, secured Governor endorsement without revision, and began implementation within weeks of award notification. Her proposed subaward allocations proceeded unchanged through procurement.\nDr. Whitfield arrived in his Midwestern state six months before RHTP application deadlines, appointed after his predecessor’s forced resignation following a public health data breach. The Governor’s policy director maintained direct oversight of significant health decisions, requiring weekly briefings on RHTP development. The Medicaid Director, a 22-year veteran of state government, controlled relationships with rural hospitals that Dr. Whitfield had not yet met. When Dr. Whitfield proposed RHTP priorities, the Governor’s office requested multiple revisions aligning with political sensitivities. Subaward recommendations returned from the policy director with names removed and added based on considerations Dr. Whitfield could not access.\nBoth serve as lead agency directors. Dr. Santos operates with authority matching her title. Dr. Whitfield operates within constraints that render his title more burden than power. He bears accountability for decisions others make, defending choices he did not select while navigating relationships he did not build.\nTheir states appear identical on organizational charts CMS reviews. Their implementation realities diverge completely. Dr. Santos will likely achieve implementation milestones her authority enables. Dr. Whitfield will likely miss milestones while documenting reasons CMS cannot act upon.\nThe vignette is illustrative, drawn from patterns across multiple states rather than specific officials. But the pattern recurs reliably. New appointees face authority gaps that tenured officials have navigated. Political transitions reset relationships that implementation requires. Leadership turnover during five-year RHTP implementation will produce this pattern repeatedly, as new officials inherit accountability without authority that departed officials accumulated over years.\nAlternative Perspective: The Capacity Skepticism View The argument: Authority gaps matter less than capacity gaps. Many lead agencies cannot perform required functions regardless of formal or actual authority. State health agencies lack the personnel, systems, data infrastructure, and expertise that RHTP demands. Debating authority distribution misses the point when no one has capability.\nEvidence supporting this view:\nGAO findings consistently document state agency capacity limitations. The Government Accountability Office’s 2025 High-Risk List identified 20 of 37 items stemming from agencies lacking appropriate workforce skills or sufficient employee numbers. State health agencies specifically face documented challenges in data systems, grant management, and technical expertise.\nPublic health workforce gaps persist across jurisdictions. A CDC-funded study estimated 239,000 state and local public health workers in 2022, with documented shortages in nursing, epidemiology, and program management. Categorical funding restrictions prevent agencies from hiring staff for RHTP even when positions are needed.\nPrior federal program experience suggests transformation implementation exceeds many state agencies’ operational capacity. ACA implementation revealed significant variation in state capacity to manage complex new programs. States with strong existing infrastructure performed better than states where capacity had to be built simultaneously with implementation.\nEvidence against this view:\nSome states with limited formal capacity have exceeded expectations. Maine’s public health workforce improvements demonstrated that targeted investment and leadership focus can overcome baseline capacity constraints. Leadership and political commitment appear to matter at least as much as existing capacity.\nCapacity is not fixed. Federal technical assistance, contractor support, and intermediary partnerships can supplement state agency limitations. States with honest capacity assessment and willingness to seek help may perform better than states with greater baseline capacity but less effective help-seeking.\nAssessment: Capacity skepticism has substantial merit. Many state agencies genuinely cannot perform what RHTP requires without significant external support. However, capacity constraints do not operate deterministically. Leadership focus, political support, and willingness to acknowledge limitations and seek assistance can overcome some capacity constraints that might otherwise be rate-limiting.\nAuthority gaps and capacity gaps interact. An agency with limited capacity but genuine authority can seek help to build capability. An agency with strong capacity but limited authority cannot implement what it knows how to do. The combination of capacity and authority predicts implementation success better than either alone.\nImplications for RHTP Where Authority Gaps Create Problems Sustainability Planning: RHTP requires states to plan for post-2030 sustainability. Lead agencies without authority over Medicaid payment policy cannot credibly commit to sustainable financing. Their sustainability plans describe aspirations rather than commitments, because the commitments require decisions they cannot make. When CMS evaluates sustainability plan quality, it reviews documents that lead agencies write but cannot implement without authority they do not possess.\nIntegration Initiatives: Transformation strategies requiring Medicaid alignment, behavioral health integration, or social services coordination depend on authorities beyond most lead agencies’ control. Implementation requires negotiating cooperation that formal accountability cannot compel. A behavioral health integration initiative placing mental health services in primary care settings needs Medicaid reimbursement policy supporting integrated billing. A DOH lead agency proposes the initiative; OHCA (or its equivalent) decides whether payment policy enables it.\nPerformance Accountability: CMS holds lead agencies accountable for outcomes that may depend on decisions made elsewhere. A lead agency penalized for slow implementation may have been waiting for procurement approval from an agency CMS cannot sanction. The accountability relationship between CMS and lead agencies cannot capture authority relationships between lead agencies and their state government contexts.\nResource Allocation: Authority gaps affect which activities lead agencies can fund. Direct expenditures under lead agency control may proceed efficiently. Activities requiring coordination, approval, or cooperation with other entities face delays proportional to authority gaps. Over five years, the gap accumulates: lead agencies complete work they control and struggle with work requiring distributed authority.\nWorkforce Decisions: States seeking to build implementation capacity face human resource decisions that lead agencies often cannot make. Position classifications, salary ranges, hiring authorities, and workforce deployment may reside with personnel agencies, civil service boards, or Governor’s offices rather than lead agencies. An agency needing fifteen additional staff to manage RHTP subawards cannot hire them if classification authority rests elsewhere and classification review takes eighteen months.\nWhat States Can Do Align Authority with Accountability: Where possible, designate lead agencies that actually control relevant resources and decisions. Medicaid agency leadership, while not always feasible, reduces the gap between who decides and who answers. States considering lead agency designation for future federal programs should assess authority alignment before formal designation rather than discovering gaps during implementation.\nDocument Actual Decision Processes: Move beyond organizational charts to map how decisions actually occur. Identify where lead agency proposals require approval, modification, or coordination. Plan for decision timelines that reflect actual process rather than theoretical authority. If subaward approval requires Governor’s office review, build that review into timelines rather than planning as if lead agency approval suffices.\nInvest in Relationship Infrastructure: Where authority must remain distributed, invest in coordination mechanisms that work. Joint steering committees with actual decision-making power, memoranda of understanding with enforcement provisions, and regular leader-level engagement can substitute for consolidated authority. These mechanisms require upfront investment but reduce coordination friction throughout implementation.\nSeek Help Explicitly: Lead agencies with capacity limitations serve implementation better by acknowledging gaps and seeking technical assistance than by pretending capabilities they lack. CMS technical assistance and contractor support exist. Using them requires admitting need. States that honestly assess their own limitations and seek appropriate assistance will likely outperform states that document capabilities they do not possess.\nEstablish Escalation Pathways: When coordination fails, lead agencies need mechanisms to escalate disputes beyond peer negotiation. Governor-level intervention, cabinet secretary mediation, or formal dispute resolution processes can break logjams that peer coordination cannot resolve. Establishing these pathways before implementation begins prevents disputes from stalling progress.\nWhat CMS Should Recognize Look Beyond Organizational Charts: Current CMS assessment focuses on formal documentation: cooperative agreement terms, governance structures, stakeholder attestations. Adding indicators of actual authority would improve oversight accuracy. Questions about decision timelines, approval requirements, and coordination mechanisms would reveal authority patterns that organizational charts obscure.\nDifferentiate Oversight by Authority Pattern: States with aligned authority can tolerate less intensive federal oversight. States with large authority gaps need more engagement, not punitive accountability for gaps they cannot close. Uniform oversight intensity applied regardless of authority patterns wastes federal resources on states that do not need intensive monitoring while providing insufficient support to states that do.\nProvide Technical Assistance for Coordination: Current TA focuses on program implementation. Adding TA for inter-agency coordination, authority alignment, and governance effectiveness addresses structural barriers that program TA cannot solve. States struggle less with what to do than with how to get multiple agencies to do it together.\nAccept Imperfect Accountability: The federal model of single-agency accountability cannot capture cooperative federalism’s distributed authority reality. Demanding clarity that state government cannot provide produces documentation fiction rather than improved implementation. CMS can acknowledge distributed authority while still requiring honest reporting about how that distribution affects implementation.\nRecognize Leadership Transitions: Authority accumulates with tenure. New appointees lack relationships and credibility that implementation requires. CMS should expect implementation disruption following leadership transitions and provide targeted support during transition periods rather than maintaining uniform expectations that ignore transition realities.\nConclusion The lead agency designation creates formal accountability that reality frequently undermines. Organizational charts show who should decide; investigation reveals who actually decides. The gap between formal and actual authority shapes implementation more than strategic plans acknowledge.\nThis finding should not surprise. State government has always operated through relationships, politics, and informal authority that formal structures obscure. RHTP’s innovation lies in its scale and transformation ambition, not in revealing distributed authority that has always characterized state administration.\nThe practical implications matter. Lead agencies cannot implement what they do not control. Transformation requires authority across domains no single agency controls. Success depends on coordination mechanisms that bridge authority gaps rather than pretending consolidated authority exists.\nSeries 5 continues by examining how lead agencies coordinate with other state entities (5B), procure and contract for implementation (5C), measure performance (5D), and manage federal relationships (5E). Each function confronts the authority gap this article establishes. Understanding the gap prevents naive assumptions that formal responsibility translates to actual implementation control.\nCross-References 2A (RHTP Structure and Rules): Federal statutory framework and lead agency requirements 3 State Profiles: State-specific lead agency arrangements documented across 50 profiles 5B (Stakeholder Coordination): How lead agencies work with entities holding complementary authority 5E (Federal-State Relationship): How authority gaps affect CMS oversight effectiveness Sources Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System. “RHTP Application: Arizona’s Rural Health Transformation Plan.” AHCCCS, Nov. 2025.\nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services. “Rural Health Transformation Program Notice of Funding Opportunity.” CMS, Apr. 2025.\nConnecticut Department of Social Services. “Connecticut Rural Health Transformation Program Application.” CT DSS, Nov. 2025.\nGovernment Accountability Office. “GAO-25-107002: Public Health Preparedness: HHS and Jurisdictions Have Taken Some Steps to Address Challenging Workforce Gaps.” GAO, Jan. 2025.\nGovernment Accountability Office. “GAO-24-105891: Public Health Preparedness: Building and Maintaining Infrastructure beyond the COVID-19 Pandemic.” GAO, 2024.\nMichigan Department of Health and Human Services. “Michigan RHTP Application and Implementation Plan.” MDHHS, Nov. 2025.\nMissouri Department of Social Services. “Missouri Rural Health Transformation Program Application.” MO DSS, Nov. 2025.\nNational Academy for State Health Policy. “Public Health Modernization Toolkit: Key Commitments, Priorities, and Strategies.” NASHP, Apr. 2025.\nOhio Department of Health. “Ohio Rural Health Transformation Program Application: Rural Patient Health Innovation.” ODH, Nov. 2025.\nOklahoma State Department of Health. “Oklahoma Rural Health Transformation Program Application.” OSDH, Nov. 2025.\nRhode Island Executive Office of Health and Human Services. “Rhode Island RHTP Application.” RI EOHHS, Nov. 2025.\nTrust for America’s Health. “Promoting Health and Cost Control in States (PHACCS) Initiative.” TFAH, Dec. 2025.\nSeries 5: State Agencies Rural Health Transformation Project Version 1: January 2026\n",

</div>

<p>Every state RHTP application names a lead agency. CMS requires it. Governors designate it. Organizational charts display it. The designation creates formal accountability: one entity responsible for $2 billion to $500 million in federal investment, answerable for outcomes affecting millions of rural residents.</p>
<p><strong>The accountability is often an illusion.</strong> Organizational charts show who should decide. Reality reveals who actually decides. These frequently diverge, and the gap between formal and actual authority shapes implementation more than any strategic plan.</p>
<p>Series 5 examines state agencies as RHTP implementers. This first article establishes the foundation: how lead agency structures create accountability theater while actual decision-making authority flows through channels the formal structure obscures. Understanding this gap matters because CMS holds lead agencies accountable for outcomes they sometimes cannot control, while actual decision-makers face no federal oversight.</p>
<p>The tension between formal accountability and actual authority is not a flaw to be corrected. It reflects the inherent messiness of cooperative federalism, where federal funds flow through state bureaucracies shaped by political incentives, historical organizational choices, and leadership personalities that no NOFO can standardize.</p>
<h2 id="the-federal-framework">The Federal Framework<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-federal-framework">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="cms-requirements">CMS Requirements<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#cms-requirements">#</a></h3>
<p>The RHTP Notice of Funding Opportunity mandates <strong>Governor designation of a single lead agency</strong> to submit applications and manage implementation. This single-agency accountability model assumes clear lines of authority: one entity responsible, one entity accountable, one entity answerable to CMS for program performance.</p>
<p><strong>Lead agency responsibilities under federal requirements include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cooperative agreement execution and compliance</li>
<li>Subaward administration and oversight</li>
<li>Performance monitoring and reporting</li>
<li>Financial management and audit response</li>
<li>Stakeholder coordination documentation</li>
<li>Annual progress reports and budget narratives</li>
</ul>
<p>CMS cannot split accountability across multiple state entities. The agency learned from prior programs that shared responsibility produces diffuse accountability where no one answers for failures. RHTP&rsquo;s design demands someone be responsible.</p>
<h3 id="what-federal-requirements-miss">What Federal Requirements Miss<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-federal-requirements-miss">#</a></h3>
<p>The federal framework assumes the lead agency designated on paper controls the resources and decisions required to perform its functions. <strong>This assumption frequently fails in practice.</strong></p>
<p>Governors may designate a Department of Health as lead agency while reserving substantive decisions for the Governor&rsquo;s office. State Medicaid agencies may control funding flows regardless of which agency holds the cooperative agreement. Legislative budget processes may constrain lead agency discretion. Procurement rules administered by separate agencies may delay implementation regardless of lead agency urgency.</p>
<p>CMS designed RHTP accountability for an organizational clarity that state government rarely provides. The result is a <strong>formal accountability structure overlaid on actual authority patterns it cannot see or influence</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="the-consultation-requirement">The Consultation Requirement<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-consultation-requirement">#</a></h3>
<p>Applications must document consultation with specified stakeholders regardless of lead agency designation: state Medicaid agencies, State Offices of Rural Health, tribal affairs offices, providers, and communities. This requirement acknowledges that lead agencies lack complete authority and must coordinate with entities holding complementary powers.</p>
<p>But consultation is not authority. A Department of Health can document extensive Medicaid agency consultation while that agency makes implementation decisions the lead agency cannot override. The consultation requirement creates documentation without ensuring coordination.</p>
<h2 id="lead-agency-designation-patterns">Lead Agency Designation Patterns<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#lead-agency-designation-patterns">#</a></h2>
<p>Across 50 states, lead agency designations cluster into distinct patterns with different implications for the relationship between formal accountability and actual authority.</p>

<h3 id="department-of-health-leadership">Department of Health Leadership<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#department-of-health-leadership">#</a></h3>
<p>The most common designation places <strong>State Departments of Health</strong> in the lead agency role. This choice reflects DOH traditional responsibility for population health programs, existing rural health office infrastructure, and established relationships with rural providers through Flex Program administration.</p>
<p>DOH leadership works well when the department controls sufficient resources and decision authority. It fails when Medicaid agencies control payment systems that determine provider viability, when Governor&rsquo;s offices override strategic decisions, or when DOH lacks implementation capacity that more operational agencies possess.</p>
<p><strong>The DOH gap pattern emerges in states where health policy authority has migrated to Medicaid over decades while formal DOH responsibility remained.</strong> Medicaid expansion, managed care transitions, and payment reform initiatives accumulated at Medicaid agencies while DOH retained population health programs with smaller budgets and less policy impact. DOH designation for RHTP places accountability where authority once resided but has since departed.</p>
<h3 id="medicaid-agency-leadership">Medicaid Agency Leadership<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#medicaid-agency-leadership">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>States where Medicaid agencies lead RHTP show smaller authority gaps.</strong> This pattern appears in Arizona (AHCCCS), Rhode Island (EOHHS), Connecticut (DSS), and Missouri (DSS), where agencies responsible for RHTP hold cooperative agreements.</p>
<p>The alignment logic is straightforward. Medicaid agencies control the payment systems that determine whether rural healthcare remains viable. They manage the eligibility systems that determine coverage. They negotiate with managed care organizations that increasingly dominate rural markets. Placing RHTP authority at Medicaid agencies keeps transformation decisions near the levers that matter most.</p>
<p>States with Medicaid leadership also face the simultaneous pressure of H.R. 1 Medicaid cuts. The agency managing RHTP investment is the same agency managing coverage retrenchment. Whether this proximity enables coordination or creates conflicting priorities depends on leadership and political context.</p>
<h3 id="combined-agency-structures">Combined Agency Structures<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#combined-agency-structures">#</a></h3>
<p>Michigan exemplifies the combined approach: <strong>Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS)</strong> integrates health, Medicaid, and social services under unified leadership. This organizational structure eliminates cross-agency coordination problems that fragment implementation elsewhere.</p>
<p>Combined structures reduce authority gaps by placing related functions under common leadership. RHTP decisions about workforce development, payment reform, and service delivery align when one agency controls all three domains. The transformation vision can proceed without negotiating across bureaucratic boundaries.</p>
<p><strong>The combined structure&rsquo;s weakness is scope.</strong> An agency responsible for everything may prioritize nothing. MDHHS manages Medicaid, child welfare, mental health, aging services, public health, and now RHTP. Rural health transformation competes for leadership attention against crises in child protective services, opioid overdose mortality, and Medicaid managed care procurement. Integration creates potential; leadership focus determines whether potential converts to implementation.</p>
<h3 id="office-of-rural-health-leadership">Office of Rural Health Leadership<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#office-of-rural-health-leadership">#</a></h3>
<p>Three states designated <strong>State Offices of Rural Health (SORH)</strong> as lead agencies or co-leads. This choice places RHTP authority with the entities possessing deepest rural health expertise, existing provider relationships, and Flex Program administration experience.</p>
<p>The authority gap is <strong>severe and predictable</strong>. SORHs typically operate with small staffs (often fewer than ten FTEs), limited budgets, and advisory rather than operational authority. They coordinate, convene, and consult but rarely control resources or direct implementation.</p>
<p>A SORH designated as lead agency cannot execute RHTP&rsquo;s scope without borrowing authority from elsewhere. Procurement flows through central services. Medicaid integration requires Medicaid agency cooperation. Workforce programs need higher education partnerships. The SORH contributes expertise to decisions made by others, then bears accountability for outcomes it cannot control.</p>
<p>This pattern persists because Governors recognize SORH expertise without examining SORH authority. The designation honors rural health knowledge while ignoring the gap between knowledge and power.</p>
<h2 id="the-authority-gap">The Authority Gap<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-authority-gap">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="what-the-gap-looks-like">What the Gap Looks Like<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-the-gap-looks-like">#</a></h3>
<p>Consider two hypothetical states with identical organizational charts: Department of Health designated as lead agency, required coordination with Medicaid, Governor approval for major expenditures.</p>
<p><strong>State A</strong> operates with genuine DOH authority. The Health Commissioner reports directly to the Governor and has established credibility over years of effective program administration. When DOH proposes RHTP subaward allocations, the Governor&rsquo;s office approves without revision. When DOH interpretation of CMS requirements differs from Medicaid agency preference, DOH interpretation prevails. The organizational chart reflects actual decision-making.</p>
<p><strong>State B</strong> operates differently despite identical formal structure. The Health Commissioner is a political appointee serving at Governor&rsquo;s pleasure, recently installed after the predecessor&rsquo;s forced resignation. The Governor&rsquo;s policy director reviews every RHTP decision, often returning proposals for revision to align with Governor priorities that may differ from optimal rural health policy. The Medicaid Director has served three Governors and built relationships that the Health Commissioner lacks. When conflicts arise, Medicaid prevails. The organizational chart shows DOH accountability; actual authority rests elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Same structure, opposite reality.</strong> Understanding State A requires reading the organizational chart. Understanding State B requires understanding personalities, relationships, and political dynamics the chart cannot capture.</p>
<h3 id="sources-of-authority-gaps">Sources of Authority Gaps<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#sources-of-authority-gaps">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Governor&rsquo;s Office Intervention:</strong> Governors nominally delegate program authority to agencies while reserving substantive decisions. Large subawards, controversial allocation choices, and politically visible programs often require Governor&rsquo;s office approval regardless of formal delegation. The frequency and intensity of Governor involvement varies by issue salience, leadership style, and proximity to election cycles.</p>
<p><strong>Medicaid Control of Resources:</strong> Even when Departments of Health hold RHTP cooperative agreements, Medicaid agencies control the payment systems that determine whether transformation investments produce sustainable results. A workforce development initiative means nothing if Medicaid reimbursement cannot support the newly trained providers. DOH investment in telehealth expansion fails if Medicaid payment policy does not reimburse virtual visits adequately.</p>
<p><strong>Legislative Appropriations:</strong> State legislatures may constrain lead agency discretion through budget riders, reporting requirements, or explicit direction on RHTP priorities. A lead agency theoretically controlling federal funds may find state matching requirements directed by legislative preference rather than agency strategy.</p>
<p><strong>Procurement and Contracting:</strong> Central administrative services agencies often control procurement processes regardless of which agency holds program authority. A lead agency seeking to execute subawards may face procurement timelines, requirements, and delays imposed by agencies with no RHTP accountability.</p>
<p><strong>Civil Service Constraints:</strong> Lead agency leadership may lack authority to hire, fire, or reassign staff needed for implementation. Civil service protections, union agreements, and classification systems constrain workforce deployment regardless of program needs.</p>
<h3 id="measuring-the-gap">Measuring the Gap<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#measuring-the-gap">#</a></h3>
<p>CMS cannot directly observe authority gaps. Organizational charts, cooperative agreements, and formal attestations reveal who should decide without showing who actually decides. Evaluation requires indicators beyond formal documentation:</p>
<p><strong>Decision Timeline Analysis:</strong> Compare time from CMS guidance issuance to state implementation decision. Delays may indicate multi-party review processes where formal lead agencies await approval from actual decision-makers.</p>
<p><strong>Revision Patterns:</strong> Track how subaward proposals, budget narratives, and strategic plans change between lead agency submission and final approval. Extensive revision suggests lead agency proposals require approval from higher authorities.</p>
<p><strong>Spokesperson Identification:</strong> Note who speaks publicly about RHTP. If Governor&rsquo;s office staff, Medicaid directors, or others consistently represent RHTP decisions while lead agency officials remain silent, authority likely rests with the speakers.</p>
<p><strong>Stakeholder Assessment:</strong> Ask providers, intermediaries, and community organizations who they contact when seeking RHTP decisions. Experienced stakeholders learn actual decision-making patterns regardless of formal structure.</p>
<h2 id="the-two-states">The Two States<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-two-states">#</a></h2>
<p>The pattern plays out distinctly in two real states with similar formal structures but divergent authority realities.</p>
<p><strong>Oklahoma&rsquo;s Oklahoma State Department of Health</strong> serves as lead agency for RHTP, with Commissioner Heather Maughan holding responsibility for program implementation. Yet OSDH operates within a governance context that constrains its authority in specific ways. The Oklahoma Health Care Authority (OHCA), the state&rsquo;s Medicaid agency, controls payment systems essential for transformation sustainability. OHCA&rsquo;s SoonerSelect managed care transition proceeded independently of OSDH RHTP planning. OSDH must align its transformation investments with OHCA payment decisions it does not control.</p>
<p>Oklahoma&rsquo;s authority gap manifests as coordination requirement rather than decision override. OSDH makes RHTP decisions within the constraint that those decisions must eventually work within OHCA payment reality. The gap is <strong>moderate</strong>: OSDH has genuine authority over direct RHTP expenditures but limited influence over the Medicaid context that determines whether those expenditures produce sustainable results.</p>
<p><strong>Arizona&rsquo;s Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System (AHCCCS)</strong> serves as both Medicaid agency and RHTP lead. This consolidation eliminates the coordination gap Oklahoma faces. When AHCCCS makes transformation decisions, the same agency controls payment policy. Integration is structural rather than negotiated.</p>
<p>Yet AHCCCS operates under Arizona&rsquo;s unusual Medicaid politics. The state&rsquo;s trigger law threatens automatic Medicaid expansion repeal if federal matching drops below 80%. Governor Katie Hobbs directs health policy from an office constrained by Republican legislative majorities. AHCCCS transformation decisions must navigate political context that could fundamentally alter the Medicaid landscape on which RHTP builds.</p>
<p>Arizona&rsquo;s authority gap is <strong>low</strong> regarding cross-agency coordination but <strong>high</strong> regarding political constraint. The lead agency controls its domain but operates within political uncertainty that could invalidate planning assumptions.</p>
<h3 id="vignette-same-title-different-power">Vignette: Same Title, Different Power<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#vignette-same-title-different-power">#</a></h3>
<p>Dr. Maria Santos and Dr. James Whitfield both hold the title &ldquo;State Health Officer.&rdquo; Both lead departments designated as RHTP lead agencies. Both report to Governors and manage agencies of similar size. Their experiences illustrate how identical titles produce opposite authority realities.</p>
<p>Dr. Santos arrived in her Southeastern state two years before RHTP, appointed by a Governor who prioritized rural health transformation. She participated in budget negotiations, testified to the legislature on rural health priorities, and built relationships with the Medicaid Director who had served under three previous Governors. When RHTP emerged, she drafted the application with her team, secured Governor endorsement without revision, and began implementation within weeks of award notification. Her proposed subaward allocations proceeded unchanged through procurement.</p>
<p>Dr. Whitfield arrived in his Midwestern state six months before RHTP application deadlines, appointed after his predecessor&rsquo;s forced resignation following a public health data breach. The Governor&rsquo;s policy director maintained direct oversight of significant health decisions, requiring weekly briefings on RHTP development. The Medicaid Director, a 22-year veteran of state government, controlled relationships with rural hospitals that Dr. Whitfield had not yet met. When Dr. Whitfield proposed RHTP priorities, the Governor&rsquo;s office requested multiple revisions aligning with political sensitivities. Subaward recommendations returned from the policy director with names removed and added based on considerations Dr. Whitfield could not access.</p>
<p>Both serve as lead agency directors. Dr. Santos operates with authority matching her title. Dr. Whitfield operates within constraints that render his title more burden than power. He bears accountability for decisions others make, defending choices he did not select while navigating relationships he did not build.</p>
<p>Their states appear identical on organizational charts CMS reviews. Their implementation realities diverge completely. Dr. Santos will likely achieve implementation milestones her authority enables. Dr. Whitfield will likely miss milestones while documenting reasons CMS cannot act upon.</p>
<p><strong>The vignette is illustrative, drawn from patterns across multiple states rather than specific officials.</strong> But the pattern recurs reliably. New appointees face authority gaps that tenured officials have navigated. Political transitions reset relationships that implementation requires. Leadership turnover during five-year RHTP implementation will produce this pattern repeatedly, as new officials inherit accountability without authority that departed officials accumulated over years.</p>
<h2 id="alternative-perspective-the-capacity-skepticism-view">Alternative Perspective: The Capacity Skepticism View<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#alternative-perspective-the-capacity-skepticism-view">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>The argument:</strong> Authority gaps matter less than capacity gaps. Many lead agencies cannot perform required functions regardless of formal or actual authority. State health agencies lack the personnel, systems, data infrastructure, and expertise that RHTP demands. Debating authority distribution misses the point when no one has capability.</p>
<p><strong>Evidence supporting this view:</strong></p>
<p>GAO findings consistently document state agency capacity limitations. The Government Accountability Office&rsquo;s 2025 High-Risk List identified 20 of 37 items stemming from agencies lacking appropriate workforce skills or sufficient employee numbers. State health agencies specifically face documented challenges in data systems, grant management, and technical expertise.</p>
<p>Public health workforce gaps persist across jurisdictions. A CDC-funded study estimated 239,000 state and local public health workers in 2022, with documented shortages in nursing, epidemiology, and program management. Categorical funding restrictions prevent agencies from hiring staff for RHTP even when positions are needed.</p>
<p>Prior federal program experience suggests transformation implementation exceeds many state agencies&rsquo; operational capacity. ACA implementation revealed significant variation in state capacity to manage complex new programs. States with strong existing infrastructure performed better than states where capacity had to be built simultaneously with implementation.</p>
<p><strong>Evidence against this view:</strong></p>
<p>Some states with limited formal capacity have exceeded expectations. Maine&rsquo;s public health workforce improvements demonstrated that targeted investment and leadership focus can overcome baseline capacity constraints. Leadership and political commitment appear to matter at least as much as existing capacity.</p>
<p>Capacity is not fixed. Federal technical assistance, contractor support, and intermediary partnerships can supplement state agency limitations. States with honest capacity assessment and willingness to seek help may perform better than states with greater baseline capacity but less effective help-seeking.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment:</strong> Capacity skepticism has substantial merit. Many state agencies genuinely cannot perform what RHTP requires without significant external support. However, capacity constraints do not operate deterministically. Leadership focus, political support, and willingness to acknowledge limitations and seek assistance can overcome some capacity constraints that might otherwise be rate-limiting.</p>
<p>Authority gaps and capacity gaps interact. An agency with limited capacity but genuine authority can seek help to build capability. An agency with strong capacity but limited authority cannot implement what it knows how to do. The combination of capacity and authority predicts implementation success better than either alone.</p>
<h2 id="implications-for-rhtp">Implications for RHTP<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#implications-for-rhtp">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="where-authority-gaps-create-problems">Where Authority Gaps Create Problems<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#where-authority-gaps-create-problems">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Sustainability Planning:</strong> RHTP requires states to plan for post-2030 sustainability. Lead agencies without authority over Medicaid payment policy cannot credibly commit to sustainable financing. Their sustainability plans describe aspirations rather than commitments, because the commitments require decisions they cannot make. When CMS evaluates sustainability plan quality, it reviews documents that lead agencies write but cannot implement without authority they do not possess.</p>
<p><strong>Integration Initiatives:</strong> Transformation strategies requiring Medicaid alignment, behavioral health integration, or social services coordination depend on authorities beyond most lead agencies&rsquo; control. Implementation requires negotiating cooperation that formal accountability cannot compel. A behavioral health integration initiative placing mental health services in primary care settings needs Medicaid reimbursement policy supporting integrated billing. A DOH lead agency proposes the initiative; OHCA (or its equivalent) decides whether payment policy enables it.</p>
<p><strong>Performance Accountability:</strong> CMS holds lead agencies accountable for outcomes that may depend on decisions made elsewhere. A lead agency penalized for slow implementation may have been waiting for procurement approval from an agency CMS cannot sanction. The accountability relationship between CMS and lead agencies cannot capture authority relationships between lead agencies and their state government contexts.</p>
<p><strong>Resource Allocation:</strong> Authority gaps affect which activities lead agencies can fund. Direct expenditures under lead agency control may proceed efficiently. Activities requiring coordination, approval, or cooperation with other entities face delays proportional to authority gaps. Over five years, the gap accumulates: lead agencies complete work they control and struggle with work requiring distributed authority.</p>
<p><strong>Workforce Decisions:</strong> States seeking to build implementation capacity face human resource decisions that lead agencies often cannot make. Position classifications, salary ranges, hiring authorities, and workforce deployment may reside with personnel agencies, civil service boards, or Governor&rsquo;s offices rather than lead agencies. An agency needing fifteen additional staff to manage RHTP subawards cannot hire them if classification authority rests elsewhere and classification review takes eighteen months.</p>
<h3 id="what-states-can-do">What States Can Do<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-states-can-do">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Align Authority with Accountability:</strong> Where possible, designate lead agencies that actually control relevant resources and decisions. Medicaid agency leadership, while not always feasible, reduces the gap between who decides and who answers. States considering lead agency designation for future federal programs should assess authority alignment before formal designation rather than discovering gaps during implementation.</p>
<p><strong>Document Actual Decision Processes:</strong> Move beyond organizational charts to map how decisions actually occur. Identify where lead agency proposals require approval, modification, or coordination. Plan for decision timelines that reflect actual process rather than theoretical authority. If subaward approval requires Governor&rsquo;s office review, build that review into timelines rather than planning as if lead agency approval suffices.</p>
<p><strong>Invest in Relationship Infrastructure:</strong> Where authority must remain distributed, invest in coordination mechanisms that work. Joint steering committees with actual decision-making power, memoranda of understanding with enforcement provisions, and regular leader-level engagement can substitute for consolidated authority. These mechanisms require upfront investment but reduce coordination friction throughout implementation.</p>
<p><strong>Seek Help Explicitly:</strong> Lead agencies with capacity limitations serve implementation better by acknowledging gaps and seeking technical assistance than by pretending capabilities they lack. CMS technical assistance and contractor support exist. Using them requires admitting need. States that honestly assess their own limitations and seek appropriate assistance will likely outperform states that document capabilities they do not possess.</p>
<p><strong>Establish Escalation Pathways:</strong> When coordination fails, lead agencies need mechanisms to escalate disputes beyond peer negotiation. Governor-level intervention, cabinet secretary mediation, or formal dispute resolution processes can break logjams that peer coordination cannot resolve. Establishing these pathways before implementation begins prevents disputes from stalling progress.</p>
<h3 id="what-cms-should-recognize">What CMS Should Recognize<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-cms-should-recognize">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Look Beyond Organizational Charts:</strong> Current CMS assessment focuses on formal documentation: cooperative agreement terms, governance structures, stakeholder attestations. Adding indicators of actual authority would improve oversight accuracy. Questions about decision timelines, approval requirements, and coordination mechanisms would reveal authority patterns that organizational charts obscure.</p>
<p><strong>Differentiate Oversight by Authority Pattern:</strong> States with aligned authority can tolerate less intensive federal oversight. States with large authority gaps need more engagement, not punitive accountability for gaps they cannot close. Uniform oversight intensity applied regardless of authority patterns wastes federal resources on states that do not need intensive monitoring while providing insufficient support to states that do.</p>
<p><strong>Provide Technical Assistance for Coordination:</strong> Current TA focuses on program implementation. Adding TA for inter-agency coordination, authority alignment, and governance effectiveness addresses structural barriers that program TA cannot solve. States struggle less with what to do than with how to get multiple agencies to do it together.</p>
<p><strong>Accept Imperfect Accountability:</strong> The federal model of single-agency accountability cannot capture cooperative federalism&rsquo;s distributed authority reality. Demanding clarity that state government cannot provide produces documentation fiction rather than improved implementation. CMS can acknowledge distributed authority while still requiring honest reporting about how that distribution affects implementation.</p>
<p><strong>Recognize Leadership Transitions:</strong> Authority accumulates with tenure. New appointees lack relationships and credibility that implementation requires. CMS should expect implementation disruption following leadership transitions and provide targeted support during transition periods rather than maintaining uniform expectations that ignore transition realities.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>The lead agency designation creates formal accountability that reality frequently undermines. Organizational charts show who should decide; investigation reveals who actually decides. The gap between formal and actual authority shapes implementation more than strategic plans acknowledge.</p>
<p>This finding should not surprise. State government has always operated through relationships, politics, and informal authority that formal structures obscure. RHTP&rsquo;s innovation lies in its scale and transformation ambition, not in revealing distributed authority that has always characterized state administration.</p>
<p>The practical implications matter. Lead agencies cannot implement what they do not control. Transformation requires authority across domains no single agency controls. Success depends on coordination mechanisms that bridge authority gaps rather than pretending consolidated authority exists.</p>
<p>Series 5 continues by examining how lead agencies coordinate with other state entities (5B), procure and contract for implementation (5C), measure performance (5D), and manage federal relationships (5E). Each function confronts the authority gap this article establishes. Understanding the gap prevents naive assumptions that formal responsibility translates to actual implementation control.</p>
