  "articleBody": "The organizational chart shows the Department of Health as lead agency. The Governor’s office makes the decisions. The organizational chart shows stakeholder coordination through a formal advisory committee. The hospital association lobbyist makes the calls that matter. The organizational chart shows clear lines of authority. Reality reveals authority so distributed that no one can act decisively.\nState agency structures are supposed to shape implementation outcomes. This assumption underlies CMS requirements, state planning, and federal accountability mechanisms. Series 5 examined this assumption across five domains: lead agency authority, stakeholder coordination, procurement processes, performance measurement, and federal relationships. The evidence suggests the assumption is partially correct but fundamentally incomplete.\nAgency structures matter, but they matter less than how those structures function in practice, less than the relationships that animate them, and less than the political context that constrains them. States with identical organizational models produce dramatically different results. States with problematic structures sometimes outperform states with aligned authority. The explanation lies not in charts and procedures but in leadership focus, relationship quality, and political commitment that no organizational design can guarantee.\nThis synthesis integrates findings across Series 5 to address the core question: do state agency structures determine implementation success, or do other factors matter more? The answer matters because it shapes where improvement efforts should focus. If structures determine outcomes, restructuring should precede implementation. If other factors dominate, restructuring wastes time that should go to relationship building, capacity development, and political cultivation.\nPart I: What Series 5 Documented The Five Domains Series 5 examined state agency functions through fundamental tensions that every state must navigate regardless of organizational design.\n5A: Lead Agency Structures examined the gap between formal accountability and actual authority. CMS requires governors to designate single lead agencies, creating accountability that organizational charts display but reality frequently undermines. Lead agencies responsible for implementation often lack control over the resources, decisions, and coordination required to implement. The finding matters because CMS holds agencies accountable for outcomes they cannot control, while actual decision-makers face no federal oversight.\n5B: Stakeholder Coordination examined the tension between centralized efficiency and distributed knowledge. Federal requirements mandate stakeholder engagement. States document committees, meetings, and participation. But advisory committees meet while they do not govern; communities participate while they do not decide. Coordination structures predominantly create appearance of distributed input while concentrating actual authority at state agencies.\n5C: Procurement and Contracting examined the tension between process compliance and outcome achievement. State procurement regulations protect against fraud and favoritism. They also impede transformation timelines. States cannot recruit subawardees, select vendors, or execute contracts at the speed RHTP implementation requires. The process compliance that protects integrity actively undermines performance.\n5D: Performance Measurement examined the tension between accountability demands and capacity limitations. CMS requires sophisticated measurement systems. Many state agencies lack capacity to produce meaningful data. The result is compliance theater: reports that satisfy requirements without enabling learning. States optimize for metrics rather than outcomes, producing measurement that performs accountability rather than informing improvement.\n5E: Federal-State Relationship examined the tension between federal mandate and state autonomy. RHTP uses cooperative agreement language implying partnership. Reality involves federal mandates, state compliance, and contested authority. Relationship quality varies dramatically across states, and those relationships, not federal requirements, determine whether the same processes enable or obstruct implementation.\nPatterns Across Domains The five articles reveal consistent patterns that transcend any single function.\nPattern 1: Formal structures predict little. States with aligned formal authority sometimes underperform states with fragmented authority. States with comprehensive stakeholder structures sometimes produce worse community engagement than states with minimal formal processes. The gap between what organizational charts show and what actually happens is large and consequential.\nPattern 2: Relationships matter more than structures. A collaborative CMS relationship transforms compliance burden into implementation support. A functional relationship between the lead agency director and governor’s health advisor enables authority exercise that no organizational chart can capture. Personal trust between state officials and provider associations accelerates stakeholder coordination beyond what formal processes accomplish.\nPattern 3: Capacity constrains everything. States lacking procurement staff cannot execute timely contracts regardless of streamlined processes. States lacking evaluation expertise cannot produce meaningful measurement regardless of federal requirements. States lacking qualified personnel cannot implement programs regardless of available funding. Capacity is the rate-limiting factor that structural optimization cannot address.\nPattern 4: Political context shapes agency behavior. Agencies serve governors who face electoral incentives. Rural health competes with other priorities for gubernatorial attention. Legislative budget processes constrain agency discretion. Provider interests exercise political influence that shapes what agencies can accomplish. Structural analysis that ignores political economy produces naive recommendations.\nPattern 5: The appearance of compliance substitutes for substance. States document stakeholder engagement while stakeholders do not influence decisions. States report performance metrics while metrics do not inform strategy. States create coordination structures while coordination does not occur. The gap between documentation and practice is systematic, not exceptional.\nPart II: The Fundamental Tensions Revisited Series 5 identified five fundamental tensions that every state navigates. Synthesis requires assessing which approaches to these tensions the evidence supports.\nTension 1: Federal Mandate vs. State Autonomy The federal view emphasizes accountability. CMS holds $50 billion in public funds. Congressional appropriators and GAO auditors will scrutinize every dollar. Without federal requirements, states will underperform, misspend, or direct funds to incumbent providers without demanding change.\nThe state view emphasizes flexibility. Rural health challenges vary dramatically across states. Rigid federal requirements force states into ill-fitting templates. States understand local conditions better than CMS. Micromanagement consumes capacity that should serve implementation.\nWhat the evidence supports: Both views have merit. Federal requirements have prevented misuse in some contexts. Federal rigidity has hindered transformation in others. The evidence does not support either pure federal control or pure state autonomy. It supports differentiated oversight based on state capacity and relationship quality. High-capacity states with collaborative relationships can function with lighter federal touch. Low-capacity states with adversarial relationships may require more intensive engagement, though that engagement should enable rather than merely monitor.\nTension 2: Capacity vs. Accountability The accountability view holds that federal funds require accountability. States that cannot perform should not receive funds. Requirements should be uniform because differential treatment invites gaming.\nThe capacity realism view holds that demanding sophisticated performance from under-resourced agencies is pointless. Low-capacity states cannot meet requirements regardless of mandates. Requirements that exceed capacity produce compliance theater rather than meaningful accountability.\nWhat the evidence supports: The capacity realism view has substantial merit that accountability frameworks underweight. States cannot produce capacity they lack because CMS requires it. Requirements that exceed state capacity generate documentation fiction, not improved implementation. The evidence supports capacity-appropriate accountability: simpler requirements for states with limited capacity, with federal investment in capacity building as a legitimate RHTP use.\nTension 3: Formal Authority vs. Actual Practice The formal authority view assumes organizational charts reflect reality. Designating a lead agency creates accountability. Establishing coordination structures produces coordination. Requiring measurement generates data.\nThe actual practice view observes that designated authority frequently diverges from decision authority. Governors make decisions regardless of which agency holds cooperative agreements. Informal relationships shape outcomes that formal processes cannot capture. Authority accumulates with tenure, relationships, and political capital rather than organizational designation.\nWhat the evidence supports: The actual practice view dominates. Lead agencies frequently cannot control what they are held accountable for. Stakeholder coordination structures predominantly create appearance rather than substance. Procurement processes serve compliance more than outcomes. The gap between formal and actual authority is large, systematic, and consequential for implementation. CMS monitoring that assumes formal authority reflects reality produces misleading assessments.\nTension 4: Centralized Control vs. Local Knowledge The centralized control view emphasizes efficiency. State agencies can standardize approaches, aggregate purchasing power, ensure equity across regions, and maintain accountability that distributed implementation cannot achieve.\nThe local knowledge view emphasizes effectiveness. Rural communities vary dramatically. State agencies cannot understand local contexts. Effective implementation requires community authority to adapt strategies to local circumstances. Centralized control produces uniform approaches that fit nowhere well.\nWhat the evidence supports: Neither extreme performs well. Pure centralization ignores local variation that matters. Pure decentralization fragments accountability and enables capture by local interests. The evidence supports structured flexibility: state frameworks that enable local adaptation within defined parameters, with accountability for outcomes rather than process compliance. This middle path requires more sophisticated state capacity than either extreme.\nTension 5: Process Compliance vs. Outcome Achievement The process compliance view emphasizes integrity. Procurement rules prevent corruption. Measurement requirements ensure accountability. Documentation creates audit trails. Without process compliance, programs invite fraud and favoritism.\nThe outcome achievement view emphasizes results. Rigid processes impede implementation. Compliance burden consumes capacity that should serve communities. Procurement timelines that protect integrity undermine performance. Measurement that satisfies requirements without informing decisions wastes resources.\nWhat the evidence supports: Process compliance has value that outcome enthusiasts underweight, particularly in states with histories of misuse. But current compliance requirements in many states substantially exceed what integrity protection requires. The evidence supports streamlined processes that maintain essential safeguards while enabling implementation speed. States that have achieved this balance outperform states locked in compliance rigidity.\nPart III: The Alternative Perspectives Assessed Series 5 surfaced several alternative perspectives that challenge conventional assumptions about state agency implementation.\nThe Political Economy View The argument: State agency decisions reflect political incentives, not optimal implementation. Governors reward allies. Agencies protect turf. Procurement favors connected vendors. Understanding implementation requires analyzing political dynamics rather than assuming rational bureaucratic behavior.\nEvidence supporting: Subaward patterns in many states correlate with political relationships. Lead agency designations reflect gubernatorial staffing preferences as much as functional logic. Advisory committee appointments favor politically connected organizations.\nEvidence against: Some states demonstrate genuine evidence-based decision-making. Political incentives sometimes align with effective implementation. Not all political considerations undermine program goals.\nAssessment: The political economy view has substantial explanatory power. Structural analysis that ignores political context produces recommendations that assume incentives not present in practice. Effective implementation requires either aligning political incentives with program goals or insulating implementation from political interference. Neither is easy, but pretending politics does not shape agency behavior guarantees naive analysis.\nThe Capacity Realism View The argument: Demanding sophisticated implementation from under-resourced agencies is pointless. Many state rural health offices have fewer than ten staff members administering programs serving millions of residents. Complex federal requirements overwhelm limited capacity.\nEvidence supporting: Low-capacity states produce lower-quality implementation across every function examined. Compliance burden falls disproportionately on states least able to bear it. Some states cannot execute basic procurement within RHTP timelines regardless of streamlined processes.\nEvidence against: Some low-resource states outperform better-resourced peers through focused priorities and effective leadership. Capacity is not purely a function of resources.\nAssessment: The capacity realism view deserves more weight than it typically receives. Accountability frameworks assume capacity that many states demonstrably lack. Federal requirements should either be calibrated to capacity or accompanied by capacity-building investment. Requiring outputs that states cannot produce generates compliance fiction without improving implementation.\nThe Federalism Critique The argument: CMS micromanagement undermines state innovation and capacity. NOFO requirements, reporting mandates, and approval processes consume state capacity that should serve implementation. Federal oversight designed for fraud prevention actively hinders transformation.\nEvidence supporting: Compliance burden is substantial and documented. Approval delays impede implementation timelines. Technical assistance sometimes functions as surveillance. States with more federal flexibility report better implementation experiences.\nEvidence against: States given flexibility have sometimes misused it. Some federal requirements address legitimate accountability concerns. Complete federal withdrawal would enable problematic state behavior.\nAssessment: The federalism critique has substantial validity that federal officials underweight. Federal oversight designed to prevent fraud actively hinders transformation. This does not mean oversight is unnecessary, but current oversight intensity and uniformity impose costs that exceed benefits. Thoughtful federal engagement that enables transformation rather than obstructing it is possible but not current practice.\nThe Community Accountability Gap The argument: State agencies answer to CMS and governors, not communities. Rural residents have no voice in implementation decisions affecting their lives. Stakeholder engagement is performative rather than substantive. Transformation requires community accountability that current structures do not provide.\nEvidence supporting: Advisory committees predominantly include providers and professionals rather than community residents. Community input, when solicited, rarely changes decisions. No state RHTP application includes meaningful community authority over implementation.\nEvidence against: Some states have created community engagement that appears genuine. Community members may lack technical expertise for program decisions. Democratic accountability to governors theoretically represents community interests.\nAssessment: The community accountability gap is real and consequential. Current stakeholder engagement predominantly performs inclusion rather than practicing it. Whether this matters depends on whether community perspective would improve implementation. Evidence from other programs suggests community authority improves relevance and sustainability. RHTP’s failure to require meaningful community power represents a design limitation that states could address but have not.\nThe Transformation Impossibility View The argument: State agencies are built to administer programs, not transform systems. Transformation requires challenging incumbent providers, disrupting existing arrangements, and accepting short-term pain for long-term gain. Bureaucracies cannot do this. Expecting transformation from agencies designed for stability is misguided.\nEvidence supporting: State agencies have historically maintained provider relationships rather than disrupting them. Transformation rhetoric in RHTP applications is not matched by transformation strategy. Agency incentives favor stability over disruption.\nEvidence against: Some agencies have demonstrated transformation capacity, particularly with sustained leadership and political support. Agency design does not deterministically constrain agency behavior.\nAssessment: The transformation impossibility view overstates the constraint while identifying a genuine tendency. State agencies default to stability because stability is safer for agency leaders. Transformation requires political cover that enables agency staff to make disruptive decisions without career consequences. Where governors provide this cover, transformation becomes possible. Where they do not, agencies rationally pursue stability. The constraint is political, not structural.\nPart IV: What Determines Success If structures predict outcomes poorly, what does predict outcomes? Series 5 findings suggest several factors that matter more than organizational design.\nLeadership Focus States where implementation succeeds typically have leaders, whether governors, agency directors, or program administrators, who make RHTP a genuine priority rather than one program among many. Leadership focus is not a structural characteristic. It cannot be required by NOFO. It cannot be assessed from organizational charts. But its presence or absence shapes implementation more than authority alignment or coordination structures.\nThe Montana vignette from Article 5E illustrates this pattern. Montana’s rapid response to hospital closure reflected leadership focus on problem-solving. The project officer received a call the day after the announcement. Three options were outlined immediately. Implementation began before formal paperwork completed. This response required leadership attention that structural analysis cannot capture.\nRelationship Quality Federal-state relationships vary from collaborative to adversarial. The same federal requirements produce dramatically different experiences depending on relationship context. Collaborative relationships transform compliance into support. Adversarial relationships transform technical assistance into surveillance.\nRelationship quality is not structural. It emerges from personal interactions, accumulated trust, and track records of reliability. States cannot create collaborative relationships through organizational change. They must build them through consistent behavior over time. This takes longer than RHTP’s five-year timeline, which means states enter implementation with relationship legacies that shape their experience regardless of structural choices.\nPrior Investment States that invested in rural health infrastructure before RHTP have capacity that newcomers lack. Established rural health offices have staff with expertise. Prior telehealth programs created platforms. Previous workforce initiatives developed relationships with training programs. RHTP amplifies existing capacity rather than creating it from nothing.\nPrior investment is not structural. It reflects historical policy choices and accumulated capacity that current organizational design cannot replicate. States without prior investment face a cold start that RHTP funding alone cannot overcome. Series 3 state profiles documented this pattern: states with substantial existing programs proposed sophisticated expansion while states without prior investment proposed capacity building that will consume most of their RHTP timeline.\nPolitical Commitment Implementation requires decisions that create political costs. Closing struggling hospitals serves transformation but harms affected communities. Redirecting funds from incumbent providers to new models threatens established interests. Requiring accountability from powerful organizations invites pushback.\nPolitical commitment determines whether agencies can make costly decisions. Governors who provide political cover enable transformation. Governors who distance themselves from controversy constrain agency action. This political context shapes implementation more than organizational design. States with identical structures but different political contexts produce different outcomes because political commitment, not structure, is the binding constraint.\nPart V: Implications for RHTP For State Agencies Ensure authority aligns with accountability, or negotiate realistic expectations. Lead agencies held accountable for outcomes they cannot control should either acquire necessary authority or negotiate modified accountability with CMS. Accepting accountability without authority produces failure that harms careers and communities.\nInvest in relationship infrastructure. Federal relationships, provider partnerships, and community connections matter more than organizational optimization. States should treat relationship building as implementation infrastructure, dedicating staff time and leadership attention to cultivation that formal processes cannot replace.\nBuild capacity before deploying programs. States lacking procurement staff, evaluation expertise, or program management capacity should use early RHTP funding for capacity building rather than rushing to program implementation. Implementation failures in Year 2 cost more than capacity investment in Year 1.\nCreate learning orientation, not just compliance systems. Measurement that informs improvement differs from measurement that satisfies requirements. States should invest in evaluation capacity that enables strategic adjustment rather than merely producing required reports.\nPursue meaningful community engagement or do not pretend. Stakeholder coordination that does not influence decisions wastes everyone’s time. States should either create genuine community authority or acknowledge that decisions will be made without community input. The pretense of inclusion without its practice generates cynicism that undermines future engagement.\nFor CMS Differentiate oversight by capacity and relationship quality. Uniform oversight wastes federal resources on states that need minimal engagement while providing insufficient support to states that need intensive assistance. Risk-based oversight that concentrates attention where it is most needed would improve both federal efficiency and state outcomes.\nReduce compliance burden where it does not serve accountability. Current requirements assume state capacity that frequently does not exist. Streamlining requirements would improve measurement quality by enabling states to focus on fewer metrics. Federal officials should honestly assess which requirements serve transformation versus which serve bureaucratic habit.\nRecognize authority gaps when assigning accountability. Holding lead agencies accountable for outcomes they cannot control produces documentation fiction rather than improved implementation. CMS should assess actual authority distribution and calibrate expectations accordingly. Where authority is genuinely distributed, accountability should be distributed as well.\nInvest in state capacity as legitimate federal interest. If sophisticated implementation requires capacity that states lack, capacity building is legitimate RHTP investment. States should be encouraged to use RHTP funds for staff development, technical infrastructure, and evaluation systems that enable meaningful implementation.\nAccept that relationship quality matters. Project officer assignments, communication patterns, and technical assistance approaches shape state experience. Federal officials should recognize that identical processes function differently depending on relationship context and invest in relationship building that compliance orientation neglects.\nFor Evaluators and Observers Assess actual authority, not formal designation. Organizational charts mislead. Evaluation should examine who actually makes decisions, not who should make decisions based on formal structure. Authority mapping that identifies decision-makers regardless of title provides more useful assessment than organizational analysis.\nTrack relationship quality as implementation predictor. States with collaborative federal relationships and functional internal coordination outperform states with adversarial relationships regardless of formal structure. Evaluation should include relationship assessment as a predictor of implementation success.\nDistinguish compliance from performance. States that produce sophisticated reports may be gaming metrics rather than achieving outcomes. States with messy documentation may be prioritizing implementation over paperwork. Evaluation should examine substance rather than documentation quality, recognizing that compliance capacity and implementation capacity are distinct.\nInclude community voice assessment. Transformation that communities did not request and do not support rarely produces lasting change. Evaluation should assess whether community members influenced decisions, not merely whether they were consulted.\nAcknowledge uncertainty and information limits. The gap between formal and actual practice means evaluators often cannot know what actually occurred. Assessments should acknowledge where information is unreliable rather than treating documented processes as verified reality.\nPart VI: The Honest Assessment What Structures Can Do Organizational structures create possibilities and constraints. Clear authority alignment reduces coordination costs. Streamlined procurement enables timely execution. Sophisticated measurement supports strategic adjustment. Collaborative stakeholder processes generate stakeholder commitment.\nStructures can remove obstacles. When procurement rules impede implementation, streamlined processes remove the obstacle. When authority fragmentation creates confusion, consolidated authority clarifies responsibility. When stakeholder exclusion generates resistance, inclusive processes reduce opposition.\nStructures cannot create capacity. Organizational change does not produce qualified staff, technical expertise, or implementation experience. States lacking capacity will continue lacking capacity regardless of structural optimization. Structures that assume capacity not present will fail regardless of elegance.\nStructures cannot substitute for leadership. Organizational design cannot make governors prioritize rural health. Authority alignment cannot make agency directors focus on RHTP. Coordination mechanisms cannot produce coordination when participants lack incentive to coordinate. Leadership attention is prerequisite; structure is facilitation.\nStructures cannot guarantee relationships. Federal-state relationships depend on personal interactions that organizational design cannot mandate. Provider partnerships require trust that formal agreements cannot create. Community engagement requires authenticity that documented processes cannot ensure.\nWhat This Means for RHTP RHTP operates within state agency structures that vary dramatically. Some states have aligned authority, sophisticated capacity, collaborative relationships, and committed leadership. These states will likely implement effectively regardless of RHTP design.\nOther states have fragmented authority, limited capacity, adversarial relationships, and distracted leadership. These states will likely struggle regardless of federal requirements. RHTP can provide resources, but it cannot provide the conditions that enable resource use. The gap between strong and weak implementers will likely persist or widen.\nThe honest assessment is not that structures do not matter. They matter, but they matter less than advocates of organizational reform assume. Leadership, relationships, capacity, and political commitment matter more. States seeking to improve implementation should focus on these factors rather than reorganization that consumes attention without addressing fundamental constraints.\nThe Transition to Providers and Communities Series 5 examined state agencies as implementers. The analysis revealed that agency structures shape but do not determine implementation outcomes. Leadership, relationships, capacity, and politics matter at least as much as organizational design.\nBut state agencies are only one layer in implementation. Between state agencies and rural residents stand intermediary organizations: hospital associations, FQHC networks, AHECs, public health coalitions, and multi-stakeholder collaboratives. These organizations aggregate, translate, and sometimes capture the resources that flow from states to communities.\nSeries 6 examines these intermediaries with the same analytical orientation: not cataloging organizations but assessing whether they strengthen or weaken transformation, whether their contribution exceeds their cost, whether the aggregation and translation they provide justify the opacity and potential capture they create.\nThe question is not merely descriptive. States that rely heavily on intermediaries face different implementation dynamics than states that contract directly with providers. Understanding which model serves transformation, and under what conditions, matters for state strategy and federal oversight.\nRosa still brings groceries from her own kitchen. The referrals still remain open in the system. The navigation model still assumes resources that do not exist. State agencies design programs; intermediaries distribute resources; providers deliver services.

</div>

<p>The organizational chart shows the Department of Health as lead agency. The Governor&rsquo;s office makes the decisions. The organizational chart shows stakeholder coordination through a formal advisory committee. The hospital association lobbyist makes the calls that matter. The organizational chart shows clear lines of authority. Reality reveals authority so distributed that no one can act decisively.</p>
<p><strong>State agency structures are supposed to shape implementation outcomes.</strong> This assumption underlies CMS requirements, state planning, and federal accountability mechanisms. Series 5 examined this assumption across five domains: lead agency authority, stakeholder coordination, procurement processes, performance measurement, and federal relationships. The evidence suggests the assumption is partially correct but fundamentally incomplete.</p>
<p>Agency structures matter, but <strong>they matter less than how those structures function in practice, less than the relationships that animate them, and less than the political context that constrains them</strong>. States with identical organizational models produce dramatically different results. States with problematic structures sometimes outperform states with aligned authority. The explanation lies not in charts and procedures but in leadership focus, relationship quality, and political commitment that no organizational design can guarantee.</p>
<p>This synthesis integrates findings across Series 5 to address the core question: do state agency structures determine implementation success, or do other factors matter more? The answer matters because it shapes where improvement efforts should focus. If structures determine outcomes, restructuring should precede implementation. If other factors dominate, restructuring wastes time that should go to relationship building, capacity development, and political cultivation.</p>

<h3 id="the-five-domains">The Five Domains<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-five-domains">#</a></h3>
<p>Series 5 examined state agency functions through fundamental tensions that every state must navigate regardless of organizational design.</p>
<p><strong>5A: Lead Agency Structures</strong> examined the gap between formal accountability and actual authority. CMS requires governors to designate single lead agencies, creating accountability that organizational charts display but reality frequently undermines. Lead agencies responsible for implementation often lack control over the resources, decisions, and coordination required to implement. The finding matters because CMS holds agencies accountable for outcomes they cannot control, while actual decision-makers face no federal oversight.</p>
<p><strong>5B: Stakeholder Coordination</strong> examined the tension between centralized efficiency and distributed knowledge. Federal requirements mandate stakeholder engagement. States document committees, meetings, and participation. But advisory committees meet while they do not govern; communities participate while they do not decide. Coordination structures predominantly create appearance of distributed input while concentrating actual authority at state agencies.</p>
<p><strong>5C: Procurement and Contracting</strong> examined the tension between process compliance and outcome achievement. State procurement regulations protect against fraud and favoritism. They also impede transformation timelines. States cannot recruit subawardees, select vendors, or execute contracts at the speed RHTP implementation requires. The process compliance that protects integrity actively undermines performance.</p>
<p><strong>5D: Performance Measurement</strong> examined the tension between accountability demands and capacity limitations. CMS requires sophisticated measurement systems. Many state agencies lack capacity to produce meaningful data. The result is compliance theater: reports that satisfy requirements without enabling learning. States optimize for metrics rather than outcomes, producing measurement that performs accountability rather than informing improvement.</p>
<p><strong>5E: Federal-State Relationship</strong> examined the tension between federal mandate and state autonomy. RHTP uses cooperative agreement language implying partnership. Reality involves federal mandates, state compliance, and contested authority. Relationship quality varies dramatically across states, and those relationships, not federal requirements, determine whether the same processes enable or obstruct implementation.</p>
<h3 id="patterns-across-domains">Patterns Across Domains<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#patterns-across-domains">#</a></h3>
<p>The five articles reveal consistent patterns that transcend any single function.</p>
<p><strong>Pattern 1: Formal structures predict little.</strong> States with aligned formal authority sometimes underperform states with fragmented authority. States with comprehensive stakeholder structures sometimes produce worse community engagement than states with minimal formal processes. The gap between what organizational charts show and what actually happens is large and consequential.</p>
<p><strong>Pattern 2: Relationships matter more than structures.</strong> A collaborative CMS relationship transforms compliance burden into implementation support. A functional relationship between the lead agency director and governor&rsquo;s health advisor enables authority exercise that no organizational chart can capture. Personal trust between state officials and provider associations accelerates stakeholder coordination beyond what formal processes accomplish.</p>
<p><strong>Pattern 3: Capacity constrains everything.</strong> States lacking procurement staff cannot execute timely contracts regardless of streamlined processes. States lacking evaluation expertise cannot produce meaningful measurement regardless of federal requirements. States lacking qualified personnel cannot implement programs regardless of available funding. Capacity is the rate-limiting factor that structural optimization cannot address.</p>
<p><strong>Pattern 4: Political context shapes agency behavior.</strong> Agencies serve governors who face electoral incentives. Rural health competes with other priorities for gubernatorial attention. Legislative budget processes constrain agency discretion. Provider interests exercise political influence that shapes what agencies can accomplish. Structural analysis that ignores political economy produces naive recommendations.</p>
<p><strong>Pattern 5: The appearance of compliance substitutes for substance.</strong> States document stakeholder engagement while stakeholders do not influence decisions. States report performance metrics while metrics do not inform strategy. States create coordination structures while coordination does not occur. The gap between documentation and practice is systematic, not exceptional.</p>
<h2 id="part-ii-the-fundamental-tensions-revisited">Part II: The Fundamental Tensions Revisited<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#part-ii-the-fundamental-tensions-revisited">#</a></h2>
<p>Series 5 identified five fundamental tensions that every state navigates. Synthesis requires assessing which approaches to these tensions the evidence supports.</p>
<h3 id="tension-1-federal-mandate-vs-state-autonomy">Tension 1: Federal Mandate vs. State Autonomy<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#tension-1-federal-mandate-vs-state-autonomy">#</a></h3>
<p>The federal view emphasizes accountability. CMS holds $50 billion in public funds. Congressional appropriators and GAO auditors will scrutinize every dollar. Without federal requirements, states will underperform, misspend, or direct funds to incumbent providers without demanding change.</p>
<p>The state view emphasizes flexibility. Rural health challenges vary dramatically across states. Rigid federal requirements force states into ill-fitting templates. States understand local conditions better than CMS. Micromanagement consumes capacity that should serve implementation.</p>
<p><strong>What the evidence supports:</strong> Both views have merit. Federal requirements have prevented misuse in some contexts. Federal rigidity has hindered transformation in others. The evidence does not support either pure federal control or pure state autonomy. It supports <strong>differentiated oversight</strong> based on state capacity and relationship quality. High-capacity states with collaborative relationships can function with lighter federal touch. Low-capacity states with adversarial relationships may require more intensive engagement, though that engagement should enable rather than merely monitor.</p>
<h3 id="tension-2-capacity-vs-accountability">Tension 2: Capacity vs. Accountability<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#tension-2-capacity-vs-accountability">#</a></h3>
<p>The accountability view holds that federal funds require accountability. States that cannot perform should not receive funds. Requirements should be uniform because differential treatment invites gaming.</p>
<p>The capacity realism view holds that demanding sophisticated performance from under-resourced agencies is pointless. Low-capacity states cannot meet requirements regardless of mandates. Requirements that exceed capacity produce compliance theater rather than meaningful accountability.</p>
<p><strong>What the evidence supports:</strong> The capacity realism view has substantial merit that accountability frameworks underweight. States cannot produce capacity they lack because CMS requires it. Requirements that exceed state capacity generate documentation fiction, not improved implementation. The evidence supports <strong>capacity-appropriate accountability</strong>: simpler requirements for states with limited capacity, with federal investment in capacity building as a legitimate RHTP use.</p>
<h3 id="tension-3-formal-authority-vs-actual-practice">Tension 3: Formal Authority vs. Actual Practice<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#tension-3-formal-authority-vs-actual-practice">#</a></h3>
<p>The formal authority view assumes organizational charts reflect reality. Designating a lead agency creates accountability. Establishing coordination structures produces coordination. Requiring measurement generates data.</p>
<p>The actual practice view observes that designated authority frequently diverges from decision authority. Governors make decisions regardless of which agency holds cooperative agreements. Informal relationships shape outcomes that formal processes cannot capture. Authority accumulates with tenure, relationships, and political capital rather than organizational designation.</p>
<p><strong>What the evidence supports:</strong> The actual practice view dominates. Lead agencies frequently cannot control what they are held accountable for. Stakeholder coordination structures predominantly create appearance rather than substance. Procurement processes serve compliance more than outcomes. <strong>The gap between formal and actual authority is large, systematic, and consequential for implementation.</strong> CMS monitoring that assumes formal authority reflects reality produces misleading assessments.</p>
<h3 id="tension-4-centralized-control-vs-local-knowledge">Tension 4: Centralized Control vs. Local Knowledge<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#tension-4-centralized-control-vs-local-knowledge">#</a></h3>
<p>The centralized control view emphasizes efficiency. State agencies can standardize approaches, aggregate purchasing power, ensure equity across regions, and maintain accountability that distributed implementation cannot achieve.</p>
<p>The local knowledge view emphasizes effectiveness. Rural communities vary dramatically. State agencies cannot understand local contexts. Effective implementation requires community authority to adapt strategies to local circumstances. Centralized control produces uniform approaches that fit nowhere well.</p>
<p><strong>What the evidence supports:</strong> Neither extreme performs well. Pure centralization ignores local variation that matters. Pure decentralization fragments accountability and enables capture by local interests. The evidence supports <strong>structured flexibility</strong>: state frameworks that enable local adaptation within defined parameters, with accountability for outcomes rather than process compliance. This middle path requires more sophisticated state capacity than either extreme.</p>
<h3 id="tension-5-process-compliance-vs-outcome-achievement">Tension 5: Process Compliance vs. Outcome Achievement<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#tension-5-process-compliance-vs-outcome-achievement">#</a></h3>
<p>The process compliance view emphasizes integrity. Procurement rules prevent corruption. Measurement requirements ensure accountability. Documentation creates audit trails. Without process compliance, programs invite fraud and favoritism.</p>
<p>The outcome achievement view emphasizes results. Rigid processes impede implementation. Compliance burden consumes capacity that should serve communities. Procurement timelines that protect integrity undermine performance. Measurement that satisfies requirements without informing decisions wastes resources.</p>
<p><strong>What the evidence supports:</strong> Process compliance has value that outcome enthusiasts underweight, particularly in states with histories of misuse. But current compliance requirements in many states substantially exceed what integrity protection requires. <strong>The evidence supports streamlined processes that maintain essential safeguards while enabling implementation speed.</strong> States that have achieved this balance outperform states locked in compliance rigidity.</p>
<h2 id="part-iii-the-alternative-perspectives-assessed">Part III: The Alternative Perspectives Assessed<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#part-iii-the-alternative-perspectives-assessed">#</a></h2>
<p>Series 5 surfaced several alternative perspectives that challenge conventional assumptions about state agency implementation.</p>
<h3 id="the-political-economy-view">The Political Economy View<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-political-economy-view">#</a></h3>
<p><em>The argument:</em> State agency decisions reflect political incentives, not optimal implementation. Governors reward allies. Agencies protect turf. Procurement favors connected vendors. Understanding implementation requires analyzing political dynamics rather than assuming rational bureaucratic behavior.</p>
<p><em>Evidence supporting:</em> Subaward patterns in many states correlate with political relationships. Lead agency designations reflect gubernatorial staffing preferences as much as functional logic. Advisory committee appointments favor politically connected organizations.</p>
<p><em>Evidence against:</em> Some states demonstrate genuine evidence-based decision-making. Political incentives sometimes align with effective implementation. Not all political considerations undermine program goals.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment:</strong> The political economy view has substantial explanatory power. Structural analysis that ignores political context produces recommendations that assume incentives not present in practice. <strong>Effective implementation requires either aligning political incentives with program goals or insulating implementation from political interference.</strong> Neither is easy, but pretending politics does not shape agency behavior guarantees naive analysis.</p>
<h3 id="the-capacity-realism-view">The Capacity Realism View<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-capacity-realism-view">#</a></h3>
<p><em>The argument:</em> Demanding sophisticated implementation from under-resourced agencies is pointless. Many state rural health offices have fewer than ten staff members administering programs serving millions of residents. Complex federal requirements overwhelm limited capacity.</p>
<p><em>Evidence supporting:</em> Low-capacity states produce lower-quality implementation across every function examined. Compliance burden falls disproportionately on states least able to bear it. Some states cannot execute basic procurement within RHTP timelines regardless of streamlined processes.</p>
<p><em>Evidence against:</em> Some low-resource states outperform better-resourced peers through focused priorities and effective leadership. Capacity is not purely a function of resources.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment:</strong> The capacity realism view deserves more weight than it typically receives. <strong>Accountability frameworks assume capacity that many states demonstrably lack.</strong> Federal requirements should either be calibrated to capacity or accompanied by capacity-building investment. Requiring outputs that states cannot produce generates compliance fiction without improving implementation.</p>
<h3 id="the-federalism-critique">The Federalism Critique<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-federalism-critique">#</a></h3>
<p><em>The argument:</em> CMS micromanagement undermines state innovation and capacity. NOFO requirements, reporting mandates, and approval processes consume state capacity that should serve implementation. Federal oversight designed for fraud prevention actively hinders transformation.</p>
<p><em>Evidence supporting:</em> Compliance burden is substantial and documented. Approval delays impede implementation timelines. Technical assistance sometimes functions as surveillance. States with more federal flexibility report better implementation experiences.</p>
<p><em>Evidence against:</em> States given flexibility have sometimes misused it. Some federal requirements address legitimate accountability concerns. Complete federal withdrawal would enable problematic state behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment:</strong> The federalism critique has substantial validity that federal officials underweight. <strong>Federal oversight designed to prevent fraud actively hinders transformation.</strong> This does not mean oversight is unnecessary, but current oversight intensity and uniformity impose costs that exceed benefits. Thoughtful federal engagement that enables transformation rather than obstructing it is possible but not current practice.</p>
<h3 id="the-community-accountability-gap">The Community Accountability Gap<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-community-accountability-gap">#</a></h3>
<p><em>The argument:</em> State agencies answer to CMS and governors, not communities. Rural residents have no voice in implementation decisions affecting their lives. Stakeholder engagement is performative rather than substantive. Transformation requires community accountability that current structures do not provide.</p>
<p><em>Evidence supporting:</em> Advisory committees predominantly include providers and professionals rather than community residents. Community input, when solicited, rarely changes decisions. No state RHTP application includes meaningful community authority over implementation.</p>
<p><em>Evidence against:</em> Some states have created community engagement that appears genuine. Community members may lack technical expertise for program decisions. Democratic accountability to governors theoretically represents community interests.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment:</strong> The community accountability gap is real and consequential. <strong>Current stakeholder engagement predominantly performs inclusion rather than practicing it.</strong> Whether this matters depends on whether community perspective would improve implementation. Evidence from other programs suggests community authority improves relevance and sustainability. RHTP&rsquo;s failure to require meaningful community power represents a design limitation that states could address but have not.</p>
<h3 id="the-transformation-impossibility-view">The Transformation Impossibility View<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-transformation-impossibility-view">#</a></h3>
<p><em>The argument:</em> State agencies are built to administer programs, not transform systems. Transformation requires challenging incumbent providers, disrupting existing arrangements, and accepting short-term pain for long-term gain. Bureaucracies cannot do this. Expecting transformation from agencies designed for stability is misguided.</p>
<p><em>Evidence supporting:</em> State agencies have historically maintained provider relationships rather than disrupting them. Transformation rhetoric in RHTP applications is not matched by transformation strategy. Agency incentives favor stability over disruption.</p>
<p><em>Evidence against:</em> Some agencies have demonstrated transformation capacity, particularly with sustained leadership and political support. Agency design does not deterministically constrain agency behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment:</strong> The transformation impossibility view overstates the constraint while identifying a genuine tendency. <strong>State agencies default to stability because stability is safer for agency leaders.</strong> Transformation requires political cover that enables agency staff to make disruptive decisions without career consequences. Where governors provide this cover, transformation becomes possible. Where they do not, agencies rationally pursue stability. The constraint is political, not structural.</p>
<h2 id="part-iv-what-determines-success">Part IV: What Determines Success<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#part-iv-what-determines-success">#</a></h2>
<p>If structures predict outcomes poorly, what does predict outcomes? Series 5 findings suggest several factors that matter more than organizational design.</p>
<h3 id="leadership-focus">Leadership Focus<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#leadership-focus">#</a></h3>
<p>States where implementation succeeds typically have leaders, whether governors, agency directors, or program administrators, who make RHTP a genuine priority rather than one program among many. <strong>Leadership focus is not a structural characteristic.</strong> It cannot be required by NOFO. It cannot be assessed from organizational charts. But its presence or absence shapes implementation more than authority alignment or coordination structures.</p>
<p>The Montana vignette from Article 5E illustrates this pattern. Montana&rsquo;s rapid response to hospital closure reflected leadership focus on problem-solving. The project officer received a call the day after the announcement. Three options were outlined immediately. Implementation began before formal paperwork completed. This response required leadership attention that structural analysis cannot capture.</p>
<h3 id="relationship-quality">Relationship Quality<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#relationship-quality">#</a></h3>
<p>Federal-state relationships vary from collaborative to adversarial. The same federal requirements produce dramatically different experiences depending on relationship context. Collaborative relationships transform compliance into support. Adversarial relationships transform technical assistance into surveillance.</p>
<p><strong>Relationship quality is not structural.</strong> It emerges from personal interactions, accumulated trust, and track records of reliability. States cannot create collaborative relationships through organizational change. They must build them through consistent behavior over time. This takes longer than RHTP&rsquo;s five-year timeline, which means states enter implementation with relationship legacies that shape their experience regardless of structural choices.</p>
<h3 id="prior-investment">Prior Investment<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#prior-investment">#</a></h3>
<p>States that invested in rural health infrastructure before RHTP have capacity that newcomers lack. Established rural health offices have staff with expertise. Prior telehealth programs created platforms. Previous workforce initiatives developed relationships with training programs. RHTP amplifies existing capacity rather than creating it from nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Prior investment is not structural.</strong> It reflects historical policy choices and accumulated capacity that current organizational design cannot replicate. States without prior investment face a cold start that RHTP funding alone cannot overcome. Series 3 state profiles documented this pattern: states with substantial existing programs proposed sophisticated expansion while states without prior investment proposed capacity building that will consume most of their RHTP timeline.</p>
<h3 id="political-commitment">Political Commitment<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#political-commitment">#</a></h3>
<p>Implementation requires decisions that create political costs. Closing struggling hospitals serves transformation but harms affected communities. Redirecting funds from incumbent providers to new models threatens established interests. Requiring accountability from powerful organizations invites pushback.</p>
<p><strong>Political commitment determines whether agencies can make costly decisions.</strong> Governors who provide political cover enable transformation. Governors who distance themselves from controversy constrain agency action. This political context shapes implementation more than organizational design. States with identical structures but different political contexts produce different outcomes because political commitment, not structure, is the binding constraint.</p>
<h2 id="part-v-implications-for-rhtp">Part V: Implications for RHTP<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#part-v-implications-for-rhtp">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="for-state-agencies">For State Agencies<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#for-state-agencies">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Ensure authority aligns with accountability, or negotiate realistic expectations.</strong> Lead agencies held accountable for outcomes they cannot control should either acquire necessary authority or negotiate modified accountability with CMS. Accepting accountability without authority produces failure that harms careers and communities.</p>
<p><strong>Invest in relationship infrastructure.</strong> Federal relationships, provider partnerships, and community connections matter more than organizational optimization. States should treat relationship building as implementation infrastructure, dedicating staff time and leadership attention to cultivation that formal processes cannot replace.</p>
<p><strong>Build capacity before deploying programs.</strong> States lacking procurement staff, evaluation expertise, or program management capacity should use early RHTP funding for capacity building rather than rushing to program implementation. Implementation failures in Year 2 cost more than capacity investment in Year 1.</p>
<p><strong>Create learning orientation, not just compliance systems.</strong> Measurement that informs improvement differs from measurement that satisfies requirements. States should invest in evaluation capacity that enables strategic adjustment rather than merely producing required reports.</p>
<p><strong>Pursue meaningful community engagement or do not pretend.</strong> Stakeholder coordination that does not influence decisions wastes everyone&rsquo;s time. States should either create genuine community authority or acknowledge that decisions will be made without community input. The pretense of inclusion without its practice generates cynicism that undermines future engagement.</p>
<h3 id="for-cms">For CMS<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#for-cms">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Differentiate oversight by capacity and relationship quality.</strong> Uniform oversight wastes federal resources on states that need minimal engagement while providing insufficient support to states that need intensive assistance. Risk-based oversight that concentrates attention where it is most needed would improve both federal efficiency and state outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Reduce compliance burden where it does not serve accountability.</strong> Current requirements assume state capacity that frequently does not exist. Streamlining requirements would improve measurement quality by enabling states to focus on fewer metrics. Federal officials should honestly assess which requirements serve transformation versus which serve bureaucratic habit.</p>
<p><strong>Recognize authority gaps when assigning accountability.</strong> Holding lead agencies accountable for outcomes they cannot control produces documentation fiction rather than improved implementation. CMS should assess actual authority distribution and calibrate expectations accordingly. Where authority is genuinely distributed, accountability should be distributed as well.</p>
<p><strong>Invest in state capacity as legitimate federal interest.</strong> If sophisticated implementation requires capacity that states lack, capacity building is legitimate RHTP investment. States should be encouraged to use RHTP funds for staff development, technical infrastructure, and evaluation systems that enable meaningful implementation.</p>
<p><strong>Accept that relationship quality matters.</strong> Project officer assignments, communication patterns, and technical assistance approaches shape state experience. Federal officials should recognize that identical processes function differently depending on relationship context and invest in relationship building that compliance orientation neglects.</p>
<h3 id="for-evaluators-and-observers">For Evaluators and Observers<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#for-evaluators-and-observers">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Assess actual authority, not formal designation.</strong> Organizational charts mislead. Evaluation should examine who actually makes decisions, not who should make decisions based on formal structure. Authority mapping that identifies decision-makers regardless of title provides more useful assessment than organizational analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Track relationship quality as implementation predictor.</strong> States with collaborative federal relationships and functional internal coordination outperform states with adversarial relationships regardless of formal structure. Evaluation should include relationship assessment as a predictor of implementation success.</p>
<p><strong>Distinguish compliance from performance.</strong> States that produce sophisticated reports may be gaming metrics rather than achieving outcomes. States with messy documentation may be prioritizing implementation over paperwork. Evaluation should examine substance rather than documentation quality, recognizing that compliance capacity and implementation capacity are distinct.</p>
<p><strong>Include community voice assessment.</strong> Transformation that communities did not request and do not support rarely produces lasting change. Evaluation should assess whether community members influenced decisions, not merely whether they were consulted.</p>
<p><strong>Acknowledge uncertainty and information limits.</strong> The gap between formal and actual practice means evaluators often cannot know what actually occurred. Assessments should acknowledge where information is unreliable rather than treating documented processes as verified reality.</p>
<h2 id="part-vi-the-honest-assessment">Part VI: The Honest Assessment<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#part-vi-the-honest-assessment">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="what-structures-can-do">What Structures Can Do<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-structures-can-do">#</a></h3>
<p>Organizational structures create possibilities and constraints. Clear authority alignment reduces coordination costs. Streamlined procurement enables timely execution. Sophisticated measurement supports strategic adjustment. Collaborative stakeholder processes generate stakeholder commitment.</p>
<p><strong>Structures can remove obstacles.</strong> When procurement rules impede implementation, streamlined processes remove the obstacle. When authority fragmentation creates confusion, consolidated authority clarifies responsibility. When stakeholder exclusion generates resistance, inclusive processes reduce opposition.</p>
<p><strong>Structures cannot create capacity.</strong> Organizational change does not produce qualified staff, technical expertise, or implementation experience. States lacking capacity will continue lacking capacity regardless of structural optimization. Structures that assume capacity not present will fail regardless of elegance.</p>
<p><strong>Structures cannot substitute for leadership.</strong> Organizational design cannot make governors prioritize rural health. Authority alignment cannot make agency directors focus on RHTP. Coordination mechanisms cannot produce coordination when participants lack incentive to coordinate. Leadership attention is prerequisite; structure is facilitation.</p>
<p><strong>Structures cannot guarantee relationships.</strong> Federal-state relationships depend on personal interactions that organizational design cannot mandate. Provider partnerships require trust that formal agreements cannot create. Community engagement requires authenticity that documented processes cannot ensure.</p>
<h3 id="what-this-means-for-rhtp">What This Means for RHTP<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-this-means-for-rhtp">#</a></h3>
<p>RHTP operates within state agency structures that vary dramatically. Some states have aligned authority, sophisticated capacity, collaborative relationships, and committed leadership. These states will likely implement effectively regardless of RHTP design.</p>
<p>Other states have fragmented authority, limited capacity, adversarial relationships, and distracted leadership. <strong>These states will likely struggle regardless of federal requirements.</strong> RHTP can provide resources, but it cannot provide the conditions that enable resource use. The gap between strong and weak implementers will likely persist or widen.</p>
<p>The honest assessment is not that structures do not matter. They matter, but they matter less than advocates of organizational reform assume. <strong>Leadership, relationships, capacity, and political commitment matter more.</strong> States seeking to improve implementation should focus on these factors rather than reorganization that consumes attention without addressing fundamental constraints.</p>
<h3 id="the-transition-to-providers-and-communities">The Transition to Providers and Communities<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-transition-to-providers-and-communities">#</a></h3>
<p>Series 5 examined state agencies as implementers. The analysis revealed that agency structures shape but do not determine implementation outcomes. Leadership, relationships, capacity, and politics matter at least as much as organizational design.</p>
<p>But state agencies are only one layer in implementation. Between state agencies and rural residents stand <strong>intermediary organizations</strong>: hospital associations, FQHC networks, AHECs, public health coalitions, and multi-stakeholder collaboratives. These organizations aggregate, translate, and sometimes capture the resources that flow from states to communities.</p>
<p>Series 6 examines these intermediaries with the same analytical orientation: not cataloging organizations but assessing whether they strengthen or weaken transformation, whether their contribution exceeds their cost, whether the aggregation and translation they provide justify the opacity and potential capture they create.</p>
<p>The question is not merely descriptive. States that rely heavily on intermediaries face different implementation dynamics than states that contract directly with providers. Understanding which model serves transformation, and under what conditions, matters for state strategy and federal oversight.</p>
<p>Rosa still brings groceries from her own kitchen. The referrals still remain open in the system. The navigation model still assumes resources that do not exist. State agencies design programs; intermediaries distribute resources; providers deliver services. Somewhere in this chain, the gap between documented coordination and actual food in Maria&rsquo;s kitchen persists.</p>
<p>Series 6 examines the intermediary layer to understand its contribution to that gap.</p>
