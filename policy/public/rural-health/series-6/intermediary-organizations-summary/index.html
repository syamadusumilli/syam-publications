  "articleBody": "The Rural Health Transformation Program assumes intermediaries add value to implementation, but this assumption warrants scrutiny. State agencies lack the capacity to maintain relationships with thousands of Critical Access Hospitals, FQHCs, and rural clinics while simultaneously developing specialized expertise in workforce development, health information exchange, and population health management. Intermediaries theoretically fill these gaps by aggregating providers, coordinating activities, and translating policy into practice. However, overhead absorbs resources that could otherwise reach providers and communities, organizational interests may diverge from transformation goals, and accountability becomes diffuse when funding flows through multiple layers. The question confronting RHTP implementation is not whether intermediaries matter but whether their contribution exceeds their cost.\nAnalysis of six intermediary types reveals a consistent pattern: value is conditional rather than inherent. No intermediary category uniformly helps or hinders transformation. Hospital associations add value when transformation strengthens member hospitals through network development and shared services, but they subtract value when transformation requires member closure, conversion, or market share loss. The TORCH network in Texas demonstrates value-add through peer learning and network coordination, while associations that protect member hospitals that should convert to Rural Emergency Hospitals demonstrate value extraction. FQHCs and Primary Care Associations add value when their legitimacy with safety-net providers enables honest engagement about difficult transformation, but they subtract value when legitimacy masks capacity limitations. Colorado’s CCHN demonstrates value through sophisticated community health worker training programs, while PCAs receiving subawards exceeding their organizational capacity demonstrate risk.\nRegional Health Information Organizations add value when they provide functionality that national networks and electronic health record interoperability cannot replicate, but they subtract value when activity metrics obscure minimal clinical utility. Maryland CRISP demonstrates value through genuine integration, but mature systems where only 4.7% of connected clinicians access clinical information demonstrate risk when extensive reporting masks limited functionality. Area Health Education Centers add value when their infrastructure accelerates workforce pipeline development with demonstrated retention outcomes, but they subtract value when incumbent status protects approaches that do not work. North Carolina AHEC demonstrates value through outcome tracking, yet evidence shows rural origin predicts practice location more powerfully than training exposure through AHEC programs. Public health coalitions add value when aggregation enables specialized functions small departments cannot achieve while preserving community accountability, but they subtract value when efficiency gains do not reach communities and regional governance distances decisions from affected populations. Multi-stakeholder collaboratives add value when governance structures give community members actual power over priorities, but they subtract value when inclusive appearance legitimizes provider-dominated decisions and community participation becomes ratification rather than influence.\nEvidence across all intermediary types supports value under specific conditions. Clear accountability to state agencies with transformation metrics rather than activity-based reporting justifies intermediary involvement. Intermediaries operating under outcome-based contracts with independent verification add demonstrable value, while activity-based reporting without outcome accountability enables overhead extraction. Capacity demonstrably exceeding what states could provide directly justifies intermediary overhead. Generic coordination that states could perform directly does not warrant the additional layer. Member or stakeholder trust enabling honest engagement creates value when intermediaries can deliver difficult messages that state agencies cannot, but this trust-based value exists only when intermediaries prioritize transformation over member protection. Overhead proportionate to documented value-add distinguishes legitimate coordination costs from rent-seeking behavior. Some overhead is inevitable, as coordination requires staff and technical assistance requires expertise, but overhead exceeding 25 to 30 percent without documented transformation contribution suggests value extraction rather than value creation.\nConversely, intermediary rent-seeking occurs under different conditions. Overhead exceeding 30 percent without documented transformation outcomes suggests resources absorbed without proportionate benefit, particularly when combined with activity reporting rather than outcome evidence. Technical assistance focused on compliance rather than improvement serves intermediary sustainability more than transformation goals, as compliance-focused assistance perpetuates intermediary need without addressing underlying challenges. Member protection trumping transformation when they conflict reveals the core tension facing membership organizations, whether they serve members or transformation goals when these diverge. Activities substituting for outcomes in reporting enables intermediary survival without transformation contribution, as webinars conducted and technical assistance sessions delivered tell states what intermediaries did rather than what they accomplished. Sustainability dependent on perpetuating problems creates structural conflicts when intermediary business models require ongoing rural health challenges, producing perverse incentives that oppose the transformation that would reduce need for their services.\nA comparison of two hypothetical states illustrates these dynamics. State A awards major subawards totaling $200 million (45 percent of its RHTP allocation) to its hospital association, Primary Care Association, AHEC, Regional Health Information Organization, and multi-stakeholder collaborative. The rationale emphasizes relationships state agencies cannot replicate. By year three, State A reports impressive activity metrics: 234 technical assistance engagements by the hospital association, 156 staff trained across 28 health centers by the PCA, 89 student rotations through the AHEC, 67 percent of rural providers connected to the health information exchange, and 42 stakeholder meetings convened by the collaborative. Yet outcome metrics disappoint. Rural hospital financial margins have not improved despite $80 million in hospital association investment, access metrics show minimal change with primary care appointment availability remaining at 72 percent of urban levels, workforce vacancy rates declined only 2 percentage points against a target of 15, and health outcomes show no statistically significant improvement.\nState B maintains direct relationships with rural hospitals and health centers, using competitive procurement for targeted technical assistance and awarding only $18 million (4 percent of its allocation) for specific intermediary functions. Direct provider relationships enable rapid identification and resolution of implementation barriers. When telehealth reimbursement rules block expansion, direct hospital relationships enable policy correction within 60 days rather than filtering through intermediary communication channels. Competitive procurement attracts specialized behavioral health integration expertise that the state’s AHEC could not provide. By year three, rural hospital margins improved 3.2 percentage points, primary care appointment availability reached 89 percent of urban levels in seven of twelve target communities, workforce vacancy rates declined 18 percentage points through direct recruitment incentives, and diabetes control rates improved 4.2 percentage points in communities receiving direct transformation support.\nThe difference stems from coordination overhead without proportionate transformation in State A. Each intermediary reported activities to the state but none was accountable for outcomes. Information flowed from providers to intermediaries, from intermediaries to the state, and back, creating delays and filtering that obscured ground truth. The intermediary ecosystem became self-referential, with organizations coordinating with each other, attending each other’s meetings, and producing joint reports while providers struggled with implementation challenges that activity metrics did not capture. State B’s minimal intermediation concentrated resources on direct transformation support. Without intermediary layers, the state maintained visibility into implementation challenges, and competitive procurement attracted expertise matched to specific needs rather than general-purpose capacity.\nMultiple alternative perspectives challenge this intermediary-critical analysis. The disintermediation argument claims that technology increasingly enables direct relationships, reducing intermediary necessity through national health information networks, electronic health record vendor interoperability, and direct federal-provider relationships. This perspective is partially valid for some functions, as large health systems can connect directly to national networks without state intermediation and HRSA maintains direct relationships with FQHCs that could bypass state PCAs. However, disintermediation works less well for small rural providers lacking information technology capacity, for coordination functions requiring local relationships, and for community engagement requiring trusted local presence. The capture critique claims intermediary organizations inevitably prioritize organizational survival over transformation goals, as membership organizations serve members and grant-dependent organizations serve funders rather than communities. This structural observation is valid, as organizational survival requires satisfying stakeholders who control resources, and community voice is structurally weak unless governance arrangements give communities actual power.\nThe necessary infrastructure defense claims that intermediaries represent essential infrastructure that cannot be replicated, with relationships built over decades enabling engagement that state agencies cannot achieve. This argument is valid in thin markets where alternatives do not exist, as rural states with limited organizational infrastructure may have no alternatives to existing intermediaries regardless of their limitations. However, necessity should be assessed rather than assumed, as urban areas and states with robust organizational ecosystems may have alternatives that render intermediary involvement optional. The community accountability gap critique observes that intermediaries answer to members, funders, and state agencies rather than communities served. This accountability gap is structural, not incidental. Hospital associations answer to member hospitals, PCAs answer to member health centers, Regional Health Information Organizations answer to connected providers, public health coalitions answer to member jurisdictions, and collaboratives answer to participating organizations. In none of these structures do affected communities hold governance power.\nThe honest assessment requires recognizing that intermediaries are neither universally helpful nor universally harmful. Function fit matters more than blanket intermediary involvement or exclusion, as some functions suit intermediary involvement while others are more effective through state contracts with specialized vendors. Organizational quality varies enormously within each intermediary type, with the best PCAs delivering sophisticated transformation support that states cannot replicate while the weakest provide legitimacy cover for inadequate capacity. Accountability structure determines whether incentives align with transformation, as outcome-based accountability with independent verification can align intermediary incentives with transformation goals while activity-based reporting enables rent-seeking regardless of organizational intentions. State capacity shapes appropriate intermediary reliance, as states with robust agency capacity and competitive provider markets\n",

<p>The Rural Health Transformation Program assumes intermediaries add value to implementation, but this assumption warrants scrutiny. State agencies lack the capacity to maintain relationships with thousands of Critical Access Hospitals, FQHCs, and rural clinics while simultaneously developing specialized expertise in workforce development, health information exchange, and population health management. Intermediaries theoretically fill these gaps by aggregating providers, coordinating activities, and translating policy into practice. However, <strong>overhead absorbs resources that could otherwise reach providers and communities</strong>, organizational interests may diverge from transformation goals, and accountability becomes diffuse when funding flows through multiple layers. The question confronting RHTP implementation is not whether intermediaries matter but whether their contribution exceeds their cost.</p>
<p>Analysis of six intermediary types reveals a consistent pattern: <strong>value is conditional rather than inherent</strong>. No intermediary category uniformly helps or hinders transformation. Hospital associations add value when transformation strengthens member hospitals through network development and shared services, but they subtract value when transformation requires member closure, conversion, or market share loss. The TORCH network in Texas demonstrates value-add through peer learning and network coordination, while associations that protect member hospitals that should convert to Rural Emergency Hospitals demonstrate value extraction. FQHCs and Primary Care Associations add value when their legitimacy with safety-net providers enables honest engagement about difficult transformation, but they subtract value when legitimacy masks capacity limitations. Colorado&rsquo;s CCHN demonstrates value through sophisticated community health worker training programs, while PCAs receiving subawards exceeding their organizational capacity demonstrate risk.</p>
<p>Regional Health Information Organizations add value when they provide functionality that national networks and electronic health record interoperability cannot replicate, but they subtract value when activity metrics obscure minimal clinical utility. Maryland CRISP demonstrates value through genuine integration, but mature systems where only 4.7% of connected clinicians access clinical information demonstrate risk when extensive reporting masks limited functionality. Area Health Education Centers add value when their infrastructure accelerates workforce pipeline development with demonstrated retention outcomes, but they subtract value when incumbent status protects approaches that do not work. North Carolina AHEC demonstrates value through outcome tracking, yet evidence shows rural origin predicts practice location more powerfully than training exposure through AHEC programs. Public health coalitions add value when aggregation enables specialized functions small departments cannot achieve while preserving community accountability, but they subtract value when efficiency gains do not reach communities and regional governance distances decisions from affected populations. Multi-stakeholder collaboratives add value when governance structures give community members actual power over priorities, but they subtract value when inclusive appearance legitimizes provider-dominated decisions and community participation becomes ratification rather than influence.</p>
<p>Evidence across all intermediary types supports value under specific conditions. <strong>Clear accountability to state agencies with transformation metrics</strong> rather than activity-based reporting justifies intermediary involvement. Intermediaries operating under outcome-based contracts with independent verification add demonstrable value, while activity-based reporting without outcome accountability enables overhead extraction. Capacity demonstrably exceeding what states could provide directly justifies intermediary overhead. Generic coordination that states could perform directly does not warrant the additional layer. Member or stakeholder trust enabling honest engagement creates value when intermediaries can deliver difficult messages that state agencies cannot, but this trust-based value exists only when intermediaries prioritize transformation over member protection. <strong>Overhead proportionate to documented value-add</strong> distinguishes legitimate coordination costs from rent-seeking behavior. Some overhead is inevitable, as coordination requires staff and technical assistance requires expertise, but overhead exceeding 25 to 30 percent without documented transformation contribution suggests value extraction rather than value creation.</p>
<p>Conversely, intermediary rent-seeking occurs under different conditions. Overhead exceeding 30 percent without documented transformation outcomes suggests resources absorbed without proportionate benefit, particularly when combined with activity reporting rather than outcome evidence. Technical assistance focused on compliance rather than improvement serves intermediary sustainability more than transformation goals, as compliance-focused assistance perpetuates intermediary need without addressing underlying challenges. Member protection trumping transformation when they conflict reveals the core tension facing membership organizations, whether they serve members or transformation goals when these diverge. <strong>Activities substituting for outcomes in reporting</strong> enables intermediary survival without transformation contribution, as webinars conducted and technical assistance sessions delivered tell states what intermediaries did rather than what they accomplished. Sustainability dependent on perpetuating problems creates structural conflicts when intermediary business models require ongoing rural health challenges, producing perverse incentives that oppose the transformation that would reduce need for their services.</p>
<p>A comparison of two hypothetical states illustrates these dynamics. State A awards major subawards totaling $200 million (45 percent of its RHTP allocation) to its hospital association, Primary Care Association, AHEC, Regional Health Information Organization, and multi-stakeholder collaborative. The rationale emphasizes relationships state agencies cannot replicate. By year three, State A reports impressive activity metrics: 234 technical assistance engagements by the hospital association, 156 staff trained across 28 health centers by the PCA, 89 student rotations through the AHEC, 67 percent of rural providers connected to the health information exchange, and 42 stakeholder meetings convened by the collaborative. Yet outcome metrics disappoint. Rural hospital financial margins have not improved despite $80 million in hospital association investment, access metrics show minimal change with primary care appointment availability remaining at 72 percent of urban levels, workforce vacancy rates declined only 2 percentage points against a target of 15, and health outcomes show no statistically significant improvement.</p>
<p>State B maintains direct relationships with rural hospitals and health centers, using competitive procurement for targeted technical assistance and awarding only $18 million (4 percent of its allocation) for specific intermediary functions. Direct provider relationships enable rapid identification and resolution of implementation barriers. When telehealth reimbursement rules block expansion, direct hospital relationships enable policy correction within 60 days rather than filtering through intermediary communication channels. Competitive procurement attracts specialized behavioral health integration expertise that the state&rsquo;s AHEC could not provide. By year three, rural hospital margins improved 3.2 percentage points, primary care appointment availability reached 89 percent of urban levels in seven of twelve target communities, workforce vacancy rates declined 18 percentage points through direct recruitment incentives, and diabetes control rates improved 4.2 percentage points in communities receiving direct transformation support.</p>
<p>The difference stems from coordination overhead without proportionate transformation in State A. Each intermediary reported activities to the state but none was accountable for outcomes. Information flowed from providers to intermediaries, from intermediaries to the state, and back, creating delays and filtering that obscured ground truth. <strong>The intermediary ecosystem became self-referential</strong>, with organizations coordinating with each other, attending each other&rsquo;s meetings, and producing joint reports while providers struggled with implementation challenges that activity metrics did not capture. State B&rsquo;s minimal intermediation concentrated resources on direct transformation support. Without intermediary layers, the state maintained visibility into implementation challenges, and competitive procurement attracted expertise matched to specific needs rather than general-purpose capacity.</p>
<p>Multiple alternative perspectives challenge this intermediary-critical analysis. The disintermediation argument claims that technology increasingly enables direct relationships, reducing intermediary necessity through national health information networks, electronic health record vendor interoperability, and direct federal-provider relationships. This perspective is partially valid for some functions, as large health systems can connect directly to national networks without state intermediation and HRSA maintains direct relationships with FQHCs that could bypass state PCAs. However, disintermediation works less well for small rural providers lacking information technology capacity, for coordination functions requiring local relationships, and for community engagement requiring trusted local presence. The capture critique claims intermediary organizations inevitably prioritize organizational survival over transformation goals, as membership organizations serve members and grant-dependent organizations serve funders rather than communities. This structural observation is valid, as organizational survival requires satisfying stakeholders who control resources, and community voice is structurally weak unless governance arrangements give communities actual power.</p>
<p>The necessary infrastructure defense claims that intermediaries represent essential infrastructure that cannot be replicated, with relationships built over decades enabling engagement that state agencies cannot achieve. This argument is valid in thin markets where alternatives do not exist, as rural states with limited organizational infrastructure may have no alternatives to existing intermediaries regardless of their limitations. However, necessity should be assessed rather than assumed, as urban areas and states with robust organizational ecosystems may have alternatives that render intermediary involvement optional. The community accountability gap critique observes that intermediaries answer to members, funders, and state agencies rather than communities served. This accountability gap is structural, not incidental. Hospital associations answer to member hospitals, PCAs answer to member health centers, Regional Health Information Organizations answer to connected providers, public health coalitions answer to member jurisdictions, and collaboratives answer to participating organizations. In none of these structures do affected communities hold governance power.</p>
<p>The honest assessment requires recognizing that intermediaries are neither universally helpful nor universally harmful. Function fit matters more than blanket intermediary involvement or exclusion, as some functions suit intermediary involvement while others are more effective through state contracts with specialized vendors. <strong>Organizational quality varies enormously within each intermediary type</strong>, with the best PCAs delivering sophisticated transformation support that states cannot replicate while the weakest provide legitimacy cover for inadequate capacity. Accountability structure determines whether incentives align with transformation, as outcome-based accountability with independent verification can align intermediary incentives with transformation goals while activity-based reporting enables rent-seeking regardless of organizational intentions. State capacity shapes appropriate intermediary reliance, as states with robust agency capacity and competitive provider markets</p>
