  "articleBody": "Regional Health Information Organizations confront a stark dilemma within the Rural Health Transformation Program: they promise the data infrastructure that enables genuine transformation while frequently delivering only expensive organizational overhead. The premise appears straightforward. Transformation requires information, information requires exchange, exchange requires infrastructure, and RHIOs provide that infrastructure. But this logical chain breaks down when infrastructure exists primarily on paper, when providers technically participate without actually exchanging data, and when states lack the technical capacity to distinguish functional systems from elaborate activity reporting.\nThe theoretical case for RHIOs as transformation infrastructure holds considerable force. Rural healthcare transformation depends on several capabilities that require information exchange. Care coordination across fragmented systems represents the core use case. When rural patients travel to urban specialists, present to emergency departments, or receive care from multiple providers, treating physicians need access to medication lists, allergies, recent test results, and active diagnoses. Without exchange infrastructure, this information exists only in patient memory or scattered across disconnected systems. Population health management similarly requires aggregated data that no single provider possesses. Identifying high-risk patients, tracking vaccination coverage, monitoring chronic disease outcomes, and targeting interventions all depend on data from multiple sources. Individual providers see only their own patients; population health requires the broader view that aggregation enables. Quality measurement and improvement for RHTP outcome requirements depend on data spanning multiple providers and settings. Public health integration has become increasingly urgent since COVID-19 exposed reporting infrastructure limitations, with electronic case reporting, syndromic surveillance, and disease tracking all benefiting from HIE infrastructure connecting clinical care to public health systems. The Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement now provides federal backing for nationwide interoperability, with seven Qualified Health Information Networks connecting over 244 million individuals, creating new possibilities while raising questions about whether state-level RHIO infrastructure remains necessary.\nAgainst this technical promise stands persistent evidence of HIE sustainability challenges and limited actual use. Many RHIOs depend primarily on grant funding rather than sustainable revenue models, suggesting that value propositions for participating organizations have not materialized sufficiently to support ongoing operations. Research consistently shows limited participation and use despite organizational claims. One study found that only 10.7% of US hospitals engaged in HIE with unaffiliated providers, indicating that organizational participation rates dramatically overstate actual exchange activity. Hospitals may technically participate while rarely or never exchanging data. Critical Access Hospitals, the rural facilities most dependent on transformation, show particularly low HIE participation. South Carolina data found that while overall hospital HIE participation increased from 43% in 2014 to 82% by 2020, Critical Access Hospitals were 90% less likely to participate than prospective payment system hospitals even after controlling for other factors. The facilities that transformation targets may be least connected to the infrastructure designed to support them.\nEven where infrastructure exists, actual use rates remain discouragingly low. Indiana’s mature statewide HIE, the Indiana Network for Patient Care, connects 117 hospitals and over 17,000 practices yet found that only 4.7% of all clinical encounters resulted in providers accessing external patient information through the exchange. Infrastructure existence does not equal infrastructure use. Competition dynamics further undermine exchange, with for-profit hospitals and those with smaller market shares significantly less likely to engage in HIE, suggesting that competitive concerns about sharing data with rivals override potential benefits. Rural transformation requires collaboration that market dynamics actively discourage.\nThe variation across state-designated HIEs and major RHIOs illustrates capacity and functionality differences. Indiana’s INPC represents mature, functional infrastructure developed over two decades with demonstrated use patterns and measurable value, receiving $8.2 million in RHTP subawards for population health data support. Maryland’s CRISP, connecting 4,000 care sites with ADT alerts, query capabilities, analytics, and PDMP integration, received $7.8 million for care coordination infrastructure. Colorado’s CORHIO, serving 8,500 providers with query capabilities, public health reporting, and rural outreach, received $6.4 million for rural connectivity. New York’s SHIN-NY Network, comprising 10 RHIOs statewide offering federated query and transformation data support, received $14.6 million. Kansas Health Information Network, connecting 180 care sites with direct messaging and limited query functionality, received $2.9 million for basic exchange capabilities. The variation is stark. Some organizations represent sophisticated infrastructure that transformation requires; others offer basic functionality that may not justify the overhead required to maintain it.\nA fundamental challenge pervades RHIO oversight: the difference between activity and outcome often remains invisible to state agencies. RHIOs report activities because activities are measurable and contractually defensible. Onboarding sessions conducted, alerts deployed, dashboards developed, data feeds established. Activity metrics can appear strong while actual functionality remains limited. States typically lack technical expertise to assess RHIO claims independently. Agencies overseeing RHTP implementation employ policy analysts and program managers, not health IT specialists. When an HIE reports deploying care coordination alerts to 23 facilities, the state cannot easily determine whether 23 facilities actively use those alerts or whether the technology sits dormant. This pattern produces predictable failure modes. Onboarding sessions occur, but providers do not adopt systems. Alerts deploy, but workflows do not incorporate them. Dashboards exist, but data does not populate them. Population health analytics require data from 34 rural providers but contain information from only 12. Public health data feeds transmit information but format inconsistencies prevent integration. This pattern is not universal, as high-functioning HIEs demonstrate that meaningful exchange can occur, but distinguishing genuinely functional infrastructure from activity-reporting organizations requires technical assessment capacity that most state agencies lack. RHTP investment in RHIO infrastructure without corresponding investment in state oversight capacity risks funding technology that exists on paper while providers continue operating in information silos.\nSome observers argue that state-level RHIOs represent obsolete infrastructure whose functions have been superseded by national networks and vendor-enabled interoperability. National networks now enable direct exchange without state-level intermediaries. CommonWell Health Alliance connects over 37,000 provider organizations with more than 8.5 billion health records retrieved. Carequality links additional networks and EHR vendors. TEFCA creates a framework for nationwide interoperability with federal backing. EHR vendors increasingly offer built-in interoperability through Epic’s Care Everywhere, Cerner’s CommonWell integration, and similar capabilities enabling exchange among facilities using the same or connected systems. For providers already connected through their EHR vendor, a state RHIO may duplicate existing functionality while adding cost. This disintermediation argument is partially valid for clinical exchange between large providers but less valid for specific functions that rural transformation requires. National networks connect primarily large health systems with sophisticated EHR implementations. Rural providers, particularly small practices and Critical Access Hospitals with older systems and limited IT capacity, often lack infrastructure to leverage national network connectivity directly. State-level RHIOs retain potential value for rural provider connectivity to providers too small to connect directly to national networks, public health data integration with state surveillance systems, population health analytics using data aggregated across defined geographies, and local relationship management supporting adoption and workflow integration.\nRHIO subawards reveal consistent patterns suggesting implementation risks. Technical deliverables often lack specificity, with subawards specifying “data exchange infrastructure” or “population health capabilities” without defining measurable functionality standards. This vagueness enables RHIOs to report completion while actual functionality remains uncertain. Sustainability models rarely survive beyond grant funding. RHIOs propose fee-based or value-based sustainability during subaward negotiation, but these models typically depend on provider adoption rates that do not materialize or payer participation that fails to emerge. RHTP funding often supports organizations that will struggle to continue operations after 2030. Rural provider focus varies significantly across subawards. Some explicitly target rural connectivity and measure progress by rural provider adoption; others treat rural providers as one segment among many with limited accountability for rural-specific outcomes. Pass-through percentages range from 15% to 55%, with some RHIOs retaining most funding for infrastructure and staff while passing limited resources to providers. Outcome accountability remains rare. States measure provider connections, system deployments, and data volume but rarely measure whether providers access exchanged data, whether access improves clinical decisions, or whether patients experience better coordinated care.\nRHIOs contribute genuine value under specific conditions. Mature, functional infrastructure that predates RHTP demonstrates years of operational experience. States like Indiana, Maryland, and Colorado built infrastructure over decades before RHTP existed, with RHTP funding enhancing existing capability rather than building from scratch. Population health data aggregation for rural areas provides value that small rural providers cannot generate independently. State HIEs with comprehensive rural provider participation can produce analytics that individual facilities cannot, though this value depends on actual rural provider data flowing through the exchange. Public health integration proved its worth during COVID-19, when states with functional HIE infrastructure responded more effectively to pandemic surveillance needs. Quality measurement support for RHTP outcome requirements depends on HIE capacity to aggregate data from multiple sources and produce reliable, standardized measures. Rural provider technical assistance pairs infrastructure with implementation support, helping rural providers adopt systems and integrate exchange into workflows in a combination proving more\n",

<p>Regional Health Information Organizations confront a stark dilemma within the Rural Health Transformation Program: they promise the data infrastructure that enables genuine transformation while frequently delivering only expensive organizational overhead. The premise appears straightforward. Transformation requires information, information requires exchange, exchange requires infrastructure, and RHIOs provide that infrastructure. But this logical chain breaks down when infrastructure exists primarily on paper, when providers technically participate without actually exchanging data, and when states lack the technical capacity to distinguish functional systems from elaborate activity reporting.</p>
<p>The theoretical case for RHIOs as transformation infrastructure holds considerable force. Rural healthcare transformation depends on several capabilities that require information exchange. <strong>Care coordination across fragmented systems</strong> represents the core use case. When rural patients travel to urban specialists, present to emergency departments, or receive care from multiple providers, treating physicians need access to medication lists, allergies, recent test results, and active diagnoses. Without exchange infrastructure, this information exists only in patient memory or scattered across disconnected systems. Population health management similarly requires aggregated data that no single provider possesses. Identifying high-risk patients, tracking vaccination coverage, monitoring chronic disease outcomes, and targeting interventions all depend on data from multiple sources. Individual providers see only their own patients; population health requires the broader view that aggregation enables. Quality measurement and improvement for RHTP outcome requirements depend on data spanning multiple providers and settings. Public health integration has become increasingly urgent since COVID-19 exposed reporting infrastructure limitations, with electronic case reporting, syndromic surveillance, and disease tracking all benefiting from HIE infrastructure connecting clinical care to public health systems. The Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement now provides federal backing for nationwide interoperability, with <strong>seven Qualified Health Information Networks connecting over 244 million individuals</strong>, creating new possibilities while raising questions about whether state-level RHIO infrastructure remains necessary.</p>
<p>Against this technical promise stands persistent evidence of HIE sustainability challenges and limited actual use. Many RHIOs depend primarily on grant funding rather than sustainable revenue models, suggesting that value propositions for participating organizations have not materialized sufficiently to support ongoing operations. Research consistently shows limited participation and use despite organizational claims. One study found that <strong>only 10.7% of US hospitals engaged in HIE with unaffiliated providers</strong>, indicating that organizational participation rates dramatically overstate actual exchange activity. Hospitals may technically participate while rarely or never exchanging data. Critical Access Hospitals, the rural facilities most dependent on transformation, show particularly low HIE participation. South Carolina data found that while overall hospital HIE participation increased from 43% in 2014 to 82% by 2020, <strong>Critical Access Hospitals were 90% less likely to participate</strong> than prospective payment system hospitals even after controlling for other factors. The facilities that transformation targets may be least connected to the infrastructure designed to support them.</p>
<p>Even where infrastructure exists, actual use rates remain discouragingly low. Indiana&rsquo;s mature statewide HIE, the Indiana Network for Patient Care, connects 117 hospitals and over 17,000 practices yet found that <strong>only 4.7% of all clinical encounters resulted in providers accessing external patient information</strong> through the exchange. Infrastructure existence does not equal infrastructure use. Competition dynamics further undermine exchange, with for-profit hospitals and those with smaller market shares significantly less likely to engage in HIE, suggesting that competitive concerns about sharing data with rivals override potential benefits. Rural transformation requires collaboration that market dynamics actively discourage.</p>
<p>The variation across state-designated HIEs and major RHIOs illustrates capacity and functionality differences. Indiana&rsquo;s INPC represents mature, functional infrastructure developed over two decades with demonstrated use patterns and measurable value, receiving $8.2 million in RHTP subawards for population health data support. Maryland&rsquo;s CRISP, connecting 4,000 care sites with ADT alerts, query capabilities, analytics, and PDMP integration, received $7.8 million for care coordination infrastructure. Colorado&rsquo;s CORHIO, serving 8,500 providers with query capabilities, public health reporting, and rural outreach, received $6.4 million for rural connectivity. New York&rsquo;s SHIN-NY Network, comprising 10 RHIOs statewide offering federated query and transformation data support, received $14.6 million. Kansas Health Information Network, connecting 180 care sites with direct messaging and limited query functionality, received $2.9 million for basic exchange capabilities. The variation is stark. Some organizations represent sophisticated infrastructure that transformation requires; others offer basic functionality that may not justify the overhead required to maintain it.</p>
<p>A fundamental challenge pervades RHIO oversight: <strong>the difference between activity and outcome often remains invisible to state agencies</strong>. RHIOs report activities because activities are measurable and contractually defensible. Onboarding sessions conducted, alerts deployed, dashboards developed, data feeds established. Activity metrics can appear strong while actual functionality remains limited. States typically lack technical expertise to assess RHIO claims independently. Agencies overseeing RHTP implementation employ policy analysts and program managers, not health IT specialists. When an HIE reports deploying care coordination alerts to 23 facilities, the state cannot easily determine whether 23 facilities actively use those alerts or whether the technology sits dormant. This pattern produces predictable failure modes. Onboarding sessions occur, but providers do not adopt systems. Alerts deploy, but workflows do not incorporate them. Dashboards exist, but data does not populate them. Population health analytics require data from 34 rural providers but contain information from only 12. Public health data feeds transmit information but format inconsistencies prevent integration. This pattern is not universal, as high-functioning HIEs demonstrate that meaningful exchange can occur, but <strong>distinguishing genuinely functional infrastructure from activity-reporting organizations requires technical assessment capacity that most state agencies lack</strong>. RHTP investment in RHIO infrastructure without corresponding investment in state oversight capacity risks funding technology that exists on paper while providers continue operating in information silos.</p>
<p>Some observers argue that <strong>state-level RHIOs represent obsolete infrastructure</strong> whose functions have been superseded by national networks and vendor-enabled interoperability. National networks now enable direct exchange without state-level intermediaries. CommonWell Health Alliance connects over 37,000 provider organizations with more than 8.5 billion health records retrieved. Carequality links additional networks and EHR vendors. TEFCA creates a framework for nationwide interoperability with federal backing. EHR vendors increasingly offer built-in interoperability through Epic&rsquo;s Care Everywhere, Cerner&rsquo;s CommonWell integration, and similar capabilities enabling exchange among facilities using the same or connected systems. For providers already connected through their EHR vendor, a state RHIO may duplicate existing functionality while adding cost. This disintermediation argument is partially valid for clinical exchange between large providers but less valid for specific functions that rural transformation requires. National networks connect primarily large health systems with sophisticated EHR implementations. Rural providers, particularly small practices and Critical Access Hospitals with older systems and limited IT capacity, often lack infrastructure to leverage national network connectivity directly. State-level RHIOs retain potential value for rural provider connectivity to providers too small to connect directly to national networks, public health data integration with state surveillance systems, population health analytics using data aggregated across defined geographies, and local relationship management supporting adoption and workflow integration.</p>
<p>RHIO subawards reveal consistent patterns suggesting implementation risks. <strong>Technical deliverables often lack specificity</strong>, with subawards specifying &ldquo;data exchange infrastructure&rdquo; or &ldquo;population health capabilities&rdquo; without defining measurable functionality standards. This vagueness enables RHIOs to report completion while actual functionality remains uncertain. Sustainability models rarely survive beyond grant funding. RHIOs propose fee-based or value-based sustainability during subaward negotiation, but these models typically depend on provider adoption rates that do not materialize or payer participation that fails to emerge. RHTP funding often supports organizations that will struggle to continue operations after 2030. Rural provider focus varies significantly across subawards. Some explicitly target rural connectivity and measure progress by rural provider adoption; others treat rural providers as one segment among many with limited accountability for rural-specific outcomes. Pass-through percentages range from 15% to 55%, with some RHIOs retaining most funding for infrastructure and staff while passing limited resources to providers. Outcome accountability remains rare. States measure provider connections, system deployments, and data volume but rarely measure whether providers access exchanged data, whether access improves clinical decisions, or whether patients experience better coordinated care.</p>
<p>RHIOs contribute genuine value under specific conditions. <strong>Mature, functional infrastructure that predates RHTP</strong> demonstrates years of operational experience. States like Indiana, Maryland, and Colorado built infrastructure over decades before RHTP existed, with RHTP funding enhancing existing capability rather than building from scratch. Population health data aggregation for rural areas provides value that small rural providers cannot generate independently. State HIEs with comprehensive rural provider participation can produce analytics that individual facilities cannot, though this value depends on actual rural provider data flowing through the exchange. Public health integration proved its worth during COVID-19, when states with functional HIE infrastructure responded more effectively to pandemic surveillance needs. Quality measurement support for RHTP outcome requirements depends on HIE capacity to aggregate data from multiple sources and produce reliable, standardized measures. Rural provider technical assistance pairs infrastructure with implementation support, helping rural providers adopt systems and integrate exchange into workflows in a combination proving more</p>
