  "articleBody": "Primary Care Associations occupy a unique intermediary position in RHTP implementation. They have legitimacy that hospital associations lack: decades of relationships with safety-net providers, deep understanding of community health center operations, and credibility built through consistent support. Federally Qualified Health Centers trust their PCAs in ways that enable transformation conversations other intermediaries cannot initiate.\nBut legitimacy does not equal capacity. PCAs vary enormously in organizational sophistication, ranging from California’s 65-person operation with $18 million in annual revenue to states where three-person teams struggle to meet basic HRSA reporting requirements. The gap between what PCAs are trusted to do and what they can actually deliver shapes RHTP implementation in ways that state agencies often fail to anticipate.\nThis article examines the capacity-legitimacy tension that defines PCA involvement in rural health transformation. The question is not whether PCAs should participate, but whether states understand what they are getting when they route transformation funding through organizations whose credibility exceeds their capacity.\nThe Legitimacy Foundation Primary Care Associations have served Federally Qualified Health Centers since the 1970s. Every state and several regions have HRSA-funded PCAs providing training, technical assistance, and advocacy. This sustained presence has built relationships that newer intermediaries cannot match.\nFQHC executives trust PCAs because PCAs have delivered for decades. When new HRSA requirements create compliance challenges, PCAs provide guidance. When health centers face operational difficulties, PCAs offer consulting support. When policy changes threaten the safety net, PCAs advocate. This consistent support creates bonds that transform transactional relationships into genuine partnerships.\nThe community health center model reinforces PCA credibility. FQHCs serve medically underserved populations through sliding-fee services, community-governed boards, and comprehensive care integration. Health centers share a mission-driven identity that distinguishes them from for-profit providers. PCAs speak this language fluently, understanding not just operations but values.\nRural FQHCs and FQHC look-alikes represent a growing share of the safety-net infrastructure serving rural communities. More than 300 health center sites operate in rural designated areas, providing primary care access to populations that might otherwise go without. Many rural communities that have lost hospitals now depend on health centers as their primary healthcare access point.\nPCAs understand rural health center challenges distinctly from hospital association perspectives. Rural FQHCs face workforce constraints, transportation barriers, and population health challenges that require different approaches than hospital stabilization. PCAs bring this contextual understanding to RHTP conversations.\nThe trust relationship enables sensitive conversations. FQHC executives share financial concerns, governance challenges, and operational struggles with PCA staff that they would not disclose to state regulators or consultants. This information sharing enables PCAs to identify problems early and provide assistance before crises develop.\nThe Capacity Question Against this legitimacy advantage, PCA capacity constraints loom large. The 54 state and regional PCAs vary enormously in organizational sophistication.\nStaffing levels range from 3 FTEs to more than 60. The California Primary Care Association maintains substantial teams covering policy, clinical quality, health information technology, workforce, and multiple specialized programs. The Nevada Primary Care Association operates with fewer than 10 staff serving the state’s health centers. Both are HRSA-funded PCAs with similar formal responsibilities, but their capacity to deliver differs by an order of magnitude.\nBudget disparities compound staffing differences. Large-state PCAs like California, Texas, and New York have annual budgets exceeding $10 million, combining HRSA cooperative agreements with state contracts, foundation grants, and fee-for-service revenues. Small-state PCAs may operate on $1 million or less, relying almost entirely on HRSA funding with minimal additional resources.\nTechnical expertise varies accordingly. Well-resourced PCAs employ clinical quality specialists, health IT experts, financial analysts, and workforce development coordinators. Smaller PCAs rely on generalists who cover multiple functions without deep expertise in any. When RHTP requires sophisticated technical assistance, PCAs without relevant expertise cannot deliver regardless of their legitimacy.\nMany PCAs have never managed transformation programs at RHTP scale. HRSA cooperative agreements fund training, technical assistance, and advocacy, not major capital investments or system redesign. PCAs accustomed to supporting health centers through regulatory compliance and quality improvement may lack experience guiding fundamental operational transformation.\nPCA and Network Landscape The following table illustrates capacity variation across PCAs receiving RHTP-related funding:\nOrganization State FQHC Members Staff FTE Annual Budget RHTP Role Subaward Capacity Level California Primary Care Assn CA 219 65 $18.2M Workforce, quality, rural expansion $16M High Texas Assn of Community Health Centers TX 76 38 $9.4M Rural TA, care model development $12M High Pennsylvania Assn of Community Health Centers PA 44 28 $6.8M Quality improvement, workforce $8M Moderate-High Georgia Primary Care Assn GA 34 22 $4.9M Rural access, integration $7M Moderate North Carolina Community Health Center Assn NC 43 19 $4.2M Network coordination, TA $6M Moderate Ohio Assn of Community Health Centers OH 52 24 $5.1M Quality, rural expansion $5M Moderate Kentucky Primary Care Assn KY 28 12 $2.8M Rural TA, workforce $4M Moderate-Low Montana Primary Care Assn MT 18 8 $1.9M Rural coordination, TA $3M Low Nevada Primary Care Assn NV 12 6 $1.4M Basic TA, coordination $2M Low Capacity levels reflect overall organizational ability to deliver complex transformation support, considering staffing, budget, technical expertise, and demonstrated program management experience. High-capacity PCAs can manage sophisticated multi-year transformation initiatives. Low-capacity PCAs struggle to deliver technical assistance beyond basic compliance support.\nThe subaward amounts often exceed what PCA capacity can effectively deploy. Nevada’s PCA, with 6 staff and $1.4 million budget, received $2 million in RHTP subaward that nearly doubled its organizational resources. Managing subawards larger than the organization’s existing budget strains administrative systems and diverts attention from core functions.\nCase Study: The Capacity Gap in Action The Appalachian Community Health Initiative (name changed) illustrates how PCA legitimacy can mask capacity limitations with consequences for transformation implementation.\nThe West Virginia Primary Care Association had served the state’s health centers for 28 years when RHTP implementation began. With 14 staff and a $2.3 million budget, the PCA maintained strong relationships with West Virginia’s 31 FQHCs. Health center executives trusted the PCA implicitly, seeking guidance on everything from HRSA compliance to strategic planning.\nWest Virginia’s RHTP application designated the PCA as lead intermediary for safety-net transformation, with a $5.8 million subaward over three years. The transformation scope included care model redesign, behavioral health integration, telehealth expansion, and workforce pipeline development. The subaward represented 2.5 times the PCA’s existing annual budget.\nThe first year revealed capacity gaps. The PCA had no staff with behavioral health integration expertise, despite this being a major transformation priority. Telehealth technical assistance fell to a generalist who had never implemented telehealth systems. Workforce pipeline coordination required relationships with educational institutions that the PCA had not cultivated.\nThe PCA responded by hiring, but hiring proved difficult. Rural West Virginia is not an attractive labor market for health policy professionals. After nine months, the PCA had filled only two of five new positions, both with candidates requiring substantial onboarding before they could deliver technical assistance.\nMeanwhile, health centers expected transformation support that the PCA could not provide. Cabin Creek Health Center wanted guidance on integrating psychiatric services into primary care, but the PCA’s behavioral health consultant had started only two months earlier and was still learning the state landscape. Minnie Hamilton Health System sought telehealth implementation support, but the PCA could offer only general resources without hands-on technical assistance.\nThe legitimacy relationship that enabled the subaward became the relationship that masked its limitations. Health center executives, accustomed to trusting the PCA, assumed that support quality matched their historical experience. When transformation assistance proved inadequate, they attributed shortcomings to the complexity of transformation rather than PCA capacity gaps.\nState agency oversight was minimal. The PCA reported activities meeting contractual requirements: technical assistance sessions delivered, webinars conducted, resource materials distributed. The metrics measured effort, not effectiveness. State staff lacked the technical expertise to assess whether PCA behavioral health guidance actually supported integration or merely checked boxes.\nBy year two, implementation delays had accumulated. Health centers that should have launched behavioral health integration remained in planning phases. Telehealth expansion proceeded slower than projected. Workforce pipelines showed limited progress. The PCA’s relationships remained strong, health center trust persisted, but transformation lagged behind what capacity-matched implementation might have achieved.\nThe vignette illustrates the capacity-legitimacy tradeoff. The PCA’s relationships enabled a subaward scope that its organizational capacity could not support. States that prioritize legitimacy over capacity assessment may find that trusted partners cannot deliver trusted results.\nAlternative Perspective: The Capacity Building Argument Critics of capacity-based PCA assessment must contend with the alternative: bypassing PCAs in favor of contractors or consultants without safety-net relationships. This approach trades legitimacy for capacity, potentially losing more than it gains.\nThe strongest version of the capacity building argument holds that RHTP should invest in building PCA capacity rather than routing funding through organizations with capacity but without relationships. PCAs with stronger capacity would serve transformation better in the long run than consultants who disappear when contracts end.\nSeveral states have adopted this approach. Texas combined PCA subawards with dedicated capacity building investments, funding new positions and professional development that expanded PCA transformation capabilities. California used RHTP funding to strengthen PCA technical assistance infrastructure, adding specialists in areas where transformation required expertise the PCA previously lacked.\nThe capacity building approach acknowledges that legitimacy without capacity fails, but argues that capacity without legitimacy fails worse. Consultants who deliver technically sophisticated assistance that health centers distrust or ignore accomplish nothing. PCAs who deliver less sophisticated assistance that health centers accept and implement may achieve more.\nEvidence from early RHTP implementation provides partial support. States that invested in PCA capacity building report improved technical assistance quality over time. Health centers in these states indicate higher satisfaction with transformation support than health centers working with external consultants.\nThe counterargument notes that capacity building takes time transformation timelines may not allow. RHTP operates on a five-year horizon. PCAs that require two years of capacity building before delivering effective transformation support have wasted 40% of the program period. The 2030 funding cliff does not wait for organizational development.\nRHTP Subaward Analysis State approaches to PCA RHTP subawards reflect different assumptions about the capacity-legitimacy balance.\nState Subawardee Award Amount Functions Pass-Through % Capacity Assessment California CPCA $16.4M Workforce, quality, rural expansion 45% Formal capacity review Texas TACHC $12.1M Rural TA, care models 38% Prior performance eval Pennsylvania PACHC $8.3M Quality improvement, workforce 41% Informal assessment Georgia GPCA $7.2M Rural access, integration 35% Limited assessment North Carolina NCCHCA $6.1M Network coordination, TA 33% None documented West Virginia WVPCA $5.8M Transformation support 29% None documented Kentucky KPCA $4.2M Rural TA, workforce 36% None documented Montana MTPCA $3.1M Rural coordination 31% None documented Pass-through percentages for PCAs typically exceed hospital association levels, reflecting PCA emphasis on direct health center support rather than retained administrative services. Higher pass-through means more funding reaches providers, though it also may reflect lower PCA investment in technical assistance infrastructure.\nCapacity assessment practices vary dramatically. California conducted formal organizational capacity reviews before finalizing subaward amounts, adjusting scopes to match demonstrated PCA abilities. Most states conducted no documented capacity assessment, assuming that PCA legitimacy translated to transformation capacity.\nThe absence of capacity assessment creates predictable problems. PCAs receive subawards sized to transformation ambitions rather than organizational realities. When capacity proves insufficient, states face difficult choices: continue funding inadequate implementation, restructure subawards mid-program, or identify alternative intermediaries that may lack PCA relationships.\nThe HRSA Relationship Complexity PCAs operate under HRSA cooperative agreements that create accountability relationships distinct from state RHTP oversight. This dual accountability complicates transformation implementation.\nHRSA expects PCAs to serve all health centers regardless of PCA membership status. PCAs cannot deny technical assistance to non-member health centers or favor members over non-members in training opportunities. This requirement reflects HRSA’s interest in safety-net strengthening broadly, not just for PCA-affiliated health centers.\nRHTP subawards add state accountability without removing HRSA requirements. PCAs must simultaneously satisfy state transformation priorities and HRSA program expectations. When these priorities diverge, PCAs face conflicting demands from their federal funder and state contractor.\nThe Health Center Controlled Network (HCCN) designation adds another layer. Many PCAs serve as both PCA and HCCN, providing health information technology support alongside training and advocacy. HCCN functions receive separate HRSA funding with distinct requirements. RHTP transformation priorities may or may not align with HCCN technology investments.\nThis accountability complexity affects PCA transformation focus. Staff whose positions are funded through HRSA cooperative agreements may resist reassignment to state-funded transformation activities. Organizational energy flows toward activities that satisfy the most demanding funder, which may not be the transformation funder.\nWhen PCAs Help Transformation Despite capacity limitations, PCAs contribute genuine transformation value under specific conditions.\nTechnical assistance on FQHC-specific challenges draws on expertise that general health consultants lack. PCAs understand FQHC governance requirements, HRSA compliance expectations, and community health center operational models. This specialized knowledge enables TA that addresses health center transformation within the regulatory context health centers actually face.\nPeer learning facilitation leverages PCA convening power. When health centers see peers successfully implementing behavioral health integration or telehealth expansion, they become more willing to attempt similar changes. PCAs bring health centers together in ways that build transformation momentum across networks.\nPolicy advocacy for transformation-enabling changes helps remove barriers that individual health centers cannot address. PCAs advocating for Medicaid telehealth reimbursement, scope of practice flexibility, or workforce funding create conditions for transformation that technical assistance alone cannot achieve.\nRelationship-based change management provides emotional support through difficult transitions. Health center executives facing transformation challenges benefit from PCA staff who understand their context, share their values, and can provide encouragement alongside technical guidance. This relational support helps sustain transformation effort through inevitable setbacks and frustrations.\nWhen PCAs Hinder Transformation The same legitimacy that enables PCA value-add can obstruct transformation when capacity proves insufficient.\nOver-promising based on relationship rather than capability creates implementation gaps. PCAs whose legitimacy enables subaward scopes exceeding their capacity may take on transformation responsibilities they cannot fulfill. The West Virginia vignette illustrates consequences: trusted relationships mask inadequate support until transformation timelines have been compromised.\nTechnical assistance diluted by generalist staffing provides guidance without depth. Small PCAs with limited specialized staff deliver TA on behavioral health, telehealth, workforce, and quality improvement through the same generalists. The assistance checks boxes without building health center capability for transformation implementation.\nOrganizational self-preservation competing with transformation priorities diverts resources. PCAs concerned about post-2030 sustainability may focus on activities that secure ongoing funding rather than activities that most effectively advance transformation. Building sustained revenue relationships with health centers may take precedence over pushing health centers toward difficult changes.\nResistance to outcome accountability protects PCA reputation at the cost of transformation transparency. PCAs that report activities rather than outcomes avoid exposing capacity limitations but prevent states from assessing whether PCA involvement actually advances transformation.\nCase Study: Capacity Matching in Practice Colorado’s approach to PCA RHTP involvement illustrates how capacity assessment can improve implementation.\nThe Colorado Community Health Network (CCHN), the state’s PCA, had 26 staff and a $4.1 million budget when Colorado developed its RHTP application. State agency staff conducted explicit capacity assessment before designing PCA roles, reviewing CCHN staffing, technical expertise, program management experience, and historical performance.\nThe assessment identified strengths and gaps. CCHN had strong quality improvement capacity with experienced staff who had successfully supported health center performance initiatives. Workforce development capacity was moderate, with some expertise but limited educational institution relationships. Behavioral health integration capacity was weak, with no staff members having direct behavioral health implementation experience. Telehealth technical assistance capacity was minimal.\nColorado designed subaward scope to match demonstrated capacity. CCHN received a $6.2 million subaward focused on quality improvement coordination and workforce pipeline development where organizational capacity existed. The state contracted separately with behavioral health consultants and telehealth implementation specialists for functions exceeding CCHN capability.\nThis approach sacrificed some legitimacy benefits. Health centers working with external consultants on behavioral health integration lacked the trusted relationship they had with CCHN. Some health center executives expressed preference for working with CCHN even on topics where CCHN lacked expertise. They would rather receive guidance from a trusted partner than superior guidance from a stranger.\nImplementation results supported the capacity-matching approach. Quality improvement initiatives led by CCHN showed strong health center engagement and measurable outcome improvements. Behavioral health integration supported by external consultants progressed faster than in states relying on under-resourced PCAs, despite relationship challenges. Overall transformation achievement exceeded states that prioritized legitimacy over capacity.\nCCHN leadership initially resisted the limited scope, viewing it as a critique of organizational capability. Over time, they recognized benefits. Staff worked within their competencies rather than struggling with unfamiliar content. Health center satisfaction with CCHN support increased because CCHN delivered effectively on committed functions rather than inadequately on overcommitted scope.\nThe Colorado approach requires states to invest in capacity assessment and relationship management with multiple intermediaries. Not all states have the agency capacity for this more complex implementation design. But for states that can manage complexity, capacity matching produces better transformation outcomes than legitimacy-based scope assignment.\nAssessment and Recommendations PCAs occupy an intermediary position where legitimacy and capacity intersect imperfectly. Neither can be ignored; both must be assessed.\nEvidence from RHTP implementation suggests:\nLegitimacy enables transformation conversations that capacity alone cannot initiate. Health centers share information with PCAs, accept PCA guidance, and implement PCA recommendations in ways they do not with external consultants. This legitimacy advantage is real and substantial.\nCapacity gaps constrain what legitimacy enables. PCAs without technical expertise deliver technical assistance that checks boxes without building health center transformation capability. Legitimacy without capacity produces trusted inadequacy.\nMost states have not assessed PCA capacity before assigning RHTP roles. The assumption that legitimacy equals capacity leads to subaward scopes that exceed organizational capability, with consequences visible in implementation delays and transformation shortfalls.\nCapacity building can expand what PCAs deliver, but requires time that transformation timelines may not allow. States must choose between building capacity during implementation (accepting early-period limitations) or matching scope to existing capacity (accepting legitimacy sacrifices for some functions).\nFor State Agencies\nConduct formal capacity assessment before finalizing PCA subaward scope. Review staffing, expertise, program management experience, and historical performance. Match subaward scope to demonstrated capability rather than assumed capability.\nUse complementary intermediaries for functions exceeding PCA capacity. Contract with specialists for technical assistance that PCAs cannot deliver. Accept relationship management complexity as the price of capability-matched implementation.\nInvest in PCA capacity building if transformation timelines allow. Fund new positions, professional development, and infrastructure that expand PCA transformation capability. Recognize that capacity building takes time and adjust expectations accordingly.\nRequire outcome accountability that reveals capacity limitations. Activity metrics that allow inadequate assistance to appear adequate prevent states from identifying problems until transformation timelines have been compromised.\nFor Primary Care Associations\nAcknowledge capacity limitations honestly during subaward negotiations. PCAs that promise more than they can deliver harm health centers and damage long-term credibility. Honest scope negotiation protects PCA reputation and ensures health centers receive effective support.\nInvest in capacity before accepting transformation scope. Build technical expertise, program management infrastructure, and specialized staffing before committing to functions requiring those capabilities. Do not assume that relationship legitimacy compensates for technical inadequacy.\nPartner with specialists for functions exceeding PCA capability. Rather than attempting to deliver behavioral health or telehealth technical assistance without relevant expertise, establish partnerships with organizations that have needed capabilities. Serve as relationship bridge between health centers and technical specialists.\nAccept outcome accountability as necessary for transformation credibility. PCAs that resist outcome measurement appear to prioritize organizational reputation over transformation transparency. Embrace accountability that demonstrates genuine transformation contribution.\nFor CMS\nCoordinate HRSA and state RHTP accountability to avoid conflicting demands. PCAs serving as both HRSA-funded TA providers and state transformation intermediaries face dual accountability that may dilute transformation focus. Clarify how HRSA expectations align with or differ from state transformation priorities.\nSupport PCA capacity assessment tools that states can use for subaward design. Provide benchmarks for PCA capacity by function, enabling states to assess whether specific PCAs can deliver specific transformation support.\nMonitor PCA transformation outcomes across states. Identify capacity patterns that predict transformation success or failure. Share findings to enable state and PCA learning from peer experiences.\nFund HRSA-supported capacity building that complements state transformation investments. Coordinate federal and state capacity building to avoid duplication and maximize PCA development.\nConclusion Primary Care Associations bring irreplaceable legitimacy to RHTP implementation. Health centers trust PCAs, share information with PCAs, and implement PCA guidance in ways that enable transformation conversations other intermediaries cannot initiate. This legitimacy represents decades of relationship investment that states cannot replicate and should not ignore.\nBut legitimacy does not compensate for capacity inadequacy. PCAs without technical expertise, program management experience, and organizational infrastructure cannot deliver transformation support regardless of their relationships. States that assume legitimacy equals capacity assign subaward scopes that exceed PCA capability, producing trusted but inadequate assistance.\nThe path forward requires honest assessment of both legitimacy and capacity. States must evaluate what PCAs can actually deliver, match subaward scope to demonstrated capability, and use complementary intermediaries for functions exceeding PCA capacity. PCAs must acknowledge limitations, invest in capacity development, and partner with specialists rather than over-promising based on relationships alone.\nThe question is not whether PCAs should participate in RHTP implementation. They should. The question is whether states and PCAs will structure participation in ways that leverage legitimacy while respecting capacity constraints. Evidence from early implementation suggests that capacity-matched participation produces better transformation outcomes than legitimacy-based scope assignment that ignores organizational realities.\nCross-References Series 5 (State Agencies): 5A examines lead agency decisions about intermediary selection; 5C covers procurement approaches including PCA subawards Series 7 (Healthcare Providers): 7C assesses FQHC perspectives on PCA value; provider views test whether state-perceived legitimacy translates to experienced support quality Series 3 (State Profiles): California, Texas, Colorado, and West Virginia profiles detail state-specific PCA arrangements and capacity considerations Series 4 (Transformation Approaches): 4D examines community health worker programs where PCAs often serve as training intermediaries; 4G covers behavioral health integration where PCA capacity varies dramatically Sources Arizona Alliance for Community Health Centers. “About AACHC.” AACHC, 2025, aachc.org/about.\nBureau of Primary Health Care. “FY 2025 PCA NCC Progress Report: Sample Staffing Plan.” HRSA, 2025, bphc.hrsa.gov/funding/funding-opportunities/pca/staff-planning.\nBureau of Primary Health Care. “FY25 PCA NCC Frequently Asked Questions.” HRSA, 2025, bphc.hrsa.gov/funding/funding-opportunities/pca/faq.\nBureau of Primary Health Care. “What’s a Primary Care Association (PCA)?” HRSA, 2025, bphc.hrsa.gov/technical-assistance/strategic-partnerships/primary-care-associations.\nCalifornia Primary Care Association. “About CPCA.” CPCA, 2025, cpca.org/about.\nGeorgia Primary Care Association. “About GPCA.” GPCA, 2025, georgiapca.org/about.\nNational Association of Community Health Centers. “Annual Report 2023.” NACHC, 2024, nachc.org/about-nachc/mission/nachc-annual-report-2023.\nNational Association of Community Health Centers. “Directory of PCAs and HCCNs.” NACHC, 2025, nachc.org/state-regional-affiliates-networks/directory-of-pcas-hccns.\nNational Association of Community Health Centers. “Federal Grant Funding.” NACHC, 2025, nachc.org/policy-advocacy/health-center-funding/federal-grant-funding.\nNational Association of Community Health Centers. “Health Center Funding Policy Paper.” NACHC, Dec. 2024, nachc.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/NACHCHealthCenterFundingPolicyPaper_Dec2024_Final.pdf.\nNorth Carolina Community Health Center Association. “Our Programs.” NCCHCA, 2025, ncchca.org/about-us/our-programs.\nPennsylvania Association of Community Health Centers. “About PACHC.” PACHC, 2025, pachc.org/about.\nRHTP Series 6: Intermediary Organizations Rural Health Transformation Project Article 6.B Version 2 January 2026\n",

<p>Primary Care Associations occupy a unique intermediary position in RHTP implementation. <strong>They have legitimacy that hospital associations lack</strong>: decades of relationships with safety-net providers, deep understanding of community health center operations, and credibility built through consistent support. Federally Qualified Health Centers trust their PCAs in ways that enable transformation conversations other intermediaries cannot initiate.</p>
<p>But legitimacy does not equal capacity. PCAs vary enormously in organizational sophistication, ranging from California&rsquo;s 65-person operation with $18 million in annual revenue to states where three-person teams struggle to meet basic HRSA reporting requirements. <strong>The gap between what PCAs are trusted to do and what they can actually deliver shapes RHTP implementation</strong> in ways that state agencies often fail to anticipate.</p>
<p>This article examines the capacity-legitimacy tension that defines PCA involvement in rural health transformation. The question is not whether PCAs should participate, but whether states understand what they are getting when they route transformation funding through organizations whose credibility exceeds their capacity.</p>
<h2 id="the-legitimacy-foundation">The Legitimacy Foundation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-legitimacy-foundation">#</a></h2>
<p>Primary Care Associations have served Federally Qualified Health Centers since the 1970s. Every state and several regions have HRSA-funded PCAs providing training, technical assistance, and advocacy. This sustained presence has built relationships that newer intermediaries cannot match.</p>
<p><strong>FQHC executives trust PCAs because PCAs have delivered for decades.</strong> When new HRSA requirements create compliance challenges, PCAs provide guidance. When health centers face operational difficulties, PCAs offer consulting support. When policy changes threaten the safety net, PCAs advocate. This consistent support creates bonds that transform transactional relationships into genuine partnerships.</p>
<p>The community health center model reinforces PCA credibility. FQHCs serve medically underserved populations through sliding-fee services, community-governed boards, and comprehensive care integration. <strong>Health centers share a mission-driven identity</strong> that distinguishes them from for-profit providers. PCAs speak this language fluently, understanding not just operations but values.</p>
<p>Rural FQHCs and FQHC look-alikes represent a growing share of the safety-net infrastructure serving rural communities. More than 300 health center sites operate in rural designated areas, providing primary care access to populations that might otherwise go without. Many rural communities that have lost hospitals now depend on health centers as their primary healthcare access point.</p>
<p>PCAs understand rural health center challenges distinctly from hospital association perspectives. <strong>Rural FQHCs face workforce constraints, transportation barriers, and population health challenges</strong> that require different approaches than hospital stabilization. PCAs bring this contextual understanding to RHTP conversations.</p>
<p>The trust relationship enables sensitive conversations. FQHC executives share financial concerns, governance challenges, and operational struggles with PCA staff that they would not disclose to state regulators or consultants. <strong>This information sharing enables PCAs to identify problems early</strong> and provide assistance before crises develop.</p>
<h2 id="the-capacity-question">The Capacity Question<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-capacity-question">#</a></h2>
<p>Against this legitimacy advantage, PCA capacity constraints loom large. The 54 state and regional PCAs vary enormously in organizational sophistication.</p>
<p><strong>Staffing levels range from 3 FTEs to more than 60.</strong> The California Primary Care Association maintains substantial teams covering policy, clinical quality, health information technology, workforce, and multiple specialized programs. The Nevada Primary Care Association operates with fewer than 10 staff serving the state&rsquo;s health centers. Both are HRSA-funded PCAs with similar formal responsibilities, but their capacity to deliver differs by an order of magnitude.</p>
<p>Budget disparities compound staffing differences. Large-state PCAs like California, Texas, and New York have annual budgets exceeding $10 million, combining HRSA cooperative agreements with state contracts, foundation grants, and fee-for-service revenues. Small-state PCAs may operate on $1 million or less, relying almost entirely on HRSA funding with minimal additional resources.</p>
<p>Technical expertise varies accordingly. Well-resourced PCAs employ clinical quality specialists, health IT experts, financial analysts, and workforce development coordinators. Smaller PCAs rely on generalists who cover multiple functions without deep expertise in any. <strong>When RHTP requires sophisticated technical assistance, PCAs without relevant expertise cannot deliver regardless of their legitimacy.</strong></p>
<p>Many PCAs have never managed transformation programs at RHTP scale. HRSA cooperative agreements fund training, technical assistance, and advocacy, not major capital investments or system redesign. PCAs accustomed to supporting health centers through regulatory compliance and quality improvement may lack experience guiding fundamental operational transformation.</p>
<h2 id="pca-and-network-landscape">PCA and Network Landscape<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#pca-and-network-landscape">#</a></h2>
<p>The following table illustrates capacity variation across PCAs receiving RHTP-related funding:</p>

<p><strong>Capacity levels reflect overall organizational ability to deliver complex transformation support</strong>, considering staffing, budget, technical expertise, and demonstrated program management experience. High-capacity PCAs can manage sophisticated multi-year transformation initiatives. Low-capacity PCAs struggle to deliver technical assistance beyond basic compliance support.</p>
<p>The subaward amounts often exceed what PCA capacity can effectively deploy. Nevada&rsquo;s PCA, with 6 staff and $1.4 million budget, received $2 million in RHTP subaward that nearly doubled its organizational resources. <strong>Managing subawards larger than the organization&rsquo;s existing budget strains administrative systems</strong> and diverts attention from core functions.</p>
<h2 id="case-study-the-capacity-gap-in-action">Case Study: The Capacity Gap in Action<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#case-study-the-capacity-gap-in-action">#</a></h2>
<p>The Appalachian Community Health Initiative (name changed) illustrates how PCA legitimacy can mask capacity limitations with consequences for transformation implementation.</p>
<p>The West Virginia Primary Care Association had served the state&rsquo;s health centers for 28 years when RHTP implementation began. With 14 staff and a $2.3 million budget, the PCA maintained strong relationships with West Virginia&rsquo;s 31 FQHCs. <strong>Health center executives trusted the PCA implicitly</strong>, seeking guidance on everything from HRSA compliance to strategic planning.</p>
<p>West Virginia&rsquo;s RHTP application designated the PCA as lead intermediary for safety-net transformation, with a $5.8 million subaward over three years. The transformation scope included care model redesign, behavioral health integration, telehealth expansion, and workforce pipeline development. <strong>The subaward represented 2.5 times the PCA&rsquo;s existing annual budget.</strong></p>
<p>The first year revealed capacity gaps. The PCA had no staff with behavioral health integration expertise, despite this being a major transformation priority. Telehealth technical assistance fell to a generalist who had never implemented telehealth systems. Workforce pipeline coordination required relationships with educational institutions that the PCA had not cultivated.</p>
<p>The PCA responded by hiring, but hiring proved difficult. <strong>Rural West Virginia is not an attractive labor market for health policy professionals.</strong> After nine months, the PCA had filled only two of five new positions, both with candidates requiring substantial onboarding before they could deliver technical assistance.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, health centers expected transformation support that the PCA could not provide. Cabin Creek Health Center wanted guidance on integrating psychiatric services into primary care, but the PCA&rsquo;s behavioral health consultant had started only two months earlier and was still learning the state landscape. Minnie Hamilton Health System sought telehealth implementation support, but the PCA could offer only general resources without hands-on technical assistance.</p>
<p><strong>The legitimacy relationship that enabled the subaward became the relationship that masked its limitations.</strong> Health center executives, accustomed to trusting the PCA, assumed that support quality matched their historical experience. When transformation assistance proved inadequate, they attributed shortcomings to the complexity of transformation rather than PCA capacity gaps.</p>
<p>State agency oversight was minimal. The PCA reported activities meeting contractual requirements: technical assistance sessions delivered, webinars conducted, resource materials distributed. <strong>The metrics measured effort, not effectiveness.</strong> State staff lacked the technical expertise to assess whether PCA behavioral health guidance actually supported integration or merely checked boxes.</p>
<p>By year two, implementation delays had accumulated. Health centers that should have launched behavioral health integration remained in planning phases. Telehealth expansion proceeded slower than projected. Workforce pipelines showed limited progress. The PCA&rsquo;s relationships remained strong, health center trust persisted, but <strong>transformation lagged behind what capacity-matched implementation might have achieved.</strong></p>
<p>The vignette illustrates the capacity-legitimacy tradeoff. The PCA&rsquo;s relationships enabled a subaward scope that its organizational capacity could not support. States that prioritize legitimacy over capacity assessment may find that trusted partners cannot deliver trusted results.</p>
<h2 id="alternative-perspective-the-capacity-building-argument">Alternative Perspective: The Capacity Building Argument<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#alternative-perspective-the-capacity-building-argument">#</a></h2>
<p>Critics of capacity-based PCA assessment must contend with the alternative: bypassing PCAs in favor of contractors or consultants without safety-net relationships. This approach trades legitimacy for capacity, potentially losing more than it gains.</p>
<p><strong>The strongest version of the capacity building argument holds that RHTP should invest in building PCA capacity</strong> rather than routing funding through organizations with capacity but without relationships. PCAs with stronger capacity would serve transformation better in the long run than consultants who disappear when contracts end.</p>
<p>Several states have adopted this approach. Texas combined PCA subawards with dedicated capacity building investments, funding new positions and professional development that expanded PCA transformation capabilities. California used RHTP funding to strengthen PCA technical assistance infrastructure, adding specialists in areas where transformation required expertise the PCA previously lacked.</p>
<p>The capacity building approach acknowledges that legitimacy without capacity fails, but argues that <strong>capacity without legitimacy fails worse</strong>. Consultants who deliver technically sophisticated assistance that health centers distrust or ignore accomplish nothing. PCAs who deliver less sophisticated assistance that health centers accept and implement may achieve more.</p>
<p>Evidence from early RHTP implementation provides partial support. States that invested in PCA capacity building report improved technical assistance quality over time. Health centers in these states indicate higher satisfaction with transformation support than health centers working with external consultants.</p>
<p><strong>The counterargument notes that capacity building takes time transformation timelines may not allow.</strong> RHTP operates on a five-year horizon. PCAs that require two years of capacity building before delivering effective transformation support have wasted 40% of the program period. The 2030 funding cliff does not wait for organizational development.</p>

<p><strong>Pass-through percentages for PCAs typically exceed hospital association levels</strong>, reflecting PCA emphasis on direct health center support rather than retained administrative services. Higher pass-through means more funding reaches providers, though it also may reflect lower PCA investment in technical assistance infrastructure.</p>
<p>Capacity assessment practices vary dramatically. California conducted formal organizational capacity reviews before finalizing subaward amounts, adjusting scopes to match demonstrated PCA abilities. <strong>Most states conducted no documented capacity assessment</strong>, assuming that PCA legitimacy translated to transformation capacity.</p>
<p>The absence of capacity assessment creates predictable problems. PCAs receive subawards sized to transformation ambitions rather than organizational realities. When capacity proves insufficient, states face difficult choices: continue funding inadequate implementation, restructure subawards mid-program, or identify alternative intermediaries that may lack PCA relationships.</p>
<h2 id="the-hrsa-relationship-complexity">The HRSA Relationship Complexity<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-hrsa-relationship-complexity">#</a></h2>
<p>PCAs operate under HRSA cooperative agreements that create accountability relationships distinct from state RHTP oversight. This dual accountability complicates transformation implementation.</p>
<p><strong>HRSA expects PCAs to serve all health centers regardless of PCA membership status.</strong> PCAs cannot deny technical assistance to non-member health centers or favor members over non-members in training opportunities. This requirement reflects HRSA&rsquo;s interest in safety-net strengthening broadly, not just for PCA-affiliated health centers.</p>
<p>RHTP subawards add state accountability without removing HRSA requirements. PCAs must simultaneously satisfy state transformation priorities and HRSA program expectations. When these priorities diverge, <strong>PCAs face conflicting demands from their federal funder and state contractor.</strong></p>
<p>The Health Center Controlled Network (HCCN) designation adds another layer. Many PCAs serve as both PCA and HCCN, providing health information technology support alongside training and advocacy. HCCN functions receive separate HRSA funding with distinct requirements. RHTP transformation priorities may or may not align with HCCN technology investments.</p>
<p>This accountability complexity affects PCA transformation focus. Staff whose positions are funded through HRSA cooperative agreements may resist reassignment to state-funded transformation activities. <strong>Organizational energy flows toward activities that satisfy the most demanding funder</strong>, which may not be the transformation funder.</p>
<h2 id="when-pcas-help-transformation">When PCAs Help Transformation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#when-pcas-help-transformation">#</a></h2>
<p>Despite capacity limitations, PCAs contribute genuine transformation value under specific conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Technical assistance on FQHC-specific challenges</strong> draws on expertise that general health consultants lack. PCAs understand FQHC governance requirements, HRSA compliance expectations, and community health center operational models. This specialized knowledge enables TA that addresses health center transformation within the regulatory context health centers actually face.</p>
<p><strong>Peer learning facilitation</strong> leverages PCA convening power. When health centers see peers successfully implementing behavioral health integration or telehealth expansion, they become more willing to attempt similar changes. PCAs bring health centers together in ways that build transformation momentum across networks.</p>
<p><strong>Policy advocacy for transformation-enabling changes</strong> helps remove barriers that individual health centers cannot address. PCAs advocating for Medicaid telehealth reimbursement, scope of practice flexibility, or workforce funding create conditions for transformation that technical assistance alone cannot achieve.</p>
<p><strong>Relationship-based change management</strong> provides emotional support through difficult transitions. Health center executives facing transformation challenges benefit from PCA staff who understand their context, share their values, and can provide encouragement alongside technical guidance. <strong>This relational support helps sustain transformation effort</strong> through inevitable setbacks and frustrations.</p>
<h2 id="when-pcas-hinder-transformation">When PCAs Hinder Transformation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#when-pcas-hinder-transformation">#</a></h2>
<p>The same legitimacy that enables PCA value-add can obstruct transformation when capacity proves insufficient.</p>
<p><strong>Over-promising based on relationship rather than capability</strong> creates implementation gaps. PCAs whose legitimacy enables subaward scopes exceeding their capacity may take on transformation responsibilities they cannot fulfill. The West Virginia vignette illustrates consequences: trusted relationships mask inadequate support until transformation timelines have been compromised.</p>
<p><strong>Technical assistance diluted by generalist staffing</strong> provides guidance without depth. Small PCAs with limited specialized staff deliver TA on behavioral health, telehealth, workforce, and quality improvement through the same generalists. <strong>The assistance checks boxes without building health center capability</strong> for transformation implementation.</p>
<p><strong>Organizational self-preservation competing with transformation priorities</strong> diverts resources. PCAs concerned about post-2030 sustainability may focus on activities that secure ongoing funding rather than activities that most effectively advance transformation. Building sustained revenue relationships with health centers may take precedence over pushing health centers toward difficult changes.</p>
<p><strong>Resistance to outcome accountability</strong> protects PCA reputation at the cost of transformation transparency. PCAs that report activities rather than outcomes avoid exposing capacity limitations but prevent states from assessing whether PCA involvement actually advances transformation.</p>
<h2 id="case-study-capacity-matching-in-practice">Case Study: Capacity Matching in Practice<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#case-study-capacity-matching-in-practice">#</a></h2>
<p>Colorado&rsquo;s approach to PCA RHTP involvement illustrates how capacity assessment can improve implementation.</p>
<p>The Colorado Community Health Network (CCHN), the state&rsquo;s PCA, had 26 staff and a $4.1 million budget when Colorado developed its RHTP application. <strong>State agency staff conducted explicit capacity assessment</strong> before designing PCA roles, reviewing CCHN staffing, technical expertise, program management experience, and historical performance.</p>
<p>The assessment identified strengths and gaps. CCHN had strong quality improvement capacity with experienced staff who had successfully supported health center performance initiatives. Workforce development capacity was moderate, with some expertise but limited educational institution relationships. Behavioral health integration capacity was weak, with no staff members having direct behavioral health implementation experience. Telehealth technical assistance capacity was minimal.</p>
<p><strong>Colorado designed subaward scope to match demonstrated capacity.</strong> CCHN received a $6.2 million subaward focused on quality improvement coordination and workforce pipeline development where organizational capacity existed. The state contracted separately with behavioral health consultants and telehealth implementation specialists for functions exceeding CCHN capability.</p>
<p>This approach sacrificed some legitimacy benefits. Health centers working with external consultants on behavioral health integration lacked the trusted relationship they had with CCHN. <strong>Some health center executives expressed preference for working with CCHN even on topics where CCHN lacked expertise.</strong> They would rather receive guidance from a trusted partner than superior guidance from a stranger.</p>
<p>Implementation results supported the capacity-matching approach. Quality improvement initiatives led by CCHN showed strong health center engagement and measurable outcome improvements. Behavioral health integration supported by external consultants progressed faster than in states relying on under-resourced PCAs, despite relationship challenges. <strong>Overall transformation achievement exceeded states that prioritized legitimacy over capacity.</strong></p>
<p>CCHN leadership initially resisted the limited scope, viewing it as a critique of organizational capability. Over time, they recognized benefits. Staff worked within their competencies rather than struggling with unfamiliar content. <strong>Health center satisfaction with CCHN support increased</strong> because CCHN delivered effectively on committed functions rather than inadequately on overcommitted scope.</p>
<p>The Colorado approach requires states to invest in capacity assessment and relationship management with multiple intermediaries. Not all states have the agency capacity for this more complex implementation design. But for states that can manage complexity, capacity matching produces better transformation outcomes than legitimacy-based scope assignment.</p>
<h2 id="assessment-and-recommendations">Assessment and Recommendations<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#assessment-and-recommendations">#</a></h2>
<p>PCAs occupy an intermediary position where legitimacy and capacity intersect imperfectly. <strong>Neither can be ignored</strong>; both must be assessed.</p>
<p>Evidence from RHTP implementation suggests:</p>
<p>Legitimacy enables transformation conversations that capacity alone cannot initiate. Health centers share information with PCAs, accept PCA guidance, and implement PCA recommendations in ways they do not with external consultants. <strong>This legitimacy advantage is real and substantial.</strong></p>
<p>Capacity gaps constrain what legitimacy enables. PCAs without technical expertise deliver technical assistance that checks boxes without building health center transformation capability. <strong>Legitimacy without capacity produces trusted inadequacy.</strong></p>
<p>Most states have not assessed PCA capacity before assigning RHTP roles. The assumption that legitimacy equals capacity leads to subaward scopes that exceed organizational capability, with consequences visible in implementation delays and transformation shortfalls.</p>
<p>Capacity building can expand what PCAs deliver, but requires time that transformation timelines may not allow. States must choose between building capacity during implementation (accepting early-period limitations) or matching scope to existing capacity (accepting legitimacy sacrifices for some functions).</p>
<p><strong>For State Agencies</strong></p>
<p>Conduct formal capacity assessment before finalizing PCA subaward scope. Review staffing, expertise, program management experience, and historical performance. Match subaward scope to demonstrated capability rather than assumed capability.</p>
<p>Use complementary intermediaries for functions exceeding PCA capacity. Contract with specialists for technical assistance that PCAs cannot deliver. Accept relationship management complexity as the price of capability-matched implementation.</p>
<p>Invest in PCA capacity building if transformation timelines allow. Fund new positions, professional development, and infrastructure that expand PCA transformation capability. Recognize that capacity building takes time and adjust expectations accordingly.</p>
<p>Require outcome accountability that reveals capacity limitations. Activity metrics that allow inadequate assistance to appear adequate prevent states from identifying problems until transformation timelines have been compromised.</p>
<p><strong>For Primary Care Associations</strong></p>
<p>Acknowledge capacity limitations honestly during subaward negotiations. PCAs that promise more than they can deliver harm health centers and damage long-term credibility. Honest scope negotiation protects PCA reputation and ensures health centers receive effective support.</p>
<p>Invest in capacity before accepting transformation scope. Build technical expertise, program management infrastructure, and specialized staffing before committing to functions requiring those capabilities. Do not assume that relationship legitimacy compensates for technical inadequacy.</p>
<p>Partner with specialists for functions exceeding PCA capability. Rather than attempting to deliver behavioral health or telehealth technical assistance without relevant expertise, establish partnerships with organizations that have needed capabilities. <strong>Serve as relationship bridge</strong> between health centers and technical specialists.</p>
<p>Accept outcome accountability as necessary for transformation credibility. PCAs that resist outcome measurement appear to prioritize organizational reputation over transformation transparency. Embrace accountability that demonstrates genuine transformation contribution.</p>
<p><strong>For CMS</strong></p>
<p>Coordinate HRSA and state RHTP accountability to avoid conflicting demands. PCAs serving as both HRSA-funded TA providers and state transformation intermediaries face dual accountability that may dilute transformation focus. Clarify how HRSA expectations align with or differ from state transformation priorities.</p>
<p>Support PCA capacity assessment tools that states can use for subaward design. Provide benchmarks for PCA capacity by function, enabling states to assess whether specific PCAs can deliver specific transformation support.</p>
<p>Monitor PCA transformation outcomes across states. Identify capacity patterns that predict transformation success or failure. Share findings to enable state and PCA learning from peer experiences.</p>
<p>Fund HRSA-supported capacity building that complements state transformation investments. Coordinate federal and state capacity building to avoid duplication and maximize PCA development.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>Primary Care Associations bring irreplaceable legitimacy to RHTP implementation. Health centers trust PCAs, share information with PCAs, and implement PCA guidance in ways that enable transformation conversations other intermediaries cannot initiate. <strong>This legitimacy represents decades of relationship investment</strong> that states cannot replicate and should not ignore.</p>
<p>But legitimacy does not compensate for capacity inadequacy. PCAs without technical expertise, program management experience, and organizational infrastructure cannot deliver transformation support regardless of their relationships. <strong>States that assume legitimacy equals capacity</strong> assign subaward scopes that exceed PCA capability, producing trusted but inadequate assistance.</p>
<p>The path forward requires honest assessment of both legitimacy and capacity. States must evaluate what PCAs can actually deliver, match subaward scope to demonstrated capability, and use complementary intermediaries for functions exceeding PCA capacity. PCAs must acknowledge limitations, invest in capacity development, and partner with specialists rather than over-promising based on relationships alone.</p>
<p>The question is not whether PCAs should participate in RHTP implementation. They should. <strong>The question is whether states and PCAs will structure participation in ways that leverage legitimacy while respecting capacity constraints.</strong> Evidence from early implementation suggests that capacity-matched participation produces better transformation outcomes than legitimacy-based scope assignment that ignores organizational realities.</p>
