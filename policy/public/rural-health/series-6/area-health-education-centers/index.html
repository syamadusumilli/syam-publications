  "articleBody": "Area Health Education Centers face a fundamental tension between incumbent infrastructure and insurgent necessity. AHECs have built relationships, developed programs, and coordinated clinical training for over fifty years. This infrastructure represents a substantial asset: established connections with academic health centers, networks of clinical training sites, educational programming expertise, and community relationships that take decades to develop.\nThe insurgent question is uncomfortable but essential: Rural workforce shortages persist despite fifty years of AHEC activity. If current approaches had solved the problem, the problem would be solved. It is not. This raises difficult questions about whether RHTP investment should expand proven infrastructure or support alternative approaches that might achieve what incumbents have not.\nAHEC programs reach 685,095 participants annually through 300+ centers nationwide (National AHEC Organization). This represents substantial activity. Whether that activity translates to rural workforce adequacy is the question RHTP implementation must address.\nThe Incumbent Infrastructure The AHEC program traces to 1972 federal legislation designed to address geographic maldistribution of healthcare providers. Over five decades, this investment has built substantial infrastructure:\n56 AHEC programs operate across states and territories, typically housed within academic health centers with federal HRSA support supplemented by state and institutional funding. These programs coordinate with medical schools, nursing programs, and allied health training to place students in community-based clinical experiences.\n300+ regional AHEC centers extend academic reach into communities. These centers, distributed across urban and rural areas, maintain relationships with clinical training sites, coordinate student placements, and deliver community health education programming. The distributed structure theoretically enables academic programs to access training sites they could not coordinate independently.\nClinical rotation coordination represents the core function. Health professions students require supervised clinical experiences before entering practice. Rural areas often lack teaching hospitals and academic faculty. AHECs bridge this gap by identifying community preceptors, coordinating placements, and supporting preceptor development. Without this coordination, rural clinical training sites might not participate in health professions education.\nPipeline programs target future health professionals. Many AHECs operate programs introducing high school students to health careers, with particular focus on students from rural backgrounds. The theory: students from rural communities more likely choose rural practice. Pipeline programs aim to expand the pool of rural-origin health professions students.\nContinuing education supports practicing providers. Rural practitioners often lack access to professional development available to urban colleagues. AHECs provide continuing education programming that helps rural providers maintain competence and licensure without traveling to urban training centers.\nThis infrastructure represents genuine assets. Relationships with academic health centers take years to develop. Preceptor networks require cultivation. Community presence builds trust. RHTP implementation should not dismiss these assets casually.\nThe Insurgent Question The uncomfortable question remains: Why do rural workforce shortages persist after fifty years of AHEC investment?\nPrimary care shortages span most rural counties. 85 million Americans live in primary care Health Professional Shortage Areas, with rural areas disproportionately represented (HRSA). Nursing shortages threaten rural hospital viability. Mental health provider availability in rural areas is approximately one-fifth of urban levels. Dental access remains severely limited.\nIf AHEC programs effectively address rural workforce maldistribution, these shortages should have diminished over five decades. They have not. This persistence raises several possibilities:\nThe problem may exceed AHEC capacity. Workforce distribution reflects factors including compensation differentials, community amenities, professional isolation, spouse employment, and educational opportunities for children. AHECs address training exposure but cannot change the economic and social factors that drive practice location decisions. The problem may simply be larger than the solution.\nCurrent approaches may have reached their effectiveness ceiling. Pipeline programs, clinical rotations, and continuing education represent established strategies. These strategies may produce incremental benefit without achieving transformation. Doing more of what has not solved the problem may not solve the problem.\nTraining volume may not equal retention outcomes. AHECs track students exposed to rural training and providers completing continuing education. They less consistently track whether rural-trained students enter rural practice, whether they remain after loan repayment obligations expire, and whether educational interventions affect long-term career decisions.\nIncumbent mental models may constrain innovation. Organizations develop expertise in their established approaches. AHEC expertise centers on academic partnerships, clinical rotation coordination, and educational programming. Alternative approaches, such as apprenticeship models, community-based hiring, or non-traditional training pathways, may fall outside organizational competence and comfort.\nAHEC Landscape The following table examines AHEC programs across states with significant RHTP investment to illustrate variation in organizational capacity and demonstrated outcomes:\nAHEC Program State Regional Centers Training Sites Annual Trainees RHTP Role Subaward Retention Evidence NC AHEC North Carolina 9 2,800+ 12,400+ Workforce pipeline $9.2M Strong tracking Texas AHEC Texas 9 1,400+ 8,200+ Rural rotations $7.8M Moderate tracking California AHEC California 12 1,100+ 6,800+ Primary care pipeline $6.4M Limited tracking Ohio AHEC Ohio 7 640+ 4,200+ Appalachian focus $5.1M Moderate tracking Alabama AHEC Alabama 5 380+ 2,800+ Black Belt targeting $4.6M Limited tracking Kentucky AHEC Kentucky 8 520+ 3,400+ Eastern Kentucky $4.2M Moderate tracking Georgia AHEC Georgia 5 440+ 2,600+ Rural rotations $3.8M Limited tracking North Dakota AHEC North Dakota 2 180+ 1,200+ Statewide rural $2.4M Strong tracking Capacity varies significantly. North Carolina’s mature program with nine regional centers and 2,800+ training sites represents different capability than North Dakota’s two-center program serving a smaller population. RHTP subaward scope should reflect actual organizational capacity.\nRetention tracking, the outcome that matters most, remains inconsistent. Some programs systematically follow trainees to assess whether rural exposure translates to rural practice. Others track training volume without connecting to practice location outcomes. Without retention data, training effectiveness remains unknown.\nDecision Scenario: The Innovation Dilemma A Midwestern state designed its RHTP workforce component with $6.8 million designated for pipeline and training support. The state AHEC submitted a proposal expanding existing programs: enhanced rural rotations, additional pipeline activities, more preceptor development, and expanded continuing education.\nA community-based organization proposed an alternative approach. The organization, rooted in rural communities the state targeted for workforce development, proposed a model based on local hiring and apprenticeship. Rather than recruiting students from elsewhere and exposing them to rural training, the model identified individuals already living in rural communities and supported their progression into healthcare careers through stackable credentials, employer-based training, and community support systems.\nThe proposals represented fundamentally different theories of change. The AHEC proposal assumed that exposing health professions students to rural communities during training would influence their eventual practice location choices. The community organization assumed that individuals already rooted in rural communities were more likely to remain if supported through training pathways that did not require them to leave.\nThe state faced an uncomfortable choice. The AHEC had established infrastructure, academic partnerships, and decades of experience. The community organization had community relationships but limited track record in workforce development at scale. Choosing the AHEC meant investing in proven infrastructure with unproven outcomes. Choosing the community organization meant risking proven infrastructure for potentially superior but untested innovation.\nThe state chose a compromise that satisfied neither theory of change. It awarded $5.2 million to the AHEC for expanded traditional programming and $1.6 million to the community organization for a pilot project. The AHEC interpreted this as validation of its approach. The community organization received insufficient funding to demonstrate its model at meaningful scale.\nYear two evaluation revealed expected patterns. The AHEC reported impressive activity metrics: more rural rotations, more continuing education sessions, more pipeline participants. The community organization struggled with limited resources but showed promising early indicators: participants who completed training remained in their communities because they had never left.\nThe workforce shortage remained unchanged. Neither investment at the allocated scale could transform rural workforce availability within RHTP timelines. But the state never learned whether the alternative approach could outperform traditional models because the funding allocation prevented fair comparison.\nDecision Scenario: The Preceptor Bottleneck New Hampshire’s AHEC identified clinical placement capacity as the binding constraint on rural workforce development. The state’s health professions programs could admit more students. Loan repayment programs could incentivize more rural practice. But the limiting factor was preceptors: experienced practitioners willing and able to supervise students in clinical settings.\nRural preceptors face particular challenges. They typically lack teaching faculty appointments and the protected time those appointments provide. They receive minimal compensation for teaching activities. Adding students to clinical workflows reduces productivity and income. The administrative burden of documentation and evaluation competes with patient care demands.\nThe AHEC proposed a preceptor support initiative using RHTP funding. The proposal included stipends for rural preceptors, reduced documentation burden through streamlined evaluation processes, faculty development programming, and recognition systems to acknowledge teaching contributions. The goal: expand rural clinical placement capacity by making precepting more attractive and sustainable.\nImplementation revealed deeper issues. Stipends helped but did not address time constraints. Reduced documentation required academic partner cooperation that proved difficult to achieve. Faculty development required preceptors to take additional time away from practice. Recognition was appreciated but did not change fundamental economic calculations.\nThe preceptor supply increased modestly but did not transform. Stipends attracted some new preceptors and retained some who might have stopped. But the fundamental tension between teaching and productivity remained. Preceptors willing to accept reduced income for teaching satisfaction already precepted. Those unwilling to accept that tradeoff found stipends insufficient to change their calculation.\nThe AHEC succeeded in its defined objectives while failing to solve the underlying problem. More preceptors participated. More students completed rural rotations. But the bottleneck remained because the intervention addressed symptoms rather than root causes. The economic structure of rural practice made teaching a sacrifice. Modest compensation reduced but did not eliminate that sacrifice.\nThe Evidence Question Understanding AHEC effectiveness requires examining available evidence carefully. The evidence base is extensive for activities and limited for outcomes.\nSubstantial evidence documents AHEC activities. Programs track students completing rural rotations, continuing education participants, pipeline program enrollment, and preceptor engagement. This activity data demonstrates that AHECs do things. Whether those things produce intended outcomes requires different evidence.\nLimited evidence connects AHEC exposure to practice location. Some studies find association between rural training exposure and eventual rural practice. But association does not establish causation. Students who choose rural rotations may already be predisposed to rural practice. The rotation may confirm rather than create their inclination.\nRural origin consistently predicts rural practice more strongly than training exposure. Students from rural backgrounds choose rural practice at higher rates than urban-origin students exposed to rural training. This finding suggests that recruitment strategy may matter more than educational intervention. Expanding the pool of rural-origin health professions students might outperform exposing urban-origin students to rural experiences.\nRetention data remains scarce. Following graduates for years into their careers requires longitudinal tracking that most AHEC programs do not conduct. Without retention data, programs cannot distinguish between short-term placement and long-term practice. A physician who takes a rural position for loan repayment and leaves after three years contributes differently than one who practices rurally for a career. Training programs rarely track these distinctions.\nComparison groups are rarely established. Evaluating AHEC effectiveness requires comparing outcomes for students with and without AHEC exposure. Without comparison groups, programs cannot determine whether observed outcomes result from intervention or would have occurred regardless.\nThe evidence question has practical implications for RHTP investment. States should require outcome evidence, not just activity evidence, before committing significant funding to AHEC expansion. Where outcome evidence is unavailable, states should require its collection as a condition of continued funding.\nThe AHEC Scholars Model The AHEC Scholars Program represents a national initiative designed to enhance rural and underserved workforce development through structured training experiences. Understanding its design illuminates both AHEC strengths and limitations.\nThe program combines didactic training with clinical experience. Students complete 40+ hours of community-based training and educational modules covering team-based care, social determinants of health, cultural competency, and practice transformation. This combination addresses critique that clinical rotations alone lack contextual education.\nInterdisciplinary training brings students from different professions together. Physicians, nurses, pharmacists, social workers, and other health professionals train alongside each other, modeling the team-based approaches that rural practice requires. This interprofessional element distinguishes AHEC Scholars from standard clinical rotations.\nStipends support participation. Students receive up to $1,600 over one to two years, partially offsetting opportunity costs of extended community-based training. Stipends enable participation by students who might otherwise choose more remunerative alternatives.\nThe program emphasizes underrepresented populations. Recruitment focuses on minority, disadvantaged, rural-origin, and first-generation college students. This targeting addresses evidence that background predicts practice location.\nOutcome tracking remains limited. The program collects data on participant characteristics and training completion. Tracking whether AHEC Scholars choose rural practice at higher rates than non-participants, and whether they remain longer, requires longitudinal follow-up that is beginning but not yet mature.\nThe AHEC Scholars model represents AHEC infrastructure at its most sophisticated. Whether that sophistication translates to outcomes that justify investment remains an open question awaiting evidence.\nAlternative Perspective: The Transformation Impossibility View Some observers argue that AHECs cannot solve rural workforce shortages because the shortages reflect structural factors beyond educational intervention. This impossibility view merits examination.\nTraining capacity is limited by GME slots, not AHEC programs. Physician supply depends primarily on residency positions funded by Medicare. AHECs can expose students to rural settings but cannot increase the total number of physicians trained. If the pipeline constraint is GME funding, AHEC investment addresses a non-binding constraint.\nRural retention depends on community factors, not educational interventions. Research consistently shows that rural-origin students more frequently choose rural practice than urban-origin students exposed to rural training. If origin matters more than exposure, pipeline programs targeting existing students may have less impact than recruitment strategies targeting rural communities.\nCompensation differentials exceed what education can overcome. Specialist physicians earn substantially more than primary care physicians. Urban practice often pays more than rural practice. If financial factors drive location decisions, educational interventions cannot compete with economic incentives.\nAssessment: This view is partially valid but overstated. AHECs genuinely cannot solve workforce shortages alone. They cannot increase GME slots, change compensation differentials, or transform community amenities. But they can contribute to solutions as part of broader strategies. Rural rotation experiences do influence some students’ practice decisions. Pipeline programs do expand the rural-origin student pool. Continuing education does support rural provider retention.\nThe impossibility view correctly identifies AHEC limitations. It incorrectly concludes that those limitations render AHEC investment valueless. The appropriate conclusion is that AHECs contribute to workforce solutions without providing complete solutions. RHTP should calibrate expectations accordingly.\nRHTP Subaward Analysis AHEC subawards reveal consistent patterns requiring attention:\nProgram expansion dominates over innovation. Most AHEC proposals request funding to do more of what they already do: more rotations, more pipeline activities, more continuing education. Proposals for fundamentally different approaches rarely emerge from incumbent organizations whose expertise and identity center on established methods.\nPipeline metrics emphasize exposure over outcome. Subawards measure students completing rural rotations, high schoolers participating in health career programs, and providers attending continuing education. They rarely require tracking whether rotations predict rural practice, whether pipeline participants enter health professions, or whether continuing education affects retention.\nAcademic partnerships shape priorities. AHECs exist within academic health center structures. Their priorities reflect academic calendars, credentialing requirements, and institutional relationships. Community needs may receive attention, but academic structures constrain flexibility.\nPass-through to communities varies significantly. Some AHECs function as coordinating entities directing resources to community-based training sites and preceptors. Others retain most funding for programmatic infrastructure with limited community pass-through. The appropriate balance depends on specific state contexts.\nRetention accountability remains rare. RHTP success requires providers practicing in rural communities, not students completing rural training. AHECs track the latter because they control it. They rarely track the former because it requires following graduates for years after program completion into practice decisions AHEC cannot influence.\nWhen AHECs Help Transformation AHECs contribute genuine value under specific conditions:\nStates with strong academic health center partnerships. Where medical schools, nursing programs, and allied health training actively partner with AHEC networks, the coordination infrastructure adds clear value. Students need clinical placements. Rural communities need students. AHECs bridge this gap.\nIntegration with other workforce strategies. AHECs alone cannot solve workforce shortages. AHECs coordinated with loan repayment, immigration visa programs, telehealth expansion, and scope of practice reform contribute to comprehensive approaches. The coordination role leverages AHEC relationships and expertise.\nFocus on retention, not just training. Programs tracking whether rural-trained students enter and remain in rural practice can demonstrate impact. Programs measuring only training exposure cannot. AHECs willing to accept retention accountability provide more credible evidence of value.\nAdaptation to rural community needs. Traditional health professions education follows established pathways: degree programs, clinical rotations, licensure examinations. Some rural communities need workforce development that follows different pathways: stackable credentials, employer-based training, community health worker certification. AHECs willing to support non-traditional approaches expand their value beyond academic coordination.\nPreceptor network maintenance in underserved areas. Clinical training requires supervised experience. In areas with few practitioners, each preceptor matters. AHECs that cultivate and support preceptor networks maintain infrastructure that individual training programs cannot sustain independently.\nThe Community Health Worker Question One area where AHEC incumbent status may most constrain innovation involves community health workers and other non-traditional workforce categories. CHWs represent a growing workforce development strategy that does not fit traditional AHEC models.\nCommunity health workers typically emerge from communities they serve. Unlike physicians and nurses trained through academic pathways, CHWs often enter healthcare through community organizations, receive training through non-academic programs, and hold certifications rather than professional licenses.\nAHEC expertise centers on academic health professions. Programs coordinate with medical schools, nursing programs, and allied health training. They have less experience with community-based workforce development that does not require academic credentials.\nSome AHECs have expanded to include CHW programming. These programs recognize that rural workforce needs extend beyond traditional providers. But expansion into new workforce categories requires organizational adaptation that incumbent structures may resist.\nAlternative organizations may have comparative advantage for CHW development. Community-based organizations with deep community relationships, cultural competence, and experience with non-academic training may produce CHW outcomes that AHECs cannot match.\nThe question is not whether AHECs can participate in CHW development. Many can. The question is whether AHEC participation adds value or whether resources directed to CHW development through AHECs would produce better outcomes if directed through community-based alternatives. RHTP implementation should test this question rather than assume that AHEC participation in all workforce categories adds value.\nGeographic and Cultural Considerations AHEC effectiveness likely varies by geography and culture in ways that aggregate program data obscure.\nStates with concentrated rural populations may differ from those with dispersed rural populations. North Carolina’s AHEC with nine regional centers can maintain presence across the state’s rural areas. Montana’s or Alaska’s vast distances create different challenges that centralized AHEC models may not address effectively.\nCultural competence requirements vary regionally. AHECs serving tribal communities need different capabilities than those serving Appalachian populations or Delta communities. Academic health center partnerships may not provide the cultural competence that specific communities require.\nEconomic contexts differ. Rural communities with resource extraction economies face different workforce challenges than agricultural communities or tourism-dependent areas. Generic workforce development may not address context-specific needs.\nBorder region dynamics create additional complexity. Texas AHECs serving border communities must navigate bilingual and bicultural dynamics that differ from interior rural areas. Provider cultural competence and language capability matter differently in these contexts.\nThese variations suggest that uniform national AHEC approaches may not optimize for local contexts. States should assess whether their AHEC structures match their specific geographic, cultural, and economic circumstances.\nWhen AHECs Hinder Transformation AHECs impede transformation under different conditions:\nReplication of approaches that have not worked. Fifty years of pipeline programs, rural rotations, and continuing education have not eliminated rural workforce shortages. Proposals to expand these approaches without evidence that expansion achieves different outcomes than previous investment represent optimism unsupported by experience.\nTraining volume metrics without retention outcomes. Measuring students trained without measuring whether training affects practice location provides activity data without outcome evidence. States accepting activity metrics as success indicators enable continued investment without demonstrated impact.\nIncumbent mental models blocking innovation. AHECs develop expertise in their established approaches. When alternative approaches, such as community-based apprenticeship or employer-sponsored training, might perform better, incumbent organizations may resist or dismiss them. Organizational identity constrains strategic flexibility.\nOverhead that does not translate to providers. AHEC programs require administrative infrastructure: coordinators, faculty, facilities, systems. When overhead absorbs resources that could otherwise support direct workforce development, the infrastructure serves itself rather than its purpose.\nAcademic calendar constraints on community needs. Health professions education follows academic structures: semesters, clinical rotation schedules, graduation timelines. Rural communities need providers year-round. AHECs operating within academic constraints may struggle to align training with community timing needs.\nRecommendations For States: Assess AHEC outcomes, not just activities, before finalizing subaward scope. Require evidence that previous investment produced rural practice, not just rural training exposure. Accept proposals promising expanded activity only if accompanied by retention tracking commitments.\nConsider parallel investment in alternative approaches. If incumbent methods have not solved workforce shortages, alternative methods deserve testing. Community-based organizations, employers, and other non-traditional workforce developers may achieve outcomes that AHECs have not.\nRequire retention tracking as a condition of continued funding. If AHECs cannot demonstrate that their programs produce providers practicing in rural communities, continued investment lacks evidentiary justification. Track graduates into practice. Compare outcomes across approaches.\nSpecify targets for workforce categories in critical shortage. Generic pipeline and training investment may not address specific shortage areas. If behavioral health providers represent the most critical gap, require AHEC programming to target behavioral health specifically.\nFor AHECs: Demonstrate willingness to abandon approaches that do not work. Organizational identity built on established methods can constrain innovation. Programs with decades of activity but persistent workforce shortages should consider whether different approaches might perform better.\nAccept outcome accountability willingly. Tracking training volume is easier than tracking retention. But retention matters more. Organizations confident in their value should welcome outcome measurement. Resistance to outcome accountability suggests uncertainty about whether outcomes exist.\nPartner with community-based organizations rather than competing with them. AHECs offer academic connections and coordination infrastructure. Community organizations offer community relationships and cultural competence. Partnership may achieve more than either alone.\nAdvocate for structural changes beyond AHEC capacity. GME funding, compensation reform, scope of practice expansion, and immigration policy affect workforce more than AHEC programs can. AHECs with policy voice should use it to address factors they cannot change directly.\nFor CMS: Fund alternative workforce development approaches to test AHEC assumptions. If community-based hiring, apprenticeship models, or employer-sponsored training outperform traditional academic pathways, that evidence should inform future investment. Comparative evaluation requires funding alternatives.\nRequire retention outcome reporting across all workforce investments. Standardized metrics tracking whether training produces rural practice would enable comparison across approaches and states. Current activity-focused reporting obscures outcome differences.\nSupport innovation alongside incumbent infrastructure. AHEC programs represent established infrastructure that may or may not represent optimal approaches. Funding that flows exclusively through incumbents prevents testing whether alternatives perform better.\nExtend evaluation timelines to capture retention outcomes. Training occurs over months. Practice decisions unfold over years. Retention patterns require decades to assess definitively. Short-term evaluation cannot capture the outcomes that matter most.\nConclusion Area Health Education Centers occupy a complex position in RHTP implementation. They represent substantial infrastructure built over fifty years: academic partnerships, preceptor networks, community presence, and coordination expertise. This infrastructure has value.\nBut rural workforce shortages persist despite five decades of AHEC activity. This persistence demands honest examination of whether established approaches can achieve transformation outcomes or whether alternative approaches deserve investment alongside or instead of incumbent expansion.\nThe tension between incumbent infrastructure and insurgent necessity has no easy resolution. AHEC programs have not solved workforce shortages, but they may have prevented worse outcomes. Alternative approaches lack track record, but established approaches have track records of limited success. Neither expanding proven infrastructure nor risking it for untested innovation represents obviously correct strategy.\nStates should assess AHEC outcomes, not just activities. Training volume matters less than practice location. Retention evidence should drive investment decisions. Where AHECs demonstrate that their programs produce providers practicing in rural communities, continued investment finds justification. Where evidence is absent, continued investment represents faith rather than strategy.\nThe core tension, incumbent versus insurgent, ultimately requires honest outcome assessment. Organizations with fifty years of activity should be able to demonstrate fifty years of impact. If they cannot, the activity may not have produced the impact transformation requires. RHTP implementation should distinguish between infrastructure that delivers value and infrastructure that absorbs resources while delivering less than promised.\nSources Health Resources and Services Administration. “Area Health Education Centers (AHEC).” Bureau of Health Workforce, 2024, bhw.hrsa.gov/programs/area-health-education-centers-ahec.\nHealth Resources and Services Administration. “Designated Health Professional Shortage Areas Statistics.” HRSA Data Warehouse, 2025, data.hrsa.gov/topics/health-workforce/shortage-areas.\nNational AHEC Organization. “AHEC Data Report 2023-2024.” National AHEC Organization, 2024, www.nationalahec.org.\nNC AHEC. “Year in Review 2025.” North Carolina Area Health Education Centers Program, 2025, www.ncahec.net.\nNC AHEC. “Today’s Teachers of Tomorrow’s Healthcare Professionals: Preceptor Report.” North Carolina Area Health Education Centers Program, Feb. 2025.\nNorth Dakota AHEC. “Area Health Education Center Program.” University of North Dakota Center for Rural Health, 2025, ruralhealth.und.edu/projects/ahec.\nNorthern New Hampshire AHEC. “Workforce Development Programs.” North Country Health Consortium, 2025, www.nchcnh.org/AHEC.php.\nOklahoma State University. “Area Health Education Center Program.” OSU Center for Rural Health, 2024, medicine.okstate.edu/rural-health/ahec/.\nSouthern Vermont AHEC. “Professionals: Loan Repayment and Continuing Education.” Southern Vermont Area Health Education Center, 2025, svtahec.org/professionals/.\nWest Central Texas Council of Governments. “Big Country Area Health Education Center.” WCTCOG Community and Economic Development, 2025, www.wctcog.org/ahec/.\nWilliams, Shannen D., et al. “Area Health Education Center (AHEC) Programs for Rural and Underrepresented Minority Students in the Alabama Black Belt.” BMC Research Notes, vol. 10, 2017, article 306.\n",

<p>Area Health Education Centers face a fundamental tension between <strong>incumbent infrastructure and insurgent necessity</strong>. AHECs have built relationships, developed programs, and coordinated clinical training for over fifty years. This infrastructure represents a substantial asset: established connections with academic health centers, networks of clinical training sites, educational programming expertise, and community relationships that take decades to develop.</p>
<p>The insurgent question is uncomfortable but essential: <strong>Rural workforce shortages persist despite fifty years of AHEC activity.</strong> If current approaches had solved the problem, the problem would be solved. It is not. This raises difficult questions about whether RHTP investment should expand proven infrastructure or support alternative approaches that might achieve what incumbents have not.</p>
<p>AHEC programs reach 685,095 participants annually through 300+ centers nationwide (National AHEC Organization). This represents substantial activity. Whether that activity translates to rural workforce adequacy is the question RHTP implementation must address.</p>
<h2 id="the-incumbent-infrastructure">The Incumbent Infrastructure<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-incumbent-infrastructure">#</a></h2>
<p>The AHEC program traces to 1972 federal legislation designed to address geographic maldistribution of healthcare providers. Over five decades, this investment has built substantial infrastructure:</p>
<p><strong>56 AHEC programs operate across states and territories</strong>, typically housed within academic health centers with federal HRSA support supplemented by state and institutional funding. These programs coordinate with medical schools, nursing programs, and allied health training to place students in community-based clinical experiences.</p>
<p><strong>300+ regional AHEC centers extend academic reach into communities.</strong> These centers, distributed across urban and rural areas, maintain relationships with clinical training sites, coordinate student placements, and deliver community health education programming. The distributed structure theoretically enables academic programs to access training sites they could not coordinate independently.</p>
<p><strong>Clinical rotation coordination represents the core function.</strong> Health professions students require supervised clinical experiences before entering practice. Rural areas often lack teaching hospitals and academic faculty. AHECs bridge this gap by identifying community preceptors, coordinating placements, and supporting preceptor development. Without this coordination, rural clinical training sites might not participate in health professions education.</p>
<p><strong>Pipeline programs target future health professionals.</strong> Many AHECs operate programs introducing high school students to health careers, with particular focus on students from rural backgrounds. The theory: students from rural communities more likely choose rural practice. Pipeline programs aim to expand the pool of rural-origin health professions students.</p>
<p><strong>Continuing education supports practicing providers.</strong> Rural practitioners often lack access to professional development available to urban colleagues. AHECs provide continuing education programming that helps rural providers maintain competence and licensure without traveling to urban training centers.</p>
<p>This infrastructure represents genuine assets. Relationships with academic health centers take years to develop. Preceptor networks require cultivation. Community presence builds trust. RHTP implementation should not dismiss these assets casually.</p>
<h2 id="the-insurgent-question">The Insurgent Question<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-insurgent-question">#</a></h2>
<p>The uncomfortable question remains: <strong>Why do rural workforce shortages persist after fifty years of AHEC investment?</strong></p>
<p>Primary care shortages span most rural counties. <strong>85 million Americans live in primary care Health Professional Shortage Areas</strong>, with rural areas disproportionately represented (HRSA). Nursing shortages threaten rural hospital viability. Mental health provider availability in rural areas is approximately one-fifth of urban levels. Dental access remains severely limited.</p>
<p>If AHEC programs effectively address rural workforce maldistribution, these shortages should have diminished over five decades. They have not. This persistence raises several possibilities:</p>
<p><strong>The problem may exceed AHEC capacity.</strong> Workforce distribution reflects factors including compensation differentials, community amenities, professional isolation, spouse employment, and educational opportunities for children. AHECs address training exposure but cannot change the economic and social factors that drive practice location decisions. The problem may simply be larger than the solution.</p>
<p><strong>Current approaches may have reached their effectiveness ceiling.</strong> Pipeline programs, clinical rotations, and continuing education represent established strategies. These strategies may produce incremental benefit without achieving transformation. Doing more of what has not solved the problem may not solve the problem.</p>
<p><strong>Training volume may not equal retention outcomes.</strong> AHECs track students exposed to rural training and providers completing continuing education. They less consistently track whether rural-trained students enter rural practice, whether they remain after loan repayment obligations expire, and whether educational interventions affect long-term career decisions.</p>
<p><strong>Incumbent mental models may constrain innovation.</strong> Organizations develop expertise in their established approaches. AHEC expertise centers on academic partnerships, clinical rotation coordination, and educational programming. Alternative approaches, such as apprenticeship models, community-based hiring, or non-traditional training pathways, may fall outside organizational competence and comfort.</p>

<p><strong>Capacity varies significantly.</strong> North Carolina&rsquo;s mature program with nine regional centers and 2,800+ training sites represents different capability than North Dakota&rsquo;s two-center program serving a smaller population. RHTP subaward scope should reflect actual organizational capacity.</p>
<p><strong>Retention tracking, the outcome that matters most, remains inconsistent.</strong> Some programs systematically follow trainees to assess whether rural exposure translates to rural practice. Others track training volume without connecting to practice location outcomes. Without retention data, training effectiveness remains unknown.</p>
<h2 id="decision-scenario-the-innovation-dilemma">Decision Scenario: The Innovation Dilemma<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#decision-scenario-the-innovation-dilemma">#</a></h2>
<p>A Midwestern state designed its RHTP workforce component with $6.8 million designated for pipeline and training support. The state AHEC submitted a proposal expanding existing programs: enhanced rural rotations, additional pipeline activities, more preceptor development, and expanded continuing education.</p>
<p><strong>A community-based organization proposed an alternative approach.</strong> The organization, rooted in rural communities the state targeted for workforce development, proposed a model based on local hiring and apprenticeship. Rather than recruiting students from elsewhere and exposing them to rural training, the model identified individuals already living in rural communities and supported their progression into healthcare careers through stackable credentials, employer-based training, and community support systems.</p>
<p><strong>The proposals represented fundamentally different theories of change.</strong> The AHEC proposal assumed that exposing health professions students to rural communities during training would influence their eventual practice location choices. The community organization assumed that individuals already rooted in rural communities were more likely to remain if supported through training pathways that did not require them to leave.</p>
<p><strong>The state faced an uncomfortable choice.</strong> The AHEC had established infrastructure, academic partnerships, and decades of experience. The community organization had community relationships but limited track record in workforce development at scale. Choosing the AHEC meant investing in proven infrastructure with unproven outcomes. Choosing the community organization meant risking proven infrastructure for potentially superior but untested innovation.</p>
<p><strong>The state chose a compromise that satisfied neither theory of change.</strong> It awarded $5.2 million to the AHEC for expanded traditional programming and $1.6 million to the community organization for a pilot project. The AHEC interpreted this as validation of its approach. The community organization received insufficient funding to demonstrate its model at meaningful scale.</p>
<p><strong>Year two evaluation revealed expected patterns.</strong> The AHEC reported impressive activity metrics: more rural rotations, more continuing education sessions, more pipeline participants. The community organization struggled with limited resources but showed promising early indicators: participants who completed training remained in their communities because they had never left.</p>
<p><strong>The workforce shortage remained unchanged.</strong> Neither investment at the allocated scale could transform rural workforce availability within RHTP timelines. But the state never learned whether the alternative approach could outperform traditional models because the funding allocation prevented fair comparison.</p>
<h2 id="decision-scenario-the-preceptor-bottleneck">Decision Scenario: The Preceptor Bottleneck<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#decision-scenario-the-preceptor-bottleneck">#</a></h2>
<p>New Hampshire&rsquo;s AHEC identified clinical placement capacity as the binding constraint on rural workforce development. The state&rsquo;s health professions programs could admit more students. Loan repayment programs could incentivize more rural practice. But the limiting factor was preceptors: experienced practitioners willing and able to supervise students in clinical settings.</p>
<p><strong>Rural preceptors face particular challenges.</strong> They typically lack teaching faculty appointments and the protected time those appointments provide. They receive minimal compensation for teaching activities. Adding students to clinical workflows reduces productivity and income. The administrative burden of documentation and evaluation competes with patient care demands.</p>
<p><strong>The AHEC proposed a preceptor support initiative using RHTP funding.</strong> The proposal included stipends for rural preceptors, reduced documentation burden through streamlined evaluation processes, faculty development programming, and recognition systems to acknowledge teaching contributions. The goal: expand rural clinical placement capacity by making precepting more attractive and sustainable.</p>
<p><strong>Implementation revealed deeper issues.</strong> Stipends helped but did not address time constraints. Reduced documentation required academic partner cooperation that proved difficult to achieve. Faculty development required preceptors to take additional time away from practice. Recognition was appreciated but did not change fundamental economic calculations.</p>
<p><strong>The preceptor supply increased modestly but did not transform.</strong> Stipends attracted some new preceptors and retained some who might have stopped. But the fundamental tension between teaching and productivity remained. Preceptors willing to accept reduced income for teaching satisfaction already precepted. Those unwilling to accept that tradeoff found stipends insufficient to change their calculation.</p>
<p><strong>The AHEC succeeded in its defined objectives while failing to solve the underlying problem.</strong> More preceptors participated. More students completed rural rotations. But the bottleneck remained because the intervention addressed symptoms rather than root causes. The economic structure of rural practice made teaching a sacrifice. Modest compensation reduced but did not eliminate that sacrifice.</p>
<h2 id="the-evidence-question">The Evidence Question<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-evidence-question">#</a></h2>
<p>Understanding AHEC effectiveness requires examining available evidence carefully. The evidence base is extensive for activities and limited for outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Substantial evidence documents AHEC activities.</strong> Programs track students completing rural rotations, continuing education participants, pipeline program enrollment, and preceptor engagement. This activity data demonstrates that AHECs do things. Whether those things produce intended outcomes requires different evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Limited evidence connects AHEC exposure to practice location.</strong> Some studies find association between rural training exposure and eventual rural practice. But association does not establish causation. Students who choose rural rotations may already be predisposed to rural practice. The rotation may confirm rather than create their inclination.</p>
<p><strong>Rural origin consistently predicts rural practice more strongly than training exposure.</strong> Students from rural backgrounds choose rural practice at higher rates than urban-origin students exposed to rural training. This finding suggests that <strong>recruitment strategy may matter more than educational intervention.</strong> Expanding the pool of rural-origin health professions students might outperform exposing urban-origin students to rural experiences.</p>
<p><strong>Retention data remains scarce.</strong> Following graduates for years into their careers requires longitudinal tracking that most AHEC programs do not conduct. Without retention data, programs cannot distinguish between short-term placement and long-term practice. A physician who takes a rural position for loan repayment and leaves after three years contributes differently than one who practices rurally for a career. Training programs rarely track these distinctions.</p>
<p><strong>Comparison groups are rarely established.</strong> Evaluating AHEC effectiveness requires comparing outcomes for students with and without AHEC exposure. Without comparison groups, programs cannot determine whether observed outcomes result from intervention or would have occurred regardless.</p>
<p>The evidence question has practical implications for RHTP investment. States should require outcome evidence, not just activity evidence, before committing significant funding to AHEC expansion. Where outcome evidence is unavailable, states should require its collection as a condition of continued funding.</p>
<h2 id="the-ahec-scholars-model">The AHEC Scholars Model<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-ahec-scholars-model">#</a></h2>
<p>The AHEC Scholars Program represents a national initiative designed to enhance rural and underserved workforce development through structured training experiences. Understanding its design illuminates both AHEC strengths and limitations.</p>
<p><strong>The program combines didactic training with clinical experience.</strong> Students complete 40+ hours of community-based training and educational modules covering team-based care, social determinants of health, cultural competency, and practice transformation. This combination addresses critique that clinical rotations alone lack contextual education.</p>
<p><strong>Interdisciplinary training brings students from different professions together.</strong> Physicians, nurses, pharmacists, social workers, and other health professionals train alongside each other, modeling the team-based approaches that rural practice requires. This interprofessional element distinguishes AHEC Scholars from standard clinical rotations.</p>
<p><strong>Stipends support participation.</strong> Students receive up to $1,600 over one to two years, partially offsetting opportunity costs of extended community-based training. Stipends enable participation by students who might otherwise choose more remunerative alternatives.</p>
<p><strong>The program emphasizes underrepresented populations.</strong> Recruitment focuses on minority, disadvantaged, rural-origin, and first-generation college students. This targeting addresses evidence that background predicts practice location.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome tracking remains limited.</strong> The program collects data on participant characteristics and training completion. Tracking whether AHEC Scholars choose rural practice at higher rates than non-participants, and whether they remain longer, requires longitudinal follow-up that is beginning but not yet mature.</p>
<p>The AHEC Scholars model represents AHEC infrastructure at its most sophisticated. Whether that sophistication translates to outcomes that justify investment remains an open question awaiting evidence.</p>
<h2 id="alternative-perspective-the-transformation-impossibility-view">Alternative Perspective: The Transformation Impossibility View<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#alternative-perspective-the-transformation-impossibility-view">#</a></h2>
<p>Some observers argue that <strong>AHECs cannot solve rural workforce shortages because the shortages reflect structural factors beyond educational intervention</strong>. This impossibility view merits examination.</p>
<p><strong>Training capacity is limited by GME slots, not AHEC programs.</strong> Physician supply depends primarily on residency positions funded by Medicare. AHECs can expose students to rural settings but cannot increase the total number of physicians trained. If the pipeline constraint is GME funding, AHEC investment addresses a non-binding constraint.</p>
<p><strong>Rural retention depends on community factors, not educational interventions.</strong> Research consistently shows that rural-origin students more frequently choose rural practice than urban-origin students exposed to rural training. If origin matters more than exposure, pipeline programs targeting existing students may have less impact than recruitment strategies targeting rural communities.</p>
<p><strong>Compensation differentials exceed what education can overcome.</strong> Specialist physicians earn substantially more than primary care physicians. Urban practice often pays more than rural practice. If financial factors drive location decisions, educational interventions cannot compete with economic incentives.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment: This view is partially valid but overstated.</strong> AHECs genuinely cannot solve workforce shortages alone. They cannot increase GME slots, change compensation differentials, or transform community amenities. But they can contribute to solutions as part of broader strategies. Rural rotation experiences do influence some students&rsquo; practice decisions. Pipeline programs do expand the rural-origin student pool. Continuing education does support rural provider retention.</p>
<p>The impossibility view correctly identifies AHEC limitations. It incorrectly concludes that those limitations render AHEC investment valueless. The appropriate conclusion is that AHECs contribute to workforce solutions without providing complete solutions. RHTP should calibrate expectations accordingly.</p>
<h2 id="rhtp-subaward-analysis">RHTP Subaward Analysis<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#rhtp-subaward-analysis">#</a></h2>
<p>AHEC subawards reveal consistent patterns requiring attention:</p>
<p><strong>Program expansion dominates over innovation.</strong> Most AHEC proposals request funding to do more of what they already do: more rotations, more pipeline activities, more continuing education. Proposals for fundamentally different approaches rarely emerge from incumbent organizations whose expertise and identity center on established methods.</p>
<p><strong>Pipeline metrics emphasize exposure over outcome.</strong> Subawards measure students completing rural rotations, high schoolers participating in health career programs, and providers attending continuing education. They rarely require tracking whether rotations predict rural practice, whether pipeline participants enter health professions, or whether continuing education affects retention.</p>
<p><strong>Academic partnerships shape priorities.</strong> AHECs exist within academic health center structures. Their priorities reflect academic calendars, credentialing requirements, and institutional relationships. Community needs may receive attention, but academic structures constrain flexibility.</p>
<p><strong>Pass-through to communities varies significantly.</strong> Some AHECs function as coordinating entities directing resources to community-based training sites and preceptors. Others retain most funding for programmatic infrastructure with limited community pass-through. The appropriate balance depends on specific state contexts.</p>
<p><strong>Retention accountability remains rare.</strong> RHTP success requires providers practicing in rural communities, not students completing rural training. AHECs track the latter because they control it. They rarely track the former because it requires following graduates for years after program completion into practice decisions AHEC cannot influence.</p>
<h2 id="when-ahecs-help-transformation">When AHECs Help Transformation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#when-ahecs-help-transformation">#</a></h2>
<p>AHECs contribute genuine value under specific conditions:</p>
<p><strong>States with strong academic health center partnerships.</strong> Where medical schools, nursing programs, and allied health training actively partner with AHEC networks, the coordination infrastructure adds clear value. Students need clinical placements. Rural communities need students. AHECs bridge this gap.</p>
<p><strong>Integration with other workforce strategies.</strong> AHECs alone cannot solve workforce shortages. AHECs coordinated with loan repayment, immigration visa programs, telehealth expansion, and scope of practice reform contribute to comprehensive approaches. The coordination role leverages AHEC relationships and expertise.</p>
<p><strong>Focus on retention, not just training.</strong> Programs tracking whether rural-trained students enter and remain in rural practice can demonstrate impact. Programs measuring only training exposure cannot. AHECs willing to accept retention accountability provide more credible evidence of value.</p>
<p><strong>Adaptation to rural community needs.</strong> Traditional health professions education follows established pathways: degree programs, clinical rotations, licensure examinations. Some rural communities need workforce development that follows different pathways: stackable credentials, employer-based training, community health worker certification. AHECs willing to support non-traditional approaches expand their value beyond academic coordination.</p>
<p><strong>Preceptor network maintenance in underserved areas.</strong> Clinical training requires supervised experience. In areas with few practitioners, each preceptor matters. AHECs that cultivate and support preceptor networks maintain infrastructure that individual training programs cannot sustain independently.</p>
<h2 id="the-community-health-worker-question">The Community Health Worker Question<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-community-health-worker-question">#</a></h2>
<p>One area where AHEC incumbent status may most constrain innovation involves community health workers and other non-traditional workforce categories. CHWs represent a growing workforce development strategy that does not fit traditional AHEC models.</p>
<p><strong>Community health workers typically emerge from communities they serve.</strong> Unlike physicians and nurses trained through academic pathways, CHWs often enter healthcare through community organizations, receive training through non-academic programs, and hold certifications rather than professional licenses.</p>
<p><strong>AHEC expertise centers on academic health professions.</strong> Programs coordinate with medical schools, nursing programs, and allied health training. They have less experience with community-based workforce development that does not require academic credentials.</p>
<p><strong>Some AHECs have expanded to include CHW programming.</strong> These programs recognize that rural workforce needs extend beyond traditional providers. But expansion into new workforce categories requires organizational adaptation that incumbent structures may resist.</p>
<p><strong>Alternative organizations may have comparative advantage for CHW development.</strong> Community-based organizations with deep community relationships, cultural competence, and experience with non-academic training may produce CHW outcomes that AHECs cannot match.</p>
<p>The question is not whether AHECs can participate in CHW development. Many can. The question is whether AHEC participation adds value or whether resources directed to CHW development through AHECs would produce better outcomes if directed through community-based alternatives. RHTP implementation should test this question rather than assume that AHEC participation in all workforce categories adds value.</p>
<h2 id="geographic-and-cultural-considerations">Geographic and Cultural Considerations<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#geographic-and-cultural-considerations">#</a></h2>
<p>AHEC effectiveness likely varies by geography and culture in ways that aggregate program data obscure.</p>
<p><strong>States with concentrated rural populations may differ from those with dispersed rural populations.</strong> North Carolina&rsquo;s AHEC with nine regional centers can maintain presence across the state&rsquo;s rural areas. Montana&rsquo;s or Alaska&rsquo;s vast distances create different challenges that centralized AHEC models may not address effectively.</p>
<p><strong>Cultural competence requirements vary regionally.</strong> AHECs serving tribal communities need different capabilities than those serving Appalachian populations or Delta communities. Academic health center partnerships may not provide the cultural competence that specific communities require.</p>
<p><strong>Economic contexts differ.</strong> Rural communities with resource extraction economies face different workforce challenges than agricultural communities or tourism-dependent areas. Generic workforce development may not address context-specific needs.</p>
<p><strong>Border region dynamics create additional complexity.</strong> Texas AHECs serving border communities must navigate bilingual and bicultural dynamics that differ from interior rural areas. Provider cultural competence and language capability matter differently in these contexts.</p>
<p>These variations suggest that <strong>uniform national AHEC approaches may not optimize for local contexts.</strong> States should assess whether their AHEC structures match their specific geographic, cultural, and economic circumstances.</p>
<h2 id="when-ahecs-hinder-transformation">When AHECs Hinder Transformation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#when-ahecs-hinder-transformation">#</a></h2>
<p>AHECs impede transformation under different conditions:</p>
<p><strong>Replication of approaches that have not worked.</strong> Fifty years of pipeline programs, rural rotations, and continuing education have not eliminated rural workforce shortages. Proposals to expand these approaches without evidence that expansion achieves different outcomes than previous investment represent optimism unsupported by experience.</p>
<p><strong>Training volume metrics without retention outcomes.</strong> Measuring students trained without measuring whether training affects practice location provides activity data without outcome evidence. States accepting activity metrics as success indicators enable continued investment without demonstrated impact.</p>
<p><strong>Incumbent mental models blocking innovation.</strong> AHECs develop expertise in their established approaches. When alternative approaches, such as community-based apprenticeship or employer-sponsored training, might perform better, incumbent organizations may resist or dismiss them. Organizational identity constrains strategic flexibility.</p>
<p><strong>Overhead that does not translate to providers.</strong> AHEC programs require administrative infrastructure: coordinators, faculty, facilities, systems. When overhead absorbs resources that could otherwise support direct workforce development, the infrastructure serves itself rather than its purpose.</p>
<p><strong>Academic calendar constraints on community needs.</strong> Health professions education follows academic structures: semesters, clinical rotation schedules, graduation timelines. Rural communities need providers year-round. AHECs operating within academic constraints may struggle to align training with community timing needs.</p>
<h2 id="recommendations">Recommendations<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#recommendations">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>For States:</strong>
Assess AHEC outcomes, not just activities, before finalizing subaward scope. Require evidence that previous investment produced rural practice, not just rural training exposure. Accept proposals promising expanded activity only if accompanied by retention tracking commitments.</p>
<p>Consider parallel investment in alternative approaches. If incumbent methods have not solved workforce shortages, alternative methods deserve testing. Community-based organizations, employers, and other non-traditional workforce developers may achieve outcomes that AHECs have not.</p>
<p>Require retention tracking as a condition of continued funding. If AHECs cannot demonstrate that their programs produce providers practicing in rural communities, continued investment lacks evidentiary justification. Track graduates into practice. Compare outcomes across approaches.</p>
<p>Specify targets for workforce categories in critical shortage. Generic pipeline and training investment may not address specific shortage areas. If behavioral health providers represent the most critical gap, require AHEC programming to target behavioral health specifically.</p>
<p><strong>For AHECs:</strong>
Demonstrate willingness to abandon approaches that do not work. Organizational identity built on established methods can constrain innovation. Programs with decades of activity but persistent workforce shortages should consider whether different approaches might perform better.</p>
<p>Accept outcome accountability willingly. Tracking training volume is easier than tracking retention. But retention matters more. Organizations confident in their value should welcome outcome measurement. Resistance to outcome accountability suggests uncertainty about whether outcomes exist.</p>
<p>Partner with community-based organizations rather than competing with them. AHECs offer academic connections and coordination infrastructure. Community organizations offer community relationships and cultural competence. Partnership may achieve more than either alone.</p>
<p>Advocate for structural changes beyond AHEC capacity. GME funding, compensation reform, scope of practice expansion, and immigration policy affect workforce more than AHEC programs can. AHECs with policy voice should use it to address factors they cannot change directly.</p>
<p><strong>For CMS:</strong>
Fund alternative workforce development approaches to test AHEC assumptions. If community-based hiring, apprenticeship models, or employer-sponsored training outperform traditional academic pathways, that evidence should inform future investment. Comparative evaluation requires funding alternatives.</p>
<p>Require retention outcome reporting across all workforce investments. Standardized metrics tracking whether training produces rural practice would enable comparison across approaches and states. Current activity-focused reporting obscures outcome differences.</p>
<p>Support innovation alongside incumbent infrastructure. AHEC programs represent established infrastructure that may or may not represent optimal approaches. Funding that flows exclusively through incumbents prevents testing whether alternatives perform better.</p>
<p>Extend evaluation timelines to capture retention outcomes. Training occurs over months. Practice decisions unfold over years. Retention patterns require decades to assess definitively. Short-term evaluation cannot capture the outcomes that matter most.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>Area Health Education Centers occupy a complex position in RHTP implementation. They represent substantial infrastructure built over fifty years: academic partnerships, preceptor networks, community presence, and coordination expertise. This infrastructure has value.</p>
<p>But rural workforce shortages persist despite five decades of AHEC activity. This persistence demands honest examination of whether established approaches can achieve transformation outcomes or whether alternative approaches deserve investment alongside or instead of incumbent expansion.</p>
<p><strong>The tension between incumbent infrastructure and insurgent necessity has no easy resolution.</strong> AHEC programs have not solved workforce shortages, but they may have prevented worse outcomes. Alternative approaches lack track record, but established approaches have track records of limited success. Neither expanding proven infrastructure nor risking it for untested innovation represents obviously correct strategy.</p>
<p>States should assess AHEC outcomes, not just activities. Training volume matters less than practice location. Retention evidence should drive investment decisions. Where AHECs demonstrate that their programs produce providers practicing in rural communities, continued investment finds justification. Where evidence is absent, continued investment represents faith rather than strategy.</p>
<p><strong>The core tension, incumbent versus insurgent, ultimately requires honest outcome assessment.</strong> Organizations with fifty years of activity should be able to demonstrate fifty years of impact. If they cannot, the activity may not have produced the impact transformation requires. RHTP implementation should distinguish between infrastructure that delivers value and infrastructure that absorbs resources while delivering less than promised.</p>
