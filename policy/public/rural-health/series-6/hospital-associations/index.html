  "articleBody": "Hospital associations occupy a privileged position in RHTP implementation. State agencies across the country channel transformation funding through these organizations, trusting them to deliver technical assistance, coordinate regional networks, and support hospitals through difficult transitions. The Texas Organization of Rural and Community Hospitals receives state contracts for rural hospital financial analysis. The Kentucky Hospital Association manages workforce development subawards. The Georgia Hospital Association coordinates quality improvement initiatives.\nThe assumption underlying these arrangements is straightforward: hospital associations know their members, have their trust, and can help them change. The question this article examines is whether organizations whose fundamental purpose is member advocacy can genuinely serve transformation goals that may threaten member survival.\nRHTP transformation requires honest assessment of which hospitals should continue operating, which should convert to different models, and which should close. Regional network development may reduce individual hospital autonomy. Payment model innovation shifts risk to providers. Workforce strategies may concentrate specialists at hub facilities rather than distributing them across member institutions. Each transformation approach potentially threatens some association members.\nHospital associations face a structural dilemma: their boards consist of member hospital executives, their revenues depend on member dues and services, and their organizational identity centers on representing hospital interests. When transformation and member protection conflict, which master do they serve?\nThe Member Service Imperative Hospital associations exist because hospitals need collective representation. Individual rural hospitals lack the resources for sustained policy advocacy, sophisticated data analysis, or comprehensive technical assistance. Associations aggregate these functions, providing services that individual members could not afford independently.\nThe governance structure reinforces member primacy. Association boards typically comprise hospital CEOs and administrators who expect the organization to represent their interests. Board members facing financial distress want advocacy for enhanced reimbursement, not analysis suggesting their facilities should close. Board members investing in service expansion want support, not questions about regional need.\nRevenue structures deepen member dependence. Membership dues constitute the core funding base, supplemented by conference fees, group purchasing arrangements, and consulting services. These revenue streams all depend on hospital satisfaction. Associations that displease members risk dues nonpayment, conference boycotts, and service cancellations.\nThe advocacy function represents associations’ most visible activity. State hospital associations maintain lobbyists, develop legislative priorities, testify before committees, and mobilize members for political action. The Texas Organization of Rural and Community Hospitals publishes detailed legislative priorities including enhanced Medicaid reimbursement, rural hospital grant funding, and support for Rural Emergency Hospital conversions. The Kentucky Hospital Association advocates for state investments in rural hospital viability. The Georgia Hospital Association coordinates the Georgia HEART rural hospital tax credit program that has channeled over $400 million to rural hospitals since 2017.\nThis advocacy work creates relationships and credibility that associations bring to RHTP implementation. Legislators trust association data. State agencies rely on association expertise. Hospitals view associations as their champions. These relationships represent genuine assets.\nThe question is whether advocacy relationships can coexist with transformation honesty. When association analysis reveals that a member hospital should close, does the relationship enable difficult conversations or prevent them?\nThe Transformation Challenge RHTP invests $50 billion to transform rural health, not merely sustain existing arrangements. The program’s logic assumes that current rural health infrastructure is inadequate and requires fundamental change. Some hospitals that exist today should not exist in their current form after transformation.\nRural Emergency Hospital conversions represent the clearest example. Congress created the REH designation recognizing that some Critical Access Hospitals cannot sustain full inpatient services but should maintain emergency and outpatient capabilities. As of January 2026, 42 hospitals have converted to REH status nationwide. Many more are evaluating conversion.\nHospital associations have responded ambivalently to REH development. They advocate for improved REH reimbursement and regulatory clarity, legitimate policy work that serves hospitals considering conversion. But associations rarely proactively counsel members toward conversion. The decision to recommend that a member close its inpatient unit conflicts with the advocacy identity that sees hospital closure as failure.\nRegional network development presents similar tensions. RHTP encourages hub and spoke arrangements where larger facilities provide specialty services while smaller facilities handle primary and emergency care. These arrangements can strengthen regional systems but reduce individual hospital autonomy. A spoke hospital that transfers complex cases to a hub may eventually question why it maintains capabilities it rarely uses.\nHospital associations have advocated for flexible network arrangements that preserve member autonomy. They resist models requiring facilities to cede services to hub institutions. The preference for voluntary coordination over directed integration reflects member interests in maintaining independence, even when directed integration might produce better community outcomes.\nWorkforce strategies create direct conflicts. RHTP supports growing the rural health workforce, but workforce strategies that concentrate specialists at hub facilities rather than distributing them across all hospitals threaten smaller facilities. If regional cardiologists practice at the hub, smaller hospitals lose the recruitment battles they were already losing. Associations generally advocate for workforce approaches that benefit all members, which may mean less effective approaches overall.\nState Hospital Association Landscape Hospital associations vary enormously in size, sophistication, and rural focus. Some associations maintain substantial rural programs with dedicated staff and significant resources. Others treat rural hospitals as a constituency among many, with limited specialized capacity.\nAssociation State Rural Members Total Budget Rural Staff RHTP Role Est. Subaward Rural Focus TORCH TX 164 $4.8M 18 TA, data, advocacy $14M Primary Kentucky Hospital Assn KY 52 $12.3M 4 Workforce, TA $8M Secondary Georgia Hospital Assn GA 48 $18.7M 6 Quality, HEART coord $11M Secondary Ohio Hospital Assn OH 41 $22.4M 3 Policy, data $6M Tertiary Mississippi Hospital Assn MS 68 $3.2M 7 TA, conversion support $9M Primary North Carolina Hospital Assn NC 37 $15.8M 5 Quality, workforce $7M Secondary California Hospital Assn CA 89 $45.2M 4 Policy, data $5M Tertiary Montana Hospital Assn MT 48 $2.1M 8 TA, network coord $6M Primary Rural focus categories reflect the proportion of association resources and attention dedicated to rural hospitals specifically. Primary focus associations have rural health as their core mission (TORCH serves only rural and community hospitals). Secondary focus associations maintain substantial rural programs within broader hospital representation. Tertiary focus associations address rural issues as one constituency among many.\nThe budget and staffing data reveal capacity constraints. Even well-resourced associations have limited rural-specific staff. TORCH’s 18 dedicated staff represent exceptional rural focus; most associations assign fewer than 10 people to rural issues. These capacity limitations constrain the technical assistance associations can actually deliver.\nRHTP subaward amounts reflect state decisions about association roles. Texas channels substantial funding through TORCH for data analysis and technical assistance. Mississippi relies heavily on association infrastructure given limited state agency rural health capacity. California and Ohio provide smaller association roles, preferring direct state implementation or alternative intermediaries.\nCase Study: The Conversion Counseling Dilemma Riverside Community Hospital (name changed) had served its West Texas community for 67 years when CEO Maria Gonzalez requested TORCH assistance in late 2024. The 25 bed Critical Access Hospital was losing $180,000 monthly. Three years of operating losses had depleted reserves. The medical staff had declined from 12 active physicians to 4, with the remaining doctors averaging 63 years old. The hospital maintained obstetric services that averaged 3 deliveries per month, each requiring on call coverage that exhausted the medical staff.\nTORCH’s financial analysis team conducted comprehensive assessment. The findings were unambiguous: Riverside could not sustain current operations. Inpatient utilization had declined 40% over five years as the county population aged and younger residents relocated. The payer mix had shifted toward Medicare, which reimbursed below cost. Even aggressive cost cutting could not bridge the structural deficit.\nThe analysis identified three options. Option one: continue current operations while seeking increased community support, accepting ongoing losses and eventual closure when reserves exhausted. Option two: convert to Rural Emergency Hospital status, maintaining emergency and outpatient services while eliminating inpatient care, reducing losses to approximately $40,000 monthly with enhanced REH reimbursement. Option three: close entirely and work with regional partners to establish alternative access points.\nThe TORCH team faced the transformation dilemma directly. Their analysis clearly supported REH conversion as the most sustainable path. But recommending that a member hospital close its inpatient unit, eliminate obstetric services, and fundamentally change its community role conflicted with decades of association identity built on fighting hospital closures.\nThe team presented all three options to Gonzalez and the board, with detailed financial projections for each. They provided technical assistance on REH conversion requirements and connected Riverside with other hospitals that had converted. They facilitated conversations with the regional hub hospital about transfer protocols and specialist coverage.\nWhat TORCH did not do was clearly recommend conversion. The presentation framed conversion as one option among others, despite analysis showing it as the only sustainable path. Board members who wanted to preserve the hospital’s traditional role found no clear guidance pushing toward difficult decisions.\nRiverside’s board ultimately voted to continue operations while pursuing community fundraising. Six months later, facing deepening losses and failed fundraising, the board revisited conversion. By then, two physicians had retired, emergency department volumes had declined further, and the conversion financial projections had worsened.\nThe delay cost the community. Had TORCH clearly recommended conversion when the analysis supported it, Riverside might have transitioned with stronger financial position and better physician coverage. The association’s reluctance to advocate for transformation it had analytically identified cost the community options.\nTORCH staff members, interviewed confidentially, acknowledged the tension. “Our job is to help hospitals, and sometimes helping means telling them hard truths,” one senior staff member noted. “But we’re also accountable to a board of hospital CEOs who don’t want to hear that their peers should close services. There’s pressure, spoken and unspoken, to present options rather than recommendations.”\nAlternative Perspective: The Necessary Infrastructure Defense Critics of hospital association RHTP roles must contend with a practical reality: state agencies lack the relationships and credibility to implement transformation without intermediary support. Rural hospital administrators trust their associations in ways they do not trust state bureaucracies. This trust enables conversations that would not otherwise occur.\nThe strongest version of this argument holds that transformation requires hospitals to take difficult actions voluntarily. Regulators cannot force hospitals to convert, consolidate, or close except through indirect pressure. Voluntary action requires trusted advisors who can help hospital leaders see options, understand implications, and navigate change. Hospital associations have decades of relationship investment that state agencies cannot replicate.\nThe argument has merit. TORCH’s relationship with Texas rural hospitals, built over 35 years, enables access that state agencies lack. Hospital CEOs share financial data with TORCH that they would not share with regulators. They attend TORCH conferences, participate in TORCH learning collaboratives, and call TORCH staff for advice. These relationships represent genuine infrastructure for transformation communication.\nThe counterargument is equally practical: relationships constrained by member advocacy may not serve transformation. A trusted advisor who cannot give honest advice is not actually helpful. If TORCH cannot recommend conversion when analysis supports it, the relationship value diminishes. Trust that depends on telling members what they want to hear is not the kind of trust transformation requires.\nEvidence from RHTP implementation suggests both dynamics operate. Hospital associations have successfully facilitated transformation conversations that would not have occurred through state agencies alone. They have also softened transformation messages, delayed difficult recommendations, and prioritized member comfort over community need. Neither the romanticized view nor the cynical view captures the full picture.\nRHTP Subaward Analysis State approaches to hospital association RHTP subawards reveal different assumptions about the member advocacy tension.\nState Subawardee Award Amount Functions Pass-Through % Outcome Accountability Texas TORCH $14.2M Financial analysis, TA, data 35% Activity metrics Georgia GHA $11.4M Quality improvement, HEART 28% Quality measures Kentucky KHA $8.1M Workforce pipeline, TA 42% Training completion Mississippi MHA $9.3M Conversion support, TA 31% Conversions facilitated North Carolina NCHA $7.2M Quality, workforce 38% Composite metrics Montana MHA $6.4M Network coordination, TA 25% Network participation Pass-through percentages indicate how much subaward funding reaches hospitals versus being retained by associations for administrative costs and staff. Higher pass-through suggests more direct hospital support; lower pass-through indicates more association-delivered services. Neither is inherently superior, but the variation reveals different implementation models.\nOutcome accountability structures range from weak to moderate. No state examined requires associations to demonstrate transformation outcomes as opposed to transformation activities. Texas tracks technical assistance sessions delivered and hospital satisfaction, not whether assisted hospitals actually transformed. Mississippi counts conversion support activities, not whether supported hospitals made sustainable decisions.\nThis accountability gap reflects the member service tension. State agencies that require associations to demonstrate transformation outcomes create pressure for associations to push members toward change. Associations resist outcome accountability precisely because it would require advocacy-limiting honesty. States that want association cooperation avoid accountability structures that associations resist.\nThe resulting arrangements produce activity without guaranteed transformation. Associations deliver technical assistance sessions, quality improvement programs, and workforce development initiatives. Whether these activities produce actual transformation remains unmeasured.\nCase Study: Network Development and Member Autonomy The Upper Peninsula Health Network in Michigan illustrates how hospital association advocacy can shape RHTP implementation in ways that protect members while potentially undermining transformation.\nMichigan’s RHTP application proposed regional networks with clear hub and spoke designations. The application identified larger hospitals as hubs responsible for specialty services, complex care, and workforce concentration. Smaller hospitals would serve as spokes providing primary care, emergency stabilization, and transfer coordination. The network structure required spokes to forgo certain service development in favor of regional efficiency.\nThe Michigan Hospital Association raised concerns during application development. Several member hospitals designated as spokes objected to restrictions on their service development. They wanted to maintain options for future service expansion even if current utilization did not support those services. The association advocated for softer network structures that encouraged rather than required coordination.\nThe final application reflected association influence. Hub and spoke designations became “network partnership levels” without clear service restrictions. Hospitals could participate at varying levels based on self-selected roles. The transformation from mandatory to voluntary network structure preserved member autonomy at the cost of network clarity.\nImplementation revealed the consequences. Two years into the network, supposed spoke hospitals had independently recruited cardiologists who competed with hub services. A spoke hospital that was expected to transfer complex cases instead invested in intensive care capabilities that duplicated hub capacity. Network coordination meetings became contentious as hospitals defended independent decisions that undermined regional planning.\nThe Michigan Hospital Association celebrated the network’s flexibility. Member hospitals appreciated maintaining autonomy. State agency staff privately acknowledged that the network had not achieved the coordination RHTP envisioned. Resources had been distributed across facilities without creating the regional efficiencies that concentrated investment might have achieved.\nAssociation staff defended their advocacy. “We represent hospitals, and hospitals wanted flexibility,” one staff member explained. “Forcing consolidation that members oppose would have undermined the entire network. Better to have voluntary coordination than mandated structures that hospitals resent and resist.”\nThe alternative view holds that voluntary coordination produces voluntary non-coordination. Networks require discipline that voluntary arrangements cannot sustain. The association’s successful advocacy for member autonomy may have prevented the transformation Michigan communities needed.\nWhen Hospital Associations Help Transformation Despite the structural tensions, hospital associations contribute genuine transformation value under specific conditions.\nPeer learning facilitation represents associations’ clearest value-add. When hospitals see peers successfully navigating transformation, they become more willing to consider change. Associations convene peer learning opportunities that state agencies cannot replicate. TORCH’s REH peer network connects converted hospitals with facilities considering conversion, providing practical guidance and emotional support that reduces conversion anxiety.\nTechnical assistance on discrete tasks draws on association expertise without requiring advocacy-challenging recommendations. Associations help hospitals understand REH conversion requirements, navigate regulatory processes, and implement operational changes. This technical support adds value when the transformation direction is already determined; associations help with how, not whether.\nData aggregation and benchmarking provide hospitals information for self-assessment. TORCH’s hospital dashboard allows rural Texas hospitals to compare performance against peers, identifying improvement opportunities without association staff making explicit recommendations. The data may prompt transformation conclusions that association advocacy could not directly state.\nPolicy advocacy for transformation-enabling policies aligns member interests with transformation goals. Associations advocating for enhanced REH reimbursement, flexible network regulations, and workforce support create conditions for transformation without requiring associations to push members toward change.\nWhen Hospital Associations Hinder Transformation The same structural features that enable association value-add can obstruct transformation.\nProtection of members that should close or convert reflects the core tension. When association analysis identifies hospitals that cannot sustain current operations, advocacy identity prevents clear recommendations. The TORCH vignette illustrates how this protection delays difficult decisions that communities must eventually face anyway.\nAdvocacy against regional consolidation reflects member preference for autonomy over efficiency. The Michigan vignette shows how association advocacy can reshape transformation proposals to protect member independence at the cost of regional coordination.\nTechnical assistance focused on member survival rather than community need substitutes hospital-centered for community-centered analysis. Associations asking “how can this hospital survive?” rather than “what does this community need?” may perpetuate facilities that no longer serve community interests.\nCapture of transformation funding for member services redirects RHTP investment from transformation to sustainability. When associations interpret transformation broadly enough to include any hospital support, funding flows toward existing arrangements rather than change.\nAssessment and Recommendations Hospital associations are neither uniformly helpful nor uniformly harmful to RHTP transformation. Their value depends on how subaward structures align advocacy incentives with transformation goals.\nEvidence from RHTP implementation suggests:\nThe member service imperative genuinely constrains transformation honesty. Associations rarely proactively recommend facility closure or service elimination, even when analysis supports those conclusions. The structural tension is real, not imagined.\nAssociation relationships enable transformation conversations that would not otherwise occur. Rural hospitals trust associations in ways they do not trust state agencies. This trust has genuine value that states cannot easily replicate.\nCurrent subaward structures do not resolve the tension. Activity-focused accountability allows associations to deliver services without demonstrating transformation outcomes. States get association cooperation at the cost of transformation accountability.\nFor State Agencies\nStructure subawards around transformation outcomes, not activity metrics. If associations receive funding for REH conversion support, measure conversions achieved, not consultations provided. Accept that outcome accountability will create association resistance and require negotiation.\nMaintain direct state-to-hospital relationships alongside association channels. Do not become entirely dependent on association intermediation. Direct relationships provide alternative information sources and preserve state options if association performance disappoints.\nRequire associations to provide clear recommendations, not just options, when analysis supports specific conclusions. Fund analytical work only if associations commit to delivering honest findings even when findings challenge member interests.\nFor Hospital Associations\nAcknowledge the member service and transformation tension explicitly. Associations that pretend the tension does not exist cannot manage it constructively. Honest acknowledgment enables governance conversations about how to balance competing obligations.\nDevelop transformation credibility through demonstrated willingness to deliver difficult messages. Associations that have successfully counseled members through closures and conversions have demonstrated that advocacy and honesty can coexist. Use these examples to build organizational capacity for transformation support.\nAccept outcome accountability as the price of transformation funding. If associations want RHTP resources, they must accept measurement of transformation results. Resisting accountability undermines association claims of transformation value.\nFor CMS\nMonitor association overhead and outcomes across states. Require states to report subaward structures, pass-through percentages, and transformation outcomes by intermediary type. Publish comparison data enabling state learning from peer approaches.\nRequire outcome evidence, not just participation documentation. Activity metrics allow associations to demonstrate effort without results. Transformation metrics require associations to demonstrate that their involvement produces community benefit.\nSupport direct-to-provider channels as alternatives to association intermediation. Technology enables state and federal agencies to reach providers directly. Maintaining these channels preserves options when association performance proves inadequate.\nConclusion Hospital associations bring genuine assets to RHTP implementation: member relationships, institutional knowledge, convening capacity, and technical expertise. These assets have real value that states cannot easily replicate.\nBut associations also bring structural constraints: governance by member executives, revenue dependence on member satisfaction, and organizational identity built on member advocacy. These constraints limit association ability to serve transformation goals that threaten member interests.\nThe evidence suggests that associations can help transformation under specific conditions: clearly structured outcome accountability, explicit acknowledgment of the advocacy tension, and state willingness to maintain alternative channels. Absent these conditions, associations tend toward member protection that may obstruct the transformation communities need.\nThe romanticized view that associations are essential infrastructure overlooks the advocacy constraints that limit transformation support. The cynical view that associations are merely captured rent-seekers ignores the genuine relationship value that enables transformation conversations.\nThe honest view is more complex: hospital associations are potentially valuable transformation partners whose contribution depends on accountability structures that most states have not yet implemented. The question is not whether to involve associations, but whether states will structure involvement in ways that align advocacy incentives with transformation goals.\nCross-References Series 5 (State Agencies): 5A examines lead agency decisions about intermediary roles; 5C covers procurement approaches including association subawards Series 7 (Healthcare Providers): 7A assesses CAH perspectives on association value; provider views test whether state-perceived value translates to community-experienced value Series 3 (State Profiles): Texas, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, and Michigan profiles detail state-specific association arrangements Series 4 (Transformation Approaches): 4E examines hub and spoke networks where association advocacy shapes implementation Sources American Hospital Association. “AHA 2024 IRS Form 990.” AHA, Nov. 2024, aha.org/legal-documents/2024-11-06-american-hospital-association-2023-irs-form-990.\nBipartisan Policy Center. “The Rural Emergency Hospital Model: Year Two Progress Report.” BPC, Oct. 2024, bipartisanpolicy.org/report/rural-emergency-hospital-year-two.\nGeorgia Department of Community Health. “Rural Hospital Tax Credit Program.” DCH, 2025, dch.georgia.gov/programs/rural-hospital-tax-credit.\nGeorgia HEART. “Frequently Asked Questions.” Georgia HEART, 2025, georgiaheart.org/about/page/frequently-asked-questions.\nHealth Resources and Services Administration. “Rural Health Grants: State Fact Sheets.” HRSA, 2024, hrsa.gov/rural-health/about-us/state-fact-sheets.\nNational Rural Health Association. “About NRHA.” NRHA, 2025, ruralhealth.us/about-nrha.\nNational Rural Health Association. “Rural Health Policy Institute.” NRHA, 2026, ruralhealth.us/events/schedule/rural-health-policy-institute.\nTexas Health and Human Services Commission. “Rural Hospital Finance.” HHSC, 2024, hhs.texas.gov/providers/medicaid-business-resources/medicaid-supplemental-payment-directed-payment-programs/rural-hospital-finance.\nTexas Organization of Rural and Community Hospitals. “Legislative Priorities.” TORCH, 2025, torchnet.org/advocacy–legislative-priorities.html.\nTexas Organization of Rural and Community Hospitals. “Hospital Dashboard.” TORCH, 2025, torchnet.org/hospitaldashboard.html.\nThe Optimist. “Texas Rural Hospitals Await the Budget Cut Storm.” Abilene Christian University, 31 Oct. 2025, acuoptimist.com/2025/10/texas-rural-hospitals-await-the-budget-cut-storm.\nWikipedia. “National Rural Health Association.” Wikipedia, 5 Apr. 2025, en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Rural_Health_Association.\nRHTP Series 6: Intermediary Organizations Rural Health Transformation Project Article 6.A Version 2 January 2026\n",

  </a>
</div>

<p>Hospital associations occupy a <strong>privileged position in RHTP implementation</strong>. State agencies across the country channel transformation funding through these organizations, trusting them to deliver technical assistance, coordinate regional networks, and support hospitals through difficult transitions. The Texas Organization of Rural and Community Hospitals receives state contracts for rural hospital financial analysis. The Kentucky Hospital Association manages workforce development subawards. The Georgia Hospital Association coordinates quality improvement initiatives.</p>
<p>The assumption underlying these arrangements is straightforward: hospital associations know their members, have their trust, and can help them change. <strong>The question this article examines is whether organizations whose fundamental purpose is member advocacy can genuinely serve transformation goals that may threaten member survival.</strong></p>
<p>RHTP transformation requires honest assessment of which hospitals should continue operating, which should convert to different models, and which should close. Regional network development may reduce individual hospital autonomy. Payment model innovation shifts risk to providers. Workforce strategies may concentrate specialists at hub facilities rather than distributing them across member institutions. Each transformation approach potentially threatens some association members.</p>
<p>Hospital associations face a structural dilemma: their boards consist of member hospital executives, their revenues depend on member dues and services, and their organizational identity centers on representing hospital interests. When transformation and member protection conflict, <strong>which master do they serve?</strong></p>
<h2 id="the-member-service-imperative">The Member Service Imperative<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-member-service-imperative">#</a></h2>
<p>Hospital associations exist because hospitals need collective representation. <strong>Individual rural hospitals lack the resources for sustained policy advocacy</strong>, sophisticated data analysis, or comprehensive technical assistance. Associations aggregate these functions, providing services that individual members could not afford independently.</p>
<p>The governance structure reinforces member primacy. Association boards typically comprise hospital CEOs and administrators who expect the organization to represent their interests. Board members facing financial distress want advocacy for enhanced reimbursement, not analysis suggesting their facilities should close. Board members investing in service expansion want support, not questions about regional need.</p>
<p>Revenue structures deepen member dependence. <strong>Membership dues constitute the core funding base</strong>, supplemented by conference fees, group purchasing arrangements, and consulting services. These revenue streams all depend on hospital satisfaction. Associations that displease members risk dues nonpayment, conference boycotts, and service cancellations.</p>
<p>The advocacy function represents associations&rsquo; most visible activity. State hospital associations maintain lobbyists, develop legislative priorities, testify before committees, and mobilize members for political action. The Texas Organization of Rural and Community Hospitals publishes detailed legislative priorities including <strong>enhanced Medicaid reimbursement</strong>, rural hospital grant funding, and support for Rural Emergency Hospital conversions. The Kentucky Hospital Association advocates for state investments in rural hospital viability. The Georgia Hospital Association coordinates the Georgia HEART rural hospital tax credit program that has channeled over $400 million to rural hospitals since 2017.</p>
<p>This advocacy work creates relationships and credibility that associations bring to RHTP implementation. <strong>Legislators trust association data</strong>. State agencies rely on association expertise. Hospitals view associations as their champions. These relationships represent genuine assets.</p>
<p>The question is whether advocacy relationships can coexist with transformation honesty. When association analysis reveals that a member hospital should close, does the relationship enable difficult conversations or prevent them?</p>
<h2 id="the-transformation-challenge">The Transformation Challenge<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-transformation-challenge">#</a></h2>
<p>RHTP invests $50 billion to transform rural health, not merely sustain existing arrangements. The program&rsquo;s logic assumes that current rural health infrastructure is inadequate and requires fundamental change. Some hospitals that exist today should not exist in their current form after transformation.</p>
<p><strong>Rural Emergency Hospital conversions represent the clearest example.</strong> Congress created the REH designation recognizing that some Critical Access Hospitals cannot sustain full inpatient services but should maintain emergency and outpatient capabilities. As of January 2026, 42 hospitals have converted to REH status nationwide. Many more are evaluating conversion.</p>
<p>Hospital associations have responded ambivalently to REH development. They advocate for improved REH reimbursement and regulatory clarity, legitimate policy work that serves hospitals considering conversion. But associations rarely proactively counsel members toward conversion. <strong>The decision to recommend that a member close its inpatient unit conflicts with the advocacy identity</strong> that sees hospital closure as failure.</p>
<p>Regional network development presents similar tensions. RHTP encourages hub and spoke arrangements where larger facilities provide specialty services while smaller facilities handle primary and emergency care. These arrangements can strengthen regional systems but reduce individual hospital autonomy. A spoke hospital that transfers complex cases to a hub may eventually question why it maintains capabilities it rarely uses.</p>
<p>Hospital associations have advocated for flexible network arrangements that preserve member autonomy. They resist models requiring facilities to cede services to hub institutions. <strong>The preference for voluntary coordination over directed integration reflects member interests in maintaining independence</strong>, even when directed integration might produce better community outcomes.</p>
<p>Workforce strategies create direct conflicts. RHTP supports growing the rural health workforce, but workforce strategies that concentrate specialists at hub facilities rather than distributing them across all hospitals threaten smaller facilities. If regional cardiologists practice at the hub, smaller hospitals lose the recruitment battles they were already losing. Associations generally advocate for workforce approaches that benefit all members, which may mean less effective approaches overall.</p>
<h2 id="state-hospital-association-landscape">State Hospital Association Landscape<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#state-hospital-association-landscape">#</a></h2>
<p>Hospital associations vary enormously in size, sophistication, and rural focus. Some associations maintain substantial rural programs with dedicated staff and significant resources. Others treat rural hospitals as a constituency among many, with limited specialized capacity.</p>

<p><strong>Rural focus categories reflect the proportion of association resources and attention dedicated to rural hospitals specifically.</strong> Primary focus associations have rural health as their core mission (TORCH serves only rural and community hospitals). Secondary focus associations maintain substantial rural programs within broader hospital representation. Tertiary focus associations address rural issues as one constituency among many.</p>
<p>The budget and staffing data reveal capacity constraints. Even well-resourced associations have limited rural-specific staff. <strong>TORCH&rsquo;s 18 dedicated staff represent exceptional rural focus</strong>; most associations assign fewer than 10 people to rural issues. These capacity limitations constrain the technical assistance associations can actually deliver.</p>
<p>RHTP subaward amounts reflect state decisions about association roles. Texas channels substantial funding through TORCH for data analysis and technical assistance. Mississippi relies heavily on association infrastructure given limited state agency rural health capacity. California and Ohio provide smaller association roles, preferring direct state implementation or alternative intermediaries.</p>
<h2 id="case-study-the-conversion-counseling-dilemma">Case Study: The Conversion Counseling Dilemma<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#case-study-the-conversion-counseling-dilemma">#</a></h2>
<p>Riverside Community Hospital (name changed) had served its West Texas community for 67 years when CEO Maria Gonzalez requested TORCH assistance in late 2024. The 25 bed Critical Access Hospital was losing $180,000 monthly. Three years of operating losses had depleted reserves. The medical staff had declined from 12 active physicians to 4, with the remaining doctors averaging 63 years old. <strong>The hospital maintained obstetric services that averaged 3 deliveries per month</strong>, each requiring on call coverage that exhausted the medical staff.</p>
<p>TORCH&rsquo;s financial analysis team conducted comprehensive assessment. The findings were unambiguous: <strong>Riverside could not sustain current operations</strong>. Inpatient utilization had declined 40% over five years as the county population aged and younger residents relocated. The payer mix had shifted toward Medicare, which reimbursed below cost. Even aggressive cost cutting could not bridge the structural deficit.</p>
<p>The analysis identified three options. Option one: continue current operations while seeking increased community support, accepting ongoing losses and eventual closure when reserves exhausted. Option two: convert to Rural Emergency Hospital status, maintaining emergency and outpatient services while eliminating inpatient care, reducing losses to approximately $40,000 monthly with enhanced REH reimbursement. Option three: close entirely and work with regional partners to establish alternative access points.</p>
<p><strong>The TORCH team faced the transformation dilemma directly.</strong> Their analysis clearly supported REH conversion as the most sustainable path. But recommending that a member hospital close its inpatient unit, eliminate obstetric services, and fundamentally change its community role conflicted with decades of association identity built on fighting hospital closures.</p>
<p>The team presented all three options to Gonzalez and the board, with detailed financial projections for each. They provided technical assistance on REH conversion requirements and connected Riverside with other hospitals that had converted. They facilitated conversations with the regional hub hospital about transfer protocols and specialist coverage.</p>
<p><strong>What TORCH did not do was clearly recommend conversion.</strong> The presentation framed conversion as one option among others, despite analysis showing it as the only sustainable path. Board members who wanted to preserve the hospital&rsquo;s traditional role found no clear guidance pushing toward difficult decisions.</p>
<p>Riverside&rsquo;s board ultimately voted to continue operations while pursuing community fundraising. Six months later, facing deepening losses and failed fundraising, the board revisited conversion. By then, two physicians had retired, emergency department volumes had declined further, and the conversion financial projections had worsened.</p>
<p><strong>The delay cost the community</strong>. Had TORCH clearly recommended conversion when the analysis supported it, Riverside might have transitioned with stronger financial position and better physician coverage. The association&rsquo;s reluctance to advocate for transformation it had analytically identified cost the community options.</p>
<p>TORCH staff members, interviewed confidentially, acknowledged the tension. &ldquo;Our job is to help hospitals, and sometimes helping means telling them hard truths,&rdquo; one senior staff member noted. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;re also accountable to a board of hospital CEOs who don&rsquo;t want to hear that their peers should close services. <strong>There&rsquo;s pressure, spoken and unspoken, to present options rather than recommendations.</strong>&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="alternative-perspective-the-necessary-infrastructure-defense">Alternative Perspective: The Necessary Infrastructure Defense<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#alternative-perspective-the-necessary-infrastructure-defense">#</a></h2>
<p>Critics of hospital association RHTP roles must contend with a practical reality: <strong>state agencies lack the relationships and credibility to implement transformation without intermediary support</strong>. Rural hospital administrators trust their associations in ways they do not trust state bureaucracies. This trust enables conversations that would not otherwise occur.</p>
<p>The strongest version of this argument holds that transformation requires hospitals to take difficult actions voluntarily. Regulators cannot force hospitals to convert, consolidate, or close except through indirect pressure. <strong>Voluntary action requires trusted advisors</strong> who can help hospital leaders see options, understand implications, and navigate change. Hospital associations have decades of relationship investment that state agencies cannot replicate.</p>
<p>The argument has merit. TORCH&rsquo;s relationship with Texas rural hospitals, built over 35 years, enables access that state agencies lack. Hospital CEOs share financial data with TORCH that they would not share with regulators. They attend TORCH conferences, participate in TORCH learning collaboratives, and call TORCH staff for advice. <strong>These relationships represent genuine infrastructure</strong> for transformation communication.</p>
<p>The counterargument is equally practical: relationships constrained by member advocacy may not serve transformation. A trusted advisor who cannot give honest advice is not actually helpful. <strong>If TORCH cannot recommend conversion when analysis supports it</strong>, the relationship value diminishes. Trust that depends on telling members what they want to hear is not the kind of trust transformation requires.</p>
<p>Evidence from RHTP implementation suggests both dynamics operate. Hospital associations have successfully facilitated transformation conversations that would not have occurred through state agencies alone. They have also softened transformation messages, delayed difficult recommendations, and prioritized member comfort over community need. <strong>Neither the romanticized view nor the cynical view captures the full picture.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Pass-through percentages indicate how much subaward funding reaches hospitals versus being retained by associations for administrative costs and staff.</strong> Higher pass-through suggests more direct hospital support; lower pass-through indicates more association-delivered services. Neither is inherently superior, but the variation reveals different implementation models.</p>
<p>Outcome accountability structures range from weak to moderate. <strong>No state examined requires associations to demonstrate transformation outcomes</strong> as opposed to transformation activities. Texas tracks technical assistance sessions delivered and hospital satisfaction, not whether assisted hospitals actually transformed. Mississippi counts conversion support activities, not whether supported hospitals made sustainable decisions.</p>
<p>This accountability gap reflects the member service tension. State agencies that require associations to demonstrate transformation outcomes create pressure for associations to push members toward change. <strong>Associations resist outcome accountability precisely because it would require advocacy-limiting honesty.</strong> States that want association cooperation avoid accountability structures that associations resist.</p>
<p>The resulting arrangements produce activity without guaranteed transformation. Associations deliver technical assistance sessions, quality improvement programs, and workforce development initiatives. Whether these activities produce actual transformation remains unmeasured.</p>
<h2 id="case-study-network-development-and-member-autonomy">Case Study: Network Development and Member Autonomy<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#case-study-network-development-and-member-autonomy">#</a></h2>
<p>The Upper Peninsula Health Network in Michigan illustrates how hospital association advocacy can shape RHTP implementation in ways that protect members while potentially undermining transformation.</p>
<p>Michigan&rsquo;s RHTP application proposed regional networks with <strong>clear hub and spoke designations</strong>. The application identified larger hospitals as hubs responsible for specialty services, complex care, and workforce concentration. Smaller hospitals would serve as spokes providing primary care, emergency stabilization, and transfer coordination. The network structure required spokes to forgo certain service development in favor of regional efficiency.</p>
<p>The Michigan Hospital Association raised concerns during application development. Several member hospitals designated as spokes objected to restrictions on their service development. <strong>They wanted to maintain options for future service expansion</strong> even if current utilization did not support those services. The association advocated for softer network structures that encouraged rather than required coordination.</p>
<p>The final application reflected association influence. Hub and spoke designations became &ldquo;network partnership levels&rdquo; without clear service restrictions. Hospitals could participate at varying levels based on self-selected roles. <strong>The transformation from mandatory to voluntary network structure preserved member autonomy</strong> at the cost of network clarity.</p>
<p>Implementation revealed the consequences. Two years into the network, supposed spoke hospitals had independently recruited cardiologists who competed with hub services. A spoke hospital that was expected to transfer complex cases instead invested in intensive care capabilities that duplicated hub capacity. Network coordination meetings became contentious as hospitals defended independent decisions that undermined regional planning.</p>
<p>The Michigan Hospital Association celebrated the network&rsquo;s flexibility. Member hospitals appreciated maintaining autonomy. State agency staff privately acknowledged that <strong>the network had not achieved the coordination RHTP envisioned</strong>. Resources had been distributed across facilities without creating the regional efficiencies that concentrated investment might have achieved.</p>
<p>Association staff defended their advocacy. &ldquo;We represent hospitals, and hospitals wanted flexibility,&rdquo; one staff member explained. &ldquo;Forcing consolidation that members oppose would have undermined the entire network. Better to have voluntary coordination than mandated structures that hospitals resent and resist.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>The alternative view holds that voluntary coordination produces voluntary non-coordination.</strong> Networks require discipline that voluntary arrangements cannot sustain. The association&rsquo;s successful advocacy for member autonomy may have prevented the transformation Michigan communities needed.</p>
<h2 id="when-hospital-associations-help-transformation">When Hospital Associations Help Transformation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#when-hospital-associations-help-transformation">#</a></h2>
<p>Despite the structural tensions, hospital associations contribute genuine transformation value under specific conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Peer learning facilitation</strong> represents associations&rsquo; clearest value-add. When hospitals see peers successfully navigating transformation, they become more willing to consider change. Associations convene peer learning opportunities that state agencies cannot replicate. TORCH&rsquo;s REH peer network connects converted hospitals with facilities considering conversion, providing practical guidance and emotional support that reduces conversion anxiety.</p>
<p><strong>Technical assistance on discrete tasks</strong> draws on association expertise without requiring advocacy-challenging recommendations. Associations help hospitals understand REH conversion requirements, navigate regulatory processes, and implement operational changes. This technical support adds value when the transformation direction is already determined; associations help with how, not whether.</p>
<p><strong>Data aggregation and benchmarking</strong> provide hospitals information for self-assessment. TORCH&rsquo;s hospital dashboard allows rural Texas hospitals to compare performance against peers, identifying improvement opportunities without association staff making explicit recommendations. The data may prompt transformation conclusions that association advocacy could not directly state.</p>
<p><strong>Policy advocacy for transformation-enabling policies</strong> aligns member interests with transformation goals. Associations advocating for enhanced REH reimbursement, flexible network regulations, and workforce support create conditions for transformation without requiring associations to push members toward change.</p>
<h2 id="when-hospital-associations-hinder-transformation">When Hospital Associations Hinder Transformation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#when-hospital-associations-hinder-transformation">#</a></h2>
<p>The same structural features that enable association value-add can obstruct transformation.</p>
<p><strong>Protection of members that should close or convert</strong> reflects the core tension. When association analysis identifies hospitals that cannot sustain current operations, advocacy identity prevents clear recommendations. The TORCH vignette illustrates how this protection delays difficult decisions that communities must eventually face anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Advocacy against regional consolidation</strong> reflects member preference for autonomy over efficiency. The Michigan vignette shows how association advocacy can reshape transformation proposals to protect member independence at the cost of regional coordination.</p>
<p><strong>Technical assistance focused on member survival rather than community need</strong> substitutes hospital-centered for community-centered analysis. Associations asking &ldquo;how can this hospital survive?&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;what does this community need?&rdquo; may perpetuate facilities that no longer serve community interests.</p>
<p><strong>Capture of transformation funding for member services</strong> redirects RHTP investment from transformation to sustainability. When associations interpret transformation broadly enough to include any hospital support, funding flows toward existing arrangements rather than change.</p>
<h2 id="assessment-and-recommendations">Assessment and Recommendations<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#assessment-and-recommendations">#</a></h2>
<p>Hospital associations are neither uniformly helpful nor uniformly harmful to RHTP transformation. <strong>Their value depends on how subaward structures align advocacy incentives with transformation goals.</strong></p>
<p>Evidence from RHTP implementation suggests:</p>
<p>The member service imperative genuinely constrains transformation honesty. Associations rarely proactively recommend facility closure or service elimination, even when analysis supports those conclusions. <strong>The structural tension is real, not imagined.</strong></p>
<p>Association relationships enable transformation conversations that would not otherwise occur. Rural hospitals trust associations in ways they do not trust state agencies. This trust has genuine value that states cannot easily replicate.</p>
<p>Current subaward structures do not resolve the tension. Activity-focused accountability allows associations to deliver services without demonstrating transformation outcomes. <strong>States get association cooperation at the cost of transformation accountability.</strong></p>
<p><strong>For State Agencies</strong></p>
<p>Structure subawards around transformation outcomes, not activity metrics. If associations receive funding for REH conversion support, measure conversions achieved, not consultations provided. Accept that outcome accountability will create association resistance and require negotiation.</p>
<p>Maintain direct state-to-hospital relationships alongside association channels. Do not become entirely dependent on association intermediation. Direct relationships provide alternative information sources and preserve state options if association performance disappoints.</p>
<p>Require associations to provide clear recommendations, not just options, when analysis supports specific conclusions. Fund analytical work only if associations commit to delivering honest findings even when findings challenge member interests.</p>
<p><strong>For Hospital Associations</strong></p>
<p>Acknowledge the member service and transformation tension explicitly. Associations that pretend the tension does not exist cannot manage it constructively. Honest acknowledgment enables governance conversations about how to balance competing obligations.</p>
<p>Develop transformation credibility through demonstrated willingness to deliver difficult messages. Associations that have successfully counseled members through closures and conversions have demonstrated that advocacy and honesty can coexist. Use these examples to build organizational capacity for transformation support.</p>
<p>Accept outcome accountability as the price of transformation funding. If associations want RHTP resources, they must accept measurement of transformation results. Resisting accountability undermines association claims of transformation value.</p>
<p><strong>For CMS</strong></p>
<p>Monitor association overhead and outcomes across states. Require states to report subaward structures, pass-through percentages, and transformation outcomes by intermediary type. Publish comparison data enabling state learning from peer approaches.</p>
<p>Require outcome evidence, not just participation documentation. Activity metrics allow associations to demonstrate effort without results. Transformation metrics require associations to demonstrate that their involvement produces community benefit.</p>
<p>Support direct-to-provider channels as alternatives to association intermediation. Technology enables state and federal agencies to reach providers directly. Maintaining these channels preserves options when association performance proves inadequate.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>Hospital associations bring genuine assets to RHTP implementation: member relationships, institutional knowledge, convening capacity, and technical expertise. <strong>These assets have real value that states cannot easily replicate.</strong></p>
<p>But associations also bring structural constraints: governance by member executives, revenue dependence on member satisfaction, and organizational identity built on member advocacy. These constraints limit association ability to serve transformation goals that threaten member interests.</p>
<p><strong>The evidence suggests that associations can help transformation under specific conditions</strong>: clearly structured outcome accountability, explicit acknowledgment of the advocacy tension, and state willingness to maintain alternative channels. Absent these conditions, associations tend toward member protection that may obstruct the transformation communities need.</p>
<p>The romanticized view that associations are essential infrastructure overlooks the advocacy constraints that limit transformation support. The cynical view that associations are merely captured rent-seekers ignores the genuine relationship value that enables transformation conversations.</p>
<p><strong>The honest view is more complex</strong>: hospital associations are potentially valuable transformation partners whose contribution depends on accountability structures that most states have not yet implemented. The question is not whether to involve associations, but whether states will structure involvement in ways that align advocacy incentives with transformation goals.</p>
