  "articleBody": "The Appalachian Mountains define America’s most coherent multi-state rural region and expose the fundamental mismatch between how federal programs flow and how rural challenges exist. RHTP funds arrive in 13 separate state allocations. Kentucky receives its award. West Virginia receives its own. Ohio, Tennessee, Virginia, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, South Carolina, Maryland, and New York each receive theirs. The mountain chain connecting these states, the shared extraction history that shaped them, the opioid crisis devastating them simultaneously, the workforce shortages affecting them identically: none of these regional realities have governance mechanisms to address them.\nThe Appalachian Regional Commission stands as America’s experiment in regional governance, created in 1965 with federal and state partnership to address Appalachian poverty. ARC has invested billions in roads, water systems, and economic development. It publishes the definitive research on Appalachian health. It convenes states and coordinates strategy. But ARC has no health authority. It cannot administer RHTP funds. It cannot require interstate health coordination. It cannot create the regional healthcare workforce pipeline that 13 separate state strategies cannot provide individually.\nThis article examines whether state-administered transformation can address a region that exists across state lines. The honest assessment: state administration cannot fully address regional challenges, but is the available mechanism. Improvements within state administration can help. Interstate coordination can supplement. But the governance mismatch between regional reality and state-based funding remains structural and largely unresolved.\nRegional Definition The ARC designates 423 counties across 13 states as Appalachian, stretching from southern New York to northern Mississippi. The region contains approximately 26.3 million people, though not all live in rural areas. Metropolitan centers including Pittsburgh, Knoxville, and Asheville exist within ARC boundaries. The health transformation challenge concentrates in Central Appalachia, the subregion encompassing eastern Kentucky, southern West Virginia, southwestern Virginia, and portions of Tennessee where extraction history and current distress intersect most intensely.\nARC classifies counties by economic status. In 2024, 81 counties qualified as economically distressed, ranking in the bottom 10 percent of all U.S. counties on indicators including poverty rate, per capita income, and unemployment. These distressed counties concentrate in Central Appalachia. Owsley County, Kentucky has the lowest median household income of any county in America. McDowell County, West Virginia lost 80 percent of its population since peak coal employment. Mingo County, West Virginia, Pike County, Kentucky, and Buchanan County, Virginia share a coalfield that ignores state lines but receives RHTP funds from three separate state administrations with no coordination requirement.\nThe mountains create regional coherence that state boundaries fragment. The Appalachian chain runs continuously from Maine to Georgia. The region shares topography (hollows and ridges that isolate communities), settlement patterns (Scots-Irish immigration creating cultural continuity), economic history (timber extraction followed by coal extraction followed by abandonment), and health outcomes (among the worst in America concentrated along state borders where neither state fully claims responsibility).\nState Appalachian Counties Appalachian Population Distressed Counties RHTP Award (Est.) Kentucky 54 1,180,000 38 $213M West Virginia 55 (entire state) 1,793,000 12 $198M Tennessee 52 2,987,000 6 $205M Virginia 25 398,000 5 $165M Ohio 32 2,088,000 8 $192M North Carolina 29 1,731,000 2 $175M Pennsylvania 52 3,053,000 0 $186M Georgia 37 1,124,000 2 $211M Alabama 37 2,967,000 2 $200M New York 14 958,000 0 $168M Other ARC States 36 8,051,000 6 Variable Historical Context Appalachian health outcomes reflect extraction economics that exported wealth and imported disability. Coal companies arrived in the late 1800s, purchased land and mineral rights, built company towns, and employed generations of miners. The arrangement was explicitly extractive: coal left the region by rail. Profits accrued to investors in Philadelphia, New York, and London. What remained were black lung disease, occupational injuries, environmental degradation, and communities structured around an industry that would eventually abandon them.\nThe company town model created healthcare dependency that the industry’s collapse eliminated. Company doctors provided care. Company stores extended credit. When mines closed, healthcare infrastructure disappeared with the economy that supported it. Communities that never developed independent healthcare systems found themselves without care and without the tax base to rebuild it.\nThe opioid epidemic represents the latest extraction. Pharmaceutical companies identified Appalachian pain clinics as marketing targets in the late 1990s. OxyContin sales representatives offered incentives to physicians prescribing in high volumes. The region’s occupational injury history, disability rates, and limited regulatory oversight created conditions that pharmaceutical marketing exploited. Purdue Pharma’s internal documents, revealed through litigation, show explicit targeting of Appalachian markets. The region received drugs. Pharmaceutical companies received profits. What remained were addiction, overdose deaths, and communities where substance use disorder became endemic.\nAccording to ARC’s 2025 Diseases of Despair report, Appalachia’s mortality rate from diseases of despair (overdose, suicide, alcoholic liver disease) exceeds the national rate by 37 percent. Central Appalachia’s rate is higher still. West Virginia leads the nation in overdose deaths per capita. Kentucky ranks in the top five. The epidemic’s geographic concentration follows the coal economy’s footprint, suggesting that current health crisis reflects historical economic structure.\nMargaret Harlan coordinates care for her family from a hollow in Breathitt County, Kentucky. Her father-in-law, 74, worked the mines for 32 years before black lung forced his retirement. His monthly disability check barely covers medications. Her husband, 48, injured his back in a surface mining accident in 2008 and was prescribed opioids that led to a decade of addiction. He has been in recovery for three years but requires monthly medication-assisted treatment appointments. The nearest MAT provider is in Hazard, 45 minutes away on winding roads. Her son, 26, works construction when work exists and has no health insurance. When he broke his arm last year, they drove to Lexington because the local emergency room closed in 2020.\nMargaret manages three generations of health needs with one working vehicle, no broadband for telehealth, and no primary care provider accepting new patients within 30 miles. She knows every back road, every clinic schedule, every pharmacy that stocks her father-in-law’s inhalers. Her expertise is survival logistics, not healthcare navigation. She has become what the formal system cannot provide: the coordinator, the advocate, the transportation network, the person who makes impossible access functional through relentless personal effort.\n“We don’t have healthcare here,” she says. “We have people figuring out how to get to healthcare somewhere else.”\nCurrent Conditions Health Outcomes: The Worst Corridors in Eastern America Central Appalachian health outcomes represent the floor for American rural health. The statistics describe a population dying younger, sicker, and more desperately than almost anywhere else in the country.\nMeasure Central Appalachia National Rural National Gap Life Expectancy 72.8 years 76.1 years 78.6 years -5.8 years Overdose Deaths (per 100K) 48.2 25.6 22.0 +26.2 Heart Disease Mortality (per 100K) 245 195 165 +80 Diabetes Prevalence 14.8% 11.2% 9.4% +5.4% Adult Smoking Rate 26.4% 18.5% 12.5% +13.9% Obesity Rate 38.2% 34.1% 30.4% +7.8% The life expectancy gap of nearly six years represents the cumulative impact of occupational disease, chronic conditions, substance use, and healthcare access barriers. A child born in McDowell County, West Virginia will live, on average, 21 years less than a child born in Fairfax County, Virginia, 350 miles away in the same state.\nHealthcare Infrastructure: Accelerating Collapse Hospital closures have concentrated in Appalachia over the past decade. The region’s hospitals operate on margins that cannot sustain disruption. Medicare and Medicaid reimburse below cost. Commercial insurance patients, those with employer coverage who generate operating margin, increasingly travel to urban facilities for care. What remains are facilities serving the sickest, poorest, oldest populations with payer mixes that guarantee financial loss.\nState Rural Hospitals at Risk Recent Closures Primary Care Shortage Kentucky 17 (25%) Tyler Memorial (2021) 254 HPSAs West Virginia 12 (35%) Multiple CAH conversions 58 HPSAs Tennessee 16 (44%) Jellico (2022) 86 HPSAs Virginia (SW) 6 (32%) Lee County (2013) 47 HPSAs Ohio (SE) 8 (24%) Nelsonville (2023) 128 HPSAs Appalachian Regional Healthcare (ARH) operates 14 hospitals across eastern Kentucky and southern West Virginia as the region’s largest health system. ARH functions as both provider and regional coordinator, but its authority ends at state lines. When ARH closes or converts a facility in Kentucky, the impact ripples into Virginia and West Virginia communities that used that facility, but ARH has no mechanism to coordinate cross-state response.\nWorkforce: The Recruitment Crisis Appalachian workforce shortages reflect both training pipeline failures and retention challenges. Young physicians graduate with $200,000 or more in debt. Rural Appalachian salaries cannot compete with urban compensation. Loan forgiveness programs exist but are underfunded and bureaucratically complex. The communities most needing providers are least able to attract them.\nPrimary care physicians per 100,000 population:\nCentral Appalachia: 38 National rural: 68 National: 95 The gap of 30 physicians per 100,000 compared to national rural means that Central Appalachia would need to approximately double its primary care workforce simply to reach national rural averages. Reaching urban levels would require tripling. No pipeline exists to produce this workforce within the RHTP timeline.\nThe Core Tension: State Administration vs. Regional Reality RHTP’s state-based structure cannot address Appalachian challenges that cross state lines. The examples are concrete:\nWorkforce pipelines serve states, not regions. Kentucky trains nurses who may practice in West Virginia. Ohio trains physicians who may serve Virginia. But no regional workforce strategy exists. Thirteen states compete for the same limited supply of Appalachian-origin clinicians willing to return home rather than coordinating to expand the supply.\nTelehealth licensing fragments by state. A psychiatrist in Pikeville, Kentucky cannot provide telehealth to a patient 15 miles away in Williamson, West Virginia without separate West Virginia licensure. The mountain between them is irrelevant to the licensing barrier. Regional telehealth networks that could efficiently serve dispersed populations across state lines face 13 separate licensing regimes.\nHospital referral patterns ignore state boundaries. Patients in extreme southwestern Virginia travel to Tennessee for specialty care. Patients in southern West Virginia use Kentucky facilities. Regional healthcare markets exist, but RHTP planning occurs at state level. No mechanism ensures that Kentucky’s RHTP investments account for West Virginia patients using Kentucky facilities.\nThe opioid crisis is regional, but response is state-based. Prescription patterns, drug supply chains, and addiction spread across the coalfields without regard to which state administers which county. West Virginia’s response cannot coordinate with Kentucky’s response cannot coordinate with Virginia’s response, though the populations share dealers, treatment facilities, and family networks.\nDr. Sarah Chen practices family medicine in Grundy, Virginia, the Buchanan County seat near the Kentucky and West Virginia borders. Her patient panel includes coal miners’ widows from three states, recovery patients who drive from Kentucky because Virginia has shorter wait times, and families who split their time between hollers on either side of arbitrary lines.\n“My patients don’t live in Virginia,” she says. “They live in the coalfields. Virginia just happens to be where my office sits.”\nWhen Kentucky closed its nearest substance use treatment facility, her panel’s recovery patients faced 90-minute drives instead of 30. When West Virginia expanded MAT availability, some of her Virginia patients switched to West Virginia providers for convenience. She coordinates with colleagues in two other states informally, sharing information when HIPAA permits, referring when she knows someone across the line.\n“We’ve built a regional network through personal relationships,” she explains. “But there’s no infrastructure supporting it. No shared records. No coordinated protocols. No regional workforce planning. Just doctors who happen to know each other trying to serve patients who don’t care which state they’re in.”\nShe sees RHTP as an opportunity and a frustration. Virginia’s RHTP application mentions Appalachia but proposes no coordination with Kentucky or West Virginia. Kentucky’s application addresses eastern Kentucky but not the patients it serves from Virginia. Three states will implement three strategies for one interconnected population.\nAlternative Perspective: The Regional Governance Imperative The strongest case for regional governance argues that ARC or a similar entity should administer Appalachian healthcare transformation directly. Regional challenges require regional response. State administration fragments what should be unified. The governance imperative would expand ARC’s authority to include health, allowing coordinated workforce development, telehealth policy, infrastructure investment, and service delivery across the 423-county region.\nThe argument has merit. ARC already produces the authoritative research on Appalachian health. It coordinates economic development across state lines. It has federal-state partnership structure and six decades of regional experience. Expanding ARC to administer health investment would match governance to regional reality.\nBut the counter-arguments are substantial. ARC’s effectiveness is debated; critics argue it has spent billions without transforming Appalachian outcomes. Creating new governance authority is beyond RHTP’s scope; Congress authorized state-administered transformation, not regional restructuring. States would resist ceding authority to regional entities. The timeline is too short; RHTP runs through 2030, and creating functional regional health governance would consume years before implementation could begin.\nThe honest assessment: Regional governance would better match Appalachian reality, but is not achievable within RHTP constraints. The imperative is valid. The mechanism is unavailable. Transformation must work within state administration while acknowledging its limitations.\nRHTP in the Region What States Propose Each Appalachian state’s RHTP application addresses its Appalachian counties to varying degrees. Kentucky explicitly prioritizes eastern Appalachian counties in workforce development and telehealth expansion. West Virginia’s entire application is effectively Appalachian given that all 55 counties fall within ARC boundaries. Ohio targets southeast Appalachian counties with community health worker deployment and primary care expansion. Tennessee mentions Appalachian counties but spreads resources across the state’s three distinct rural regions.\nNo state application proposes coordination with neighboring states for shared Appalachian challenges. RHTP’s state-administered structure neither requires nor incentivizes interstate coordination. States compete for federal attention and separate federal resources rather than coordinating for regional impact.\nWhat RHTP Provides Across the 13 Appalachian states, RHTP investments totaling approximately $2.4 billion will reach Appalachian counties through state-administered programs. Key elements include:\nWorkforce development in multiple states includes loan repayment, residency support, and community health worker training. But programs operate separately. A Kentucky-trained community health worker cannot easily transfer to West Virginia practice. Residency programs in Tennessee do not coordinate with programs in Virginia.\nTelehealth expansion receives funding in all Appalachian states, but licensing barriers remain. No state proposes regional telehealth compacts that would allow efficient cross-border practice.\nHospital stabilization efforts vary by state. Kentucky participates in the Pennsylvania Rural Health Model’s global budget demonstration. West Virginia has pursued Critical Access Hospital conversions. No regional approach addresses the interconnected hospital market.\nWhat RHTP Misses Regional workforce strategy. Appalachia needs an Appalachian medical school pipeline, an Appalachian nursing consortium, an Appalachian community health worker certification that transfers across state lines. No state can create these alone. RHTP’s state structure prevents collective action.\nCross-border care coordination. Patients using facilities in neighboring states need care coordination that follows them across state lines. Health information exchange, shared care protocols, and integrated referral networks require interstate infrastructure that RHTP does not fund.\nRegional addiction response. The opioid crisis spreads regionally. Treatment capacity, harm reduction, and recovery support require regional rather than state-by-state response. RHTP cannot create regional addiction strategy.\nRegional Strengths Appalachian communities possess resources that transformation can build on. Regional culture emphasizes mutual aid, family obligation, and community resilience. Kentucky Homeplace, created in 1994, trains community health workers from Appalachian communities to provide health and social services. The program has served over 202,000 residents with documented return on investment of $11.33 for every dollar spent. Similar community-based models could scale if resources permitted.\nAppalachian Regional Healthcare demonstrates regional thinking within available constraints. ARH coordinates care across eastern Kentucky and southern West Virginia, operating 14 hospitals with shared protocols and workforce development. ARH’s existence shows that regional healthcare organization is possible when a single entity can cross state lines.\nCommunity health centers in Appalachia have expanded significantly, providing primary care access where private practice cannot survive. Mountain Comprehensive Health Corporation in Kentucky, Cabin Creek Health Systems in West Virginia, and similar FQHCs serve as anchor institutions for community health. These organizations understand regional challenges and could coordinate regionally if governance permitted.\nKathy Deskins has worked for Big Sandy Health Care in eastern Kentucky for 22 years, starting as a front desk receptionist and now serving as community outreach coordinator. She grew up in Martin County, raised her children there, and knows three generations of families across five counties.\n“When I do outreach, I’m not representing some organization from somewhere else,” she says. “I’m Kathy from Martin County. People trust me because I’m from here. I understand what they’re dealing with because I deal with it too.”\nHer community health worker model embeds knowledge that no external intervention can replicate. She knows which families won’t come to clinic but will accept home visits. She knows which pastors can reach people in crisis. She knows the informal economy, the family feuds, the recovery networks, the transportation arrangements that make care possible or impossible.\n“They keep sending consultants to study us,” she observes. “They could just ask. We know what we need. We need what we’ve always needed: jobs, healthcare, and someone who understands that this is home, not a problem to be solved and left behind.”\nHer insight frames what transformation requires: investment proportional to extraction history, delivered through trusted community members, building capacity that remains when federal funding ends.\nTransformation Assessment What Transformation Requires Regional coordination mechanisms that RHTP structure cannot provide. Interstate compacts for telehealth licensing, workforce reciprocity, and care coordination would enable efficient regional response. CMS could incentivize such compacts without creating new governance structures.\nInvestment proportional to extraction history. Appalachia exported wealth for a century. Healthcare transformation should reflect that history. Current RHTP formulas distribute based on rural population, not historical disinvestment or current distress concentration.\nCommunity-based workforce. Appalachians trust Appalachians. Programs like Kentucky Homeplace demonstrate that community health workers from communities outperform imported professionals. Scaling community-based models requires investment in people from the region, not recruitment of people to the region.\nAddiction treatment integration. Behavioral health cannot remain separate from primary care in a region where substance use disorder touches most families. Integrated models that address addiction, chronic disease, and social needs together match Appalachian reality better than categorical programs.\nWhat Transformation Can Achieve Within the RHTP timeline, transformation can stabilize existing infrastructure, expand telehealth where licensing permits within state boundaries, deploy community health workers from communities, and integrate behavioral health into primary care settings. These improvements matter.\nTransformation can build capacity for future regional response even if regional governance does not emerge during RHTP. Strengthening FQHC networks, supporting ARH and similar regional systems, and training community-based workforce creates infrastructure that could coordinate regionally when mechanisms permit.\nWhat Transformation Cannot Achieve Transformation cannot create regional governance that RHTP structure prevents. Thirteen separate state strategies will produce thirteen separate outcomes, with coordination occurring only where states voluntarily cooperate.\nTransformation cannot reverse coal economy collapse. Healthcare investment addresses health consequences of economic decline but cannot restore economic foundation. Communities losing population, jobs, and young people will continue losing them regardless of healthcare availability.\nTransformation cannot immediately produce workforce in a region where recruitment has failed for decades. Pipeline programs require years to produce graduates. Loan forgiveness requires providers willing to practice in exchange for debt relief. The workforce crisis will persist beyond RHTP timeline.\nTransformation cannot resolve the opioid epidemic through healthcare intervention alone. Addiction involves economic despair, social isolation, trauma history, and drug supply that healthcare cannot fully address. Treatment and recovery support help, but comprehensive response requires economic development, law enforcement, and social services beyond RHTP scope.\nImplications and Recommendations For States\nStates containing Appalachian counties should explicitly target regional challenges in RHTP implementation. Kentucky’s prioritization of eastern counties provides a model. States should pursue voluntary coordination with neighboring states, sharing workforce development, pursuing telehealth compacts, and coordinating hospital referral network planning.\nFor CMS\nCMS should allow flexibility for multi-state approaches, permitting states to submit joint applications or coordinated strategies for shared regions. CMS should incentivize interstate coordination through favorable treatment of coordinated proposals. CMS guidance should recognize that state boundaries often do not match healthcare markets.\nFor ARC\nThe Appalachian Regional Commission should expand its health research and convening role, facilitating interstate health coordination even without direct program authority. ARC can document regional gaps, identify coordination opportunities, and provide technical assistance for states pursuing regional approaches. ARC’s POWER initiative for coal-impacted communities demonstrates capacity for health-adjacent investment.\nFor Regional Organizations\nAppalachian Regional Healthcare, community health center networks, and Area Health Education Centers should build regional coordination infrastructure that can function when governance mechanisms emerge.

<p>The <strong>Appalachian Mountains define America&rsquo;s most coherent multi-state rural region</strong> and expose the fundamental mismatch between how federal programs flow and how rural challenges exist. RHTP funds arrive in 13 separate state allocations. Kentucky receives its award. West Virginia receives its own. Ohio, Tennessee, Virginia, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, South Carolina, Maryland, and New York each receive theirs. The mountain chain connecting these states, the shared extraction history that shaped them, the opioid crisis devastating them simultaneously, the workforce shortages affecting them identically: none of these regional realities have governance mechanisms to address them.</p>
<p>The <strong>Appalachian Regional Commission</strong> stands as America&rsquo;s experiment in regional governance, created in 1965 with federal and state partnership to address Appalachian poverty. ARC has invested billions in roads, water systems, and economic development. It publishes the definitive research on Appalachian health. It convenes states and coordinates strategy. But <strong>ARC has no health authority</strong>. It cannot administer RHTP funds. It cannot require interstate health coordination. It cannot create the regional healthcare workforce pipeline that 13 separate state strategies cannot provide individually.</p>
<p>This article examines whether state-administered transformation can address a region that exists across state lines. The honest assessment: <strong>state administration cannot fully address regional challenges, but is the available mechanism</strong>. Improvements within state administration can help. Interstate coordination can supplement. But the governance mismatch between regional reality and state-based funding remains structural and largely unresolved.</p>
<h2 id="regional-definition">Regional Definition<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#regional-definition">#</a></h2>
<p>The <strong>ARC designates 423 counties across 13 states</strong> as Appalachian, stretching from southern New York to northern Mississippi. The region contains <strong>approximately 26.3 million people</strong>, though not all live in rural areas. Metropolitan centers including Pittsburgh, Knoxville, and Asheville exist within ARC boundaries. The health transformation challenge concentrates in <strong>Central Appalachia</strong>, the subregion encompassing eastern Kentucky, southern West Virginia, southwestern Virginia, and portions of Tennessee where extraction history and current distress intersect most intensely.</p>
<p>ARC classifies counties by economic status. In 2024, <strong>81 counties qualified as economically distressed</strong>, ranking in the bottom 10 percent of all U.S. counties on indicators including poverty rate, per capita income, and unemployment. These distressed counties concentrate in Central Appalachia. <strong>Owsley County, Kentucky has the lowest median household income of any county in America.</strong> McDowell County, West Virginia lost 80 percent of its population since peak coal employment. Mingo County, West Virginia, Pike County, Kentucky, and Buchanan County, Virginia share a coalfield that ignores state lines but receives RHTP funds from three separate state administrations with no coordination requirement.</p>
<p><strong>The mountains create regional coherence that state boundaries fragment.</strong> The Appalachian chain runs continuously from Maine to Georgia. The region shares topography (hollows and ridges that isolate communities), settlement patterns (Scots-Irish immigration creating cultural continuity), economic history (timber extraction followed by coal extraction followed by abandonment), and health outcomes (among the worst in America concentrated along state borders where neither state fully claims responsibility).</p>

<h2 id="historical-context">Historical Context<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#historical-context">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Appalachian health outcomes reflect extraction economics that exported wealth and imported disability.</strong> Coal companies arrived in the late 1800s, purchased land and mineral rights, built company towns, and employed generations of miners. The arrangement was explicitly extractive: coal left the region by rail. Profits accrued to investors in Philadelphia, New York, and London. What remained were <strong>black lung disease, occupational injuries, environmental degradation, and communities structured around an industry that would eventually abandon them</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>company town model created healthcare dependency</strong> that the industry&rsquo;s collapse eliminated. Company doctors provided care. Company stores extended credit. When mines closed, healthcare infrastructure disappeared with the economy that supported it. Communities that never developed independent healthcare systems found themselves without care and without the tax base to rebuild it.</p>
<p>The <strong>opioid epidemic represents the latest extraction</strong>. Pharmaceutical companies identified Appalachian pain clinics as marketing targets in the late 1990s. OxyContin sales representatives offered incentives to physicians prescribing in high volumes. The region&rsquo;s occupational injury history, disability rates, and limited regulatory oversight created conditions that pharmaceutical marketing exploited. Purdue Pharma&rsquo;s internal documents, revealed through litigation, show explicit targeting of Appalachian markets. The region received drugs. Pharmaceutical companies received profits. What remained were <strong>addiction, overdose deaths, and communities where substance use disorder became endemic</strong>.</p>
<p>According to ARC&rsquo;s 2025 Diseases of Despair report, <strong>Appalachia&rsquo;s mortality rate from diseases of despair (overdose, suicide, alcoholic liver disease) exceeds the national rate by 37 percent</strong>. Central Appalachia&rsquo;s rate is higher still. West Virginia leads the nation in overdose deaths per capita. Kentucky ranks in the top five. The epidemic&rsquo;s geographic concentration follows the coal economy&rsquo;s footprint, suggesting that <strong>current health crisis reflects historical economic structure</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Margaret Harlan coordinates care for her family from a hollow in Breathitt County, Kentucky.</strong> Her father-in-law, 74, worked the mines for 32 years before black lung forced his retirement. His monthly disability check barely covers medications. Her husband, 48, injured his back in a surface mining accident in 2008 and was prescribed opioids that led to a decade of addiction. He has been in recovery for three years but requires monthly medication-assisted treatment appointments. The nearest MAT provider is in Hazard, 45 minutes away on winding roads. Her son, 26, works construction when work exists and has no health insurance. When he broke his arm last year, they drove to Lexington because the local emergency room closed in 2020.</p>
<p>Margaret manages three generations of health needs with one working vehicle, no broadband for telehealth, and no primary care provider accepting new patients within 30 miles. She knows every back road, every clinic schedule, every pharmacy that stocks her father-in-law&rsquo;s inhalers. Her expertise is survival logistics, not healthcare navigation. She has become what the formal system cannot provide: the coordinator, the advocate, the transportation network, the person who makes impossible access functional through relentless personal effort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have healthcare here,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;We have people figuring out how to get to healthcare somewhere else.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Appalachian Regional Healthcare (ARH)</strong> operates 14 hospitals across eastern Kentucky and southern West Virginia as the region&rsquo;s largest health system. ARH functions as both provider and regional coordinator, but its authority ends at state lines. When ARH closes or converts a facility in Kentucky, the impact ripples into Virginia and West Virginia communities that used that facility, but ARH has no mechanism to coordinate cross-state response.</p>
<h3 id="workforce-the-recruitment-crisis">Workforce: The Recruitment Crisis<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#workforce-the-recruitment-crisis">#</a></h3>
<p>Appalachian workforce shortages reflect <strong>both training pipeline failures and retention challenges</strong>. Young physicians graduate with $200,000 or more in debt. Rural Appalachian salaries cannot compete with urban compensation. Loan forgiveness programs exist but are underfunded and bureaucratically complex. The communities most needing providers are least able to attract them.</p>
<p><strong>Primary care physicians per 100,000 population:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Central Appalachia: 38</li>
<li>National rural: 68</li>
<li>National: 95</li>
</ul>
<p>The gap of 30 physicians per 100,000 compared to national rural means that <strong>Central Appalachia would need to approximately double its primary care workforce</strong> simply to reach national rural averages. Reaching urban levels would require tripling. No pipeline exists to produce this workforce within the RHTP timeline.</p>
<h2 id="the-core-tension-state-administration-vs-regional-reality">The Core Tension: State Administration vs. Regional Reality<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-core-tension-state-administration-vs-regional-reality">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>RHTP&rsquo;s state-based structure cannot address Appalachian challenges that cross state lines.</strong> The examples are concrete:</p>
<p><strong>Workforce pipelines serve states, not regions.</strong> Kentucky trains nurses who may practice in West Virginia. Ohio trains physicians who may serve Virginia. But no regional workforce strategy exists. Thirteen states compete for the same limited supply of Appalachian-origin clinicians willing to return home rather than coordinating to expand the supply.</p>
<p><strong>Telehealth licensing fragments by state.</strong> A psychiatrist in Pikeville, Kentucky cannot provide telehealth to a patient 15 miles away in Williamson, West Virginia without separate West Virginia licensure. The mountain between them is irrelevant to the licensing barrier. Regional telehealth networks that could efficiently serve dispersed populations across state lines face 13 separate licensing regimes.</p>
<p><strong>Hospital referral patterns ignore state boundaries.</strong> Patients in extreme southwestern Virginia travel to Tennessee for specialty care. Patients in southern West Virginia use Kentucky facilities. Regional healthcare markets exist, but RHTP planning occurs at state level. No mechanism ensures that Kentucky&rsquo;s RHTP investments account for West Virginia patients using Kentucky facilities.</p>
<p><strong>The opioid crisis is regional, but response is state-based.</strong> Prescription patterns, drug supply chains, and addiction spread across the coalfields without regard to which state administers which county. West Virginia&rsquo;s response cannot coordinate with Kentucky&rsquo;s response cannot coordinate with Virginia&rsquo;s response, though the populations share dealers, treatment facilities, and family networks.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Sarah Chen practices family medicine in Grundy, Virginia</strong>, the Buchanan County seat near the Kentucky and West Virginia borders. Her patient panel includes coal miners&rsquo; widows from three states, recovery patients who drive from Kentucky because Virginia has shorter wait times, and families who split their time between hollers on either side of arbitrary lines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My patients don&rsquo;t live in Virginia,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;They live in the coalfields. Virginia just happens to be where my office sits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Kentucky closed its nearest substance use treatment facility, her panel&rsquo;s recovery patients faced 90-minute drives instead of 30. When West Virginia expanded MAT availability, some of her Virginia patients switched to West Virginia providers for convenience. She coordinates with colleagues in two other states informally, sharing information when HIPAA permits, referring when she knows someone across the line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve built a regional network through personal relationships,&rdquo; she explains. &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s no infrastructure supporting it. No shared records. No coordinated protocols. No regional workforce planning. Just doctors who happen to know each other trying to serve patients who don&rsquo;t care which state they&rsquo;re in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sees RHTP as an opportunity and a frustration. Virginia&rsquo;s RHTP application mentions Appalachia but proposes no coordination with Kentucky or West Virginia. Kentucky&rsquo;s application addresses eastern Kentucky but not the patients it serves from Virginia. Three states will implement three strategies for one interconnected population.</p>
<h2 id="alternative-perspective-the-regional-governance-imperative">Alternative Perspective: The Regional Governance Imperative<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#alternative-perspective-the-regional-governance-imperative">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>The strongest case for regional governance</strong> argues that ARC or a similar entity should administer Appalachian healthcare transformation directly. Regional challenges require regional response. State administration fragments what should be unified. The governance imperative would expand ARC&rsquo;s authority to include health, allowing coordinated workforce development, telehealth policy, infrastructure investment, and service delivery across the 423-county region.</p>
<p><strong>The argument has merit.</strong> ARC already produces the authoritative research on Appalachian health. It coordinates economic development across state lines. It has federal-state partnership structure and six decades of regional experience. Expanding ARC to administer health investment would match governance to regional reality.</p>
<p><strong>But the counter-arguments are substantial.</strong> ARC&rsquo;s effectiveness is debated; critics argue it has spent billions without transforming Appalachian outcomes. Creating new governance authority is beyond RHTP&rsquo;s scope; Congress authorized state-administered transformation, not regional restructuring. States would resist ceding authority to regional entities. The timeline is too short; RHTP runs through 2030, and creating functional regional health governance would consume years before implementation could begin.</p>
<p><strong>The honest assessment:</strong> Regional governance would better match Appalachian reality, but is not achievable within RHTP constraints. The imperative is valid. The mechanism is unavailable. Transformation must work within state administration while acknowledging its limitations.</p>

<h3 id="what-states-propose">What States Propose<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-states-propose">#</a></h3>
<p>Each Appalachian state&rsquo;s RHTP application addresses its Appalachian counties to varying degrees. <strong>Kentucky explicitly prioritizes eastern Appalachian counties</strong> in workforce development and telehealth expansion. <strong>West Virginia&rsquo;s entire application is effectively Appalachian</strong> given that all 55 counties fall within ARC boundaries. <strong>Ohio targets southeast Appalachian counties</strong> with community health worker deployment and primary care expansion. <strong>Tennessee mentions Appalachian counties</strong> but spreads resources across the state&rsquo;s three distinct rural regions.</p>
<p><strong>No state application proposes coordination with neighboring states</strong> for shared Appalachian challenges. RHTP&rsquo;s state-administered structure neither requires nor incentivizes interstate coordination. States compete for federal attention and separate federal resources rather than coordinating for regional impact.</p>
<h3 id="what-rhtp-provides">What RHTP Provides<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-rhtp-provides">#</a></h3>
<p>Across the 13 Appalachian states, RHTP investments totaling approximately <strong>$2.4 billion</strong> will reach Appalachian counties through state-administered programs. Key elements include:</p>
<p><strong>Workforce development</strong> in multiple states includes loan repayment, residency support, and community health worker training. But programs operate separately. A Kentucky-trained community health worker cannot easily transfer to West Virginia practice. Residency programs in Tennessee do not coordinate with programs in Virginia.</p>
<p><strong>Telehealth expansion</strong> receives funding in all Appalachian states, but licensing barriers remain. No state proposes regional telehealth compacts that would allow efficient cross-border practice.</p>
<p><strong>Hospital stabilization</strong> efforts vary by state. Kentucky participates in the Pennsylvania Rural Health Model&rsquo;s global budget demonstration. West Virginia has pursued Critical Access Hospital conversions. No regional approach addresses the interconnected hospital market.</p>
<h3 id="what-rhtp-misses">What RHTP Misses<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-rhtp-misses">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Regional workforce strategy.</strong> Appalachia needs an Appalachian medical school pipeline, an Appalachian nursing consortium, an Appalachian community health worker certification that transfers across state lines. No state can create these alone. RHTP&rsquo;s state structure prevents collective action.</p>
<p><strong>Cross-border care coordination.</strong> Patients using facilities in neighboring states need care coordination that follows them across state lines. Health information exchange, shared care protocols, and integrated referral networks require interstate infrastructure that RHTP does not fund.</p>
<p><strong>Regional addiction response.</strong> The opioid crisis spreads regionally. Treatment capacity, harm reduction, and recovery support require regional rather than state-by-state response. RHTP cannot create regional addiction strategy.</p>
<h2 id="regional-strengths">Regional Strengths<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#regional-strengths">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Appalachian communities possess resources that transformation can build on.</strong> Regional culture emphasizes mutual aid, family obligation, and community resilience. <strong>Kentucky Homeplace</strong>, created in 1994, trains community health workers from Appalachian communities to provide health and social services. The program has served over 202,000 residents with documented return on investment of $11.33 for every dollar spent. Similar community-based models could scale if resources permitted.</p>
<p><strong>Appalachian Regional Healthcare demonstrates regional thinking</strong> within available constraints. ARH coordinates care across eastern Kentucky and southern West Virginia, operating 14 hospitals with shared protocols and workforce development. ARH&rsquo;s existence shows that regional healthcare organization is possible when a single entity can cross state lines.</p>
<p><strong>Community health centers in Appalachia</strong> have expanded significantly, providing primary care access where private practice cannot survive. Mountain Comprehensive Health Corporation in Kentucky, Cabin Creek Health Systems in West Virginia, and similar FQHCs serve as anchor institutions for community health. These organizations understand regional challenges and could coordinate regionally if governance permitted.</p>
<p><strong>Kathy Deskins has worked for Big Sandy Health Care in eastern Kentucky for 22 years</strong>, starting as a front desk receptionist and now serving as community outreach coordinator. She grew up in Martin County, raised her children there, and knows three generations of families across five counties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I do outreach, I&rsquo;m not representing some organization from somewhere else,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Kathy from Martin County. People trust me because I&rsquo;m from here. I understand what they&rsquo;re dealing with because I deal with it too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her community health worker model embeds knowledge that no external intervention can replicate. She knows which families won&rsquo;t come to clinic but will accept home visits. She knows which pastors can reach people in crisis. She knows the informal economy, the family feuds, the recovery networks, the transportation arrangements that make care possible or impossible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They keep sending consultants to study us,&rdquo; she observes. &ldquo;They could just ask. We know what we need. We need what we&rsquo;ve always needed: jobs, healthcare, and someone who understands that this is home, not a problem to be solved and left behind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her insight frames what transformation requires: investment proportional to extraction history, delivered through trusted community members, building capacity that remains when federal funding ends.</p>
<h2 id="transformation-assessment">Transformation Assessment<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#transformation-assessment">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="what-transformation-requires">What Transformation Requires<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-transformation-requires">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Regional coordination mechanisms</strong> that RHTP structure cannot provide. Interstate compacts for telehealth licensing, workforce reciprocity, and care coordination would enable efficient regional response. CMS could incentivize such compacts without creating new governance structures.</p>
<p><strong>Investment proportional to extraction history.</strong> Appalachia exported wealth for a century. Healthcare transformation should reflect that history. Current RHTP formulas distribute based on rural population, not historical disinvestment or current distress concentration.</p>
<p><strong>Community-based workforce.</strong> Appalachians trust Appalachians. Programs like Kentucky Homeplace demonstrate that community health workers from communities outperform imported professionals. Scaling community-based models requires investment in people from the region, not recruitment of people to the region.</p>
<p><strong>Addiction treatment integration.</strong> Behavioral health cannot remain separate from primary care in a region where substance use disorder touches most families. Integrated models that address addiction, chronic disease, and social needs together match Appalachian reality better than categorical programs.</p>
<h3 id="what-transformation-can-achieve">What Transformation Can Achieve<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-transformation-can-achieve">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Within the RHTP timeline, transformation can stabilize existing infrastructure</strong>, expand telehealth where licensing permits within state boundaries, deploy community health workers from communities, and integrate behavioral health into primary care settings. These improvements matter.</p>
<p><strong>Transformation can build capacity</strong> for future regional response even if regional governance does not emerge during RHTP. Strengthening FQHC networks, supporting ARH and similar regional systems, and training community-based workforce creates infrastructure that could coordinate regionally when mechanisms permit.</p>
<h3 id="what-transformation-cannot-achieve">What Transformation Cannot Achieve<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-transformation-cannot-achieve">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Transformation cannot create regional governance</strong> that RHTP structure prevents. Thirteen separate state strategies will produce thirteen separate outcomes, with coordination occurring only where states voluntarily cooperate.</p>
<p><strong>Transformation cannot reverse coal economy collapse.</strong> Healthcare investment addresses health consequences of economic decline but cannot restore economic foundation. Communities losing population, jobs, and young people will continue losing them regardless of healthcare availability.</p>
<p><strong>Transformation cannot immediately produce workforce</strong> in a region where recruitment has failed for decades. Pipeline programs require years to produce graduates. Loan forgiveness requires providers willing to practice in exchange for debt relief. The workforce crisis will persist beyond RHTP timeline.</p>
<p><strong>Transformation cannot resolve the opioid epidemic</strong> through healthcare intervention alone. Addiction involves economic despair, social isolation, trauma history, and drug supply that healthcare cannot fully address. Treatment and recovery support help, but comprehensive response requires economic development, law enforcement, and social services beyond RHTP scope.</p>
<h2 id="implications-and-recommendations">Implications and Recommendations<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#implications-and-recommendations">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>For States</strong></p>
<p>States containing Appalachian counties should explicitly target regional challenges in RHTP implementation. Kentucky&rsquo;s prioritization of eastern counties provides a model. States should pursue voluntary coordination with neighboring states, sharing workforce development, pursuing telehealth compacts, and coordinating hospital referral network planning.</p>
<p><strong>For CMS</strong></p>
<p>CMS should allow flexibility for multi-state approaches, permitting states to submit joint applications or coordinated strategies for shared regions. CMS should incentivize interstate coordination through favorable treatment of coordinated proposals. CMS guidance should recognize that state boundaries often do not match healthcare markets.</p>
<p><strong>For ARC</strong></p>
<p>The Appalachian Regional Commission should expand its health research and convening role, facilitating interstate health coordination even without direct program authority. ARC can document regional gaps, identify coordination opportunities, and provide technical assistance for states pursuing regional approaches. ARC&rsquo;s POWER initiative for coal-impacted communities demonstrates capacity for health-adjacent investment.</p>
<p><strong>For Regional Organizations</strong></p>
<p>Appalachian Regional Healthcare, community health center networks, and Area Health Education Centers should build regional coordination infrastructure that can function when governance mechanisms emerge. De facto regional networks through professional relationships and organizational partnerships create foundation for formal coordination.</p>
