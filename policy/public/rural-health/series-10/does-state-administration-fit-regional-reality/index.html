  "articleBody": "Rural Health Transformation Project\nIntroduction The CMS analyst reviews RHTP applications from all 50 states. Each plan addresses “rural areas” as if they were homogeneous within state boundaries. Ohio’s application treats Appalachian counties the same as agricultural counties. Texas applies a single strategy to the Panhandle, the Piney Woods, and the border. Mississippi’s plan cannot distinguish between the Delta and the Black Belt. Tribal populations appear as demographic checkboxes rather than sovereign governments.\nShe pulls up a map showing regional health outcomes. The worst mortality corridors ignore state lines entirely. Central Appalachia spans Kentucky, West Virginia, Virginia, Tennessee, and Ohio. The Mississippi Delta spans Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana. The Black Belt crosses Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina. The Great Plains stretch across ten states. Each region is coherent in its challenges but fragmented in its governance.\nThe question she cannot answer: Can state-administered transformation address regional challenges that cross state boundaries, constitute distinct sub-state areas, or involve sovereign tribal nations?\nSeries 10 examined 18 distinct rural regions to answer this question. The answer is qualified and uncomfortable: state administration is an imperfect fit for regional reality, but is the available mechanism for most populations. Improvements within state administration can help. Interstate coordination can supplement. But the fundamental governance mismatch between regional challenges and state-based funding remains structural and largely unresolved.\nPart I: The Governance Mismatch RHTP flows through states because American federalism flows through states. The Constitution establishes states as the primary governance unit below the federal level. Health policy has followed this structure since Medicaid’s creation in 1965. CMS has no mechanism to fund regions, no pathway to bypass states, no authority to require interstate coordination.\nRural health challenges are often regional, not state-bounded:\nMulti-state regions share challenges that cross boundaries. Appalachia spans 13 states with a single opioid crisis, a shared extraction history, and coordinated need for workforce development that 13 separate state strategies cannot provide. The Mississippi Delta spans three states with identical poverty, maternal mortality, and infrastructure collapse requiring coordinated response no state can independently deliver.\nSub-state regions have distinct needs that state strategies flatten. Texas contains frontier High Plains, agricultural Piney Woods, and binational border, each requiring different approaches that a single state strategy cannot accommodate. Ohio’s Appalachian counties share more with West Virginia than with Ohio’s agricultural northwest.\nSovereign tribal lands cross 36 states with federal trust relationships that state administration cannot appropriately mediate. The Navajo Nation spans Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah. Standing Rock spans North and South Dakota. State-administered RHTP for sovereign nations represents a category error that better implementation cannot correct.\nClimate-threatened regions face viability questions that healthcare investment alone cannot address. Alaska Native villages experiencing coastal erosion may not exist at current locations by 2035. Great Plains communities depleting the Ogallala Aquifer face agricultural collapse within decades. Infrastructure investment assumes community continuity that climate change challenges.\nThe mismatch is structural, not incidental. RHTP’s designers did not overlook regional reality; they accepted state administration as the available mechanism despite its limitations.\nPart II: Cross-Regional Synthesis Series 10 examined 18 distinct regions. The following matrix synthesizes findings on state administration fit and regional response need:\nRegion States Core Challenge State Admin Fit Regional Need Appalachian Mountains 13 Multi-state fragmentation, opioid crisis Poor Very High Ozark Mountains 4 Policy invisibility, scattered identity Poor High Black Belt 8 Historical extraction, persistent poverty Poor High Mississippi Delta 3 Extreme poverty, maternal mortality Poor Very High Piney Woods 3 Regional invisibility, economic transition Poor Moderate Great Plains 10 Extreme depopulation, distance Poor High High Plains 5 Aquifer depletion, resource crisis Moderate Moderate Upland South 6+ Cultural resistance, coal transition Moderate Moderate Intermountain West 3 Federal land dominance, sparse population Moderate Moderate Rocky Mountain West 4 Amenity bifurcation, wealth disparity Moderate Moderate Upper Midwest 4 Manufacturing decline, aging Moderate Moderate Northern New England 3 Oldest population, progressive context Good Moderate Pacific Northwest Timber 2 Economic collapse, mill town decline Moderate Moderate Pacific Interior 2 Internal diversity, agricultural labor Moderate Moderate Texas-Mexico Border 1 + Mexico Binational reality, colonias Poor Very High Florida Rural 1 Climate vulnerability, migrant labor Good Moderate Alaska 1 Extreme isolation, climate threat Good (single state) Very High Tribal Lands 36 Sovereignty, treaty rights Poor Very High Patterns in State Administration Fit Good fit occurs when regional challenges align with state boundaries and states possess capacity and political will for response. Northern New England benefits from small-state coordination capacity, progressive politics, and regional coherence within manageable interstate relationships. Florida Rural exists entirely within one state. Alaska’s extreme conditions paradoxically create good administrative fit because the entire challenge falls within single-state authority, though the challenges themselves exceed what state-administered transformation can address.\nModerate fit occurs when sub-state regional targeting is possible but requires explicit state attention that may not occur. The Upland South, Rocky Mountain West, and Upper Midwest can be addressed through state strategies that recognize internal variation. Whether states actually target distinct sub-state regions varies. Texas’s RHTP application addresses border, Panhandle, and East Texas differently. Ohio’s application does not distinguish Appalachian counties from agricultural regions.\nPoor fit occurs when regional challenges cross state boundaries, involve sovereign governments, or require coordination mechanisms that do not exist. Multi-state regions like Appalachia, the Delta, and the Great Plains lack governance for coordinated response. Tribal lands require government-to-government relationships that state RHTP cannot provide. Binational regions like the Texas-Mexico border face challenges that domestic policy cannot fully address.\nRegional Response Need Very High regional response need indicates that transformation cannot succeed through state administration alone. These regions require governance mechanisms that do not exist or fundamental policy architecture changes beyond RHTP scope.\nHigh regional response need indicates that state administration produces fragmented response to coherent regional challenges. Voluntary interstate coordination could help but is not required and may not occur.\nModerate regional response need indicates that sub-state targeting within state strategies could address regional distinctiveness. Success depends on state recognition of internal variation.\nPart III: What Evidence Supports Series 10 analysis supports six core findings with varying confidence levels.\nFinding 1: State Administration Cannot Address Multi-State Regional Challenges Confidence: High\nThe evidence is consistent across regions. Appalachia’s 13-state fragmentation prevents coordinated workforce development, shared technology platforms, or aligned hospital network planning. The Delta’s three-state division means identical challenges receive three different responses with no coordination requirement. No multi-state region examined in Series 10 has adequate governance mechanisms for healthcare transformation.\nThe Appalachian Regional Commission demonstrates both possibility and limitation. ARC provides regional research, convening, and economic development investment. But ARC has no health authority. It cannot administer RHTP funds or require interstate health coordination. The model shows regional governance is possible; its limitations show current regional governance does not extend to healthcare.\nThe Delta Regional Authority has even less healthcare engagement than ARC. The Mississippi Delta’s transformation occurs through state RHTP without DRA coordination role.\nImplication: Multi-state regions require new governance mechanisms or accept fragmented response. RHTP cannot create regional governance, but CMS could incentivize interstate coordination through favorable treatment of coordinated proposals.\nFinding 2: Within-State Regional Variation Requires Explicit Targeting Confidence: High\nStates contain multiple distinct rural regions with different challenges. Evidence consistently shows that state strategies without explicit regional targeting treat distinct regions identically, applying approaches appropriate for some regions but not others.\nTexas’s RHTP application demonstrates explicit regional targeting: border, Panhandle, East Texas, and Central Texas receive differentiated attention. Kentucky’s application prioritizes Appalachian counties. These states recognize internal variation.\nOther states apply uniform approaches. Ohio’s application does not distinguish Appalachian southeast from agricultural northwest. Georgia’s application does not separate Black Belt southwest from Appalachian north. Uniform approaches disadvantage regions whose challenges differ from state averages.\nImplication: States should explicitly identify and target distinct regions within state strategies. CMS should require state plans to address within-state regional variation.\nFinding 3: Historical Understanding Must Inform Current Intervention Confidence: High\nRegional challenges have historical roots that shape present conditions and intervention possibilities. The Black Belt’s health outcomes reflect 400 years of plantation extraction. Appalachian health reflects coal industry exploitation and abandonment. Tribal health reflects colonization and treaty violation. Transformation ignorant of history repeats failures and generates community resistance.\nThe tension between historical depth and current intervention resolves through synthesis, not choice. Historical understanding should inform intervention design without paralyzing action. Black Belt transformation must acknowledge why the region differs, why standard approaches fail, why community distrust exists. That understanding shapes design without preventing action.\nImplication: RHTP implementation should acknowledge historical context shaping regional challenges and incorporate historical understanding into design rather than applying ahistorical universal templates.\nFinding 4: Place-Based Investment Is Appropriate for Some Regions, Not All Confidence: Moderate-High\nThe Great Plains and Alaska reveal the limits of place-based investment. Some communities cannot sustain healthcare infrastructure at any investment level. Population too sparse, distance too great, decline too advanced, climate threat too immediate.\nThe evidence suggests distinguishing between sustainable and unsustainable places, though criteria remain contested:\nSustainable indicators: Service area population above 5,000, no nearby alternative, economic diversification, stable or slowing decline, strong community institutions.\nUnsustainable indicators: Service area population below 3,000, alternatives within 50 miles, continued steep decline, collapsed institutions, climate viability questions.\nCommunities below sustainability thresholds may benefit more from enhanced transportation, telehealth, and relocation support than from facility investment that delays but cannot prevent closure.\nImplication: RHTP should develop and apply sustainability criteria distinguishing places warranting infrastructure investment from places warranting people-based support. Criteria should be transparent and shared with communities.\nFinding 5: Tribal Sovereignty Requires Government-to-Government Relationships Confidence: Very High\nTribal nations are sovereign governments with treaty-based healthcare rights, not demographic groups requiring state attention. State-administered RHTP for sovereign nations represents a fundamental category error.\nThe evidence from tribally-operated healthcare systems is clear: tribal self-determination produces better outcomes. Tribally-operated systems under 638 contracting outperform IHS direct service and dramatically outperform state-administered programs. RHTP could have aligned with this evidence through direct federal-tribal pathways. It did not.\nMulti-state tribal nations face additional fragmentation. Navajo Nation healthcare transformation receives RHTP dollars from Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah with no coordination mechanism. Pine Ridge receives funding from North and South Dakota. State administration fragments tribal healthcare that should be unified.\nImplication: RHTP requires policy changes beyond program scope. Direct federal-tribal RHTP pathway. Multi-state provisions for nations spanning boundaries. Tribal priority authority allowing tribes to define transformation rather than accepting state definitions.\nFinding 6: Climate Increasingly Shapes Regional Healthcare Viability Confidence: Moderate-High\nClimate change emerged as transformation factor across multiple regions. Alaska villages face relocation decisions within RHTP timeline. Great Plains communities depleting aquifers face agricultural collapse affecting community viability. Florida faces hurricane and flooding threats to healthcare infrastructure. Border regions experience extreme heat affecting population health.\nInfrastructure investment in climate-threatened locations requires viability assessment. Building a $10 million facility in a community that may not exist at current location by 2035 is not transformation; it is waste. Climate adaptation must inform infrastructure decisions.\nImplication: RHTP should integrate climate assessment into infrastructure investment decisions and permit climate adaptation as allowable expense.\nPart IV: What Evidence Questions Series 10 identified five questions where evidence remains insufficient for confident conclusions.\nQuestion 1: Can Regional Governance Expand? The ARC model demonstrates regional governance is possible. Could the model expand to other regions or to health specifically?\nWhat we know: ARC required Congressional authorization and sustained federal-state partnership. Replication would require similar political investment. The Delta Regional Authority exists but with less capacity. No regional health authority exists for any multi-state region.\nWhat we don’t know: Whether political will exists for regional health governance. Whether ARC’s economic development model translates to healthcare. Whether states would accept regional authority reducing state control.\nQuestion 2: Can Interstate Compacts Enable Multi-State Coordination? Interstate compacts govern nursing licensure, emergency management, and other cross-border functions. Could compacts enable regional health coordination?\nWhat we know: The Nurse Licensure Compact demonstrates interstate healthcare coordination is possible. Emergency Management Assistance Compact shows states can coordinate crisis response.\nWhat we don’t know: Whether compacts could encompass RHTP-scale transformation. Whether states would join health compacts requiring resource coordination. What compact structure would enable regional healthcare transformation.\nQuestion 3: Where Is the Line Between Sustainable and Unsustainable Places? Series 10 found some places cannot sustain healthcare infrastructure. But criteria for distinguishing sustainable from unsustainable communities remain contested.\nWhat we know: Communities below certain population thresholds, with steep decline, without economic diversification, facing climate threats struggle to sustain infrastructure regardless of investment.\nWhat we don’t know: Precise thresholds for sustainability. How to weigh different factors. Whether communities deserve voice in sustainability determination. How to communicate sustainability assessments without creating self-fulfilling prophecies.\nQuestion 4: How Should RHTP Engage Binational Challenges? The Texas-Mexico border reveals transformation’s limits at national boundaries. Health challenges cross the Rio Grande; healthcare policy stops there.\nWhat we know: Binational disease patterns require binational response. Tuberculosis, hepatitis, vector-borne disease ignore national boundaries. Border healthcare patterns include cross-border care seeking that domestic data cannot capture.\nWhat we don’t know: What RHTP can accomplish for binational challenges within domestic policy constraints. Whether federal agencies beyond CMS should coordinate border health transformation. What informal coordination is possible without international agreements.\nQuestion 5: Does Historical Acknowledgment Affect Transformation Effectiveness? Series 10 argued historical understanding should inform intervention design. But whether acknowledgment affects outcomes remains unclear.\nWhat we know: Communities with extraction histories distrust external programs promising transformation. Black Belt, Appalachian, and tribal communities have experienced federal programs that promised improvement and delivered harm.\nWhat we don’t know: Whether explicit historical acknowledgment in RHTP design improves community engagement and outcomes. Whether acknowledgment without material reparation is meaningful. How to operationalize historical awareness in program design.\nPart V: Alternative Perspective Assessment Series 10 surfaced competing views on regional analysis and governance. The following assessment evaluates each perspective’s validity and implications.\nThe Regional Romanticism Critique Argument: Regional analysis romanticizes places and peoples, celebrating cultural distinctiveness while excusing system failures. “Appalachians are resilient” becomes justification for not providing services. “Delta communities support each other” becomes excuse for formal system absence.\nAssessment: The critique has validity. Cultural celebration can substitute for structural investment. But the alternative, treating regions as pathological rather than distinctive, generates equal problems. The synthesis position: respect regional identity without using culture as excuse for structural neglect. Acknowledge what communities provide while identifying what they cannot provide for themselves.\nImplication: Regional analysis should balance identity respect with structural honesty.\nThe Structural Determinism View Argument: Regional health outcomes are structurally determined. History created conditions that constrain current possibility. No intervention within existing structures can overcome structural barriers.\nAssessment: Partially valid. Structure constrains but does not completely determine. Leadership, innovation, and choices matter within constraints. Cherokee Nation operates within the same structural constraints as other tribal nations but achieves better outcomes through organizational excellence. Vermont operates within same federal constraints as Mississippi but achieves different results through state choices.\nImplication: Acknowledge structural constraints while recognizing agency within constraints.\nThe Triage Necessity View Argument: Not all places can be saved. Some regions are beyond transformation through healthcare intervention. Honest policy would acknowledge this and focus resources where impact is achievable.\nAssessment: Valid for most extreme cases but ethically fraught. Triage logic treats places as expendable without considering people who live there. The strongest counter: even places that cannot sustain infrastructure contain people who deserve care. The question is not whether to abandon places but how to serve people in places that cannot sustain traditional infrastructure.\nImplication: Apply sustainability criteria while ensuring people in unsustainable places receive care through alternative mechanisms.\nThe Regional Governance Imperative Argument: State administration fundamentally cannot address regional challenges. Regional governance is not optional enhancement but necessary precondition for transformation.\nAssessment: Valid in principle, difficult in practice. Creating regional health governance requires Congressional action, sustained political will, and state acceptance of reduced authority. None is forthcoming. The realistic response: improve state administration while exploring voluntary interstate coordination, recognizing this achieves less than regional governance but more than current fragmentation.\nImplication: Pursue regional governance long-term while implementing improvements within current structures short-term.\nThe Internal Colonialism Frame Argument: Extraction regions experienced internal colonialism: external powers extracting resources while leaving damage. Appalachia, the Delta, the Black Belt, and tribal lands all fit this pattern. Healthcare crisis reflects colonial relationship.\nAssessment: Historically accurate. The frame correctly characterizes how extraction economies operated and what they left behind. Less clear for guiding current action. Acknowledging colonial history matters for understanding community distrust. But the frame does not prescribe specific interventions beyond reparation, which exceeds RHTP scope.\nImplication: Acknowledge colonial history shaping regional conditions. Focus intervention on what can change now.\nThe Sovereignty Priority View Argument: For tribal populations, sovereignty is non-negotiable foundation. Any transformation that undermines tribal self-determination is not transformation but continued colonization.\nAssessment: Fundamental for tribal engagement. Evidence strongly supports tribal self-determination producing better healthcare outcomes. RHTP architecture that routes tribal funds through states contradicts both sovereignty and evidence about what works.\nImplication: RHTP must respect, not circumvent, tribal sovereignty. Direct federal-tribal pathway is necessary, not optional.\nPerspective Evidence Assessment Implication for Action Regional Romanticism Critique Valid concern; culture celebration can excuse system failure Balance identity respect with structural honesty Structural Determinism Partially valid; structure constrains but doesn’t determine Acknowledge constraints; recognize agency within them Triage Necessity Valid for extreme cases; ethically fraught Apply sustainability criteria; ensure people receive care Regional Governance Imperative Valid but hard to implement Pursue long-term; improve within current structures Internal Colonialism Frame Historically accurate; less clear for current action Acknowledge history; focus on present intervention Sovereignty Priority Fundamental for tribal transformation RHTP must respect, not circumvent, tribal sovereignty Part VI: The Honest Assessment State administration is an imperfect fit for regional reality but is the available mechanism for most populations. Tribal lands require a fundamentally different approach: government-to-government relationship, not state administration. For other regions, improvements within state administration can help. Interstate coordination can supplement. But the fundamental governance mismatch remains.\nWhat RHTP Can Do Within-state regional targeting: States can prioritize specific regions within state strategies. Kentucky targeting Appalachian counties, Texas differentiating border and Panhandle, demonstrate possibility. CMS can require and incentivize such targeting.\nInterstate coordination: Voluntary coordination between states sharing regions is possible without new governance structures. Joint workforce development, coordinated telehealth platforms, aligned hospital network planning can occur through interstate agreement.\nCMS flexibility: CMS can allow multi-state applications for shared regions, favorable treatment for coordinated proposals, flexibility for regional approaches within state administration.\nRegional organization engagement: ARC, Delta Regional Authority, and other regional entities can play coordination roles even without direct RHTP authority. Technical assistance, research, convening functions can support transformation.\nTribal government-to-government relationships: Direct federal-tribal RHTP pathway, while requiring policy change beyond current program, is achievable through administrative action or Congressional direction.\nHistorical acknowledgment: Recognition of how history shapes present conditions can inform intervention design without requiring reparation RHTP cannot provide.\nClimate integration: Incorporating climate assessment into infrastructure investment decisions and permitting climate adaptation as allowable expense.\nWhat RHTP Cannot Do Create regional governance: New governance structures are beyond program scope. Regional health authorities would require Congressional authorization and sustained political investment RHTP cannot generate.\nForce interstate coordination: Coordination must be voluntary. CMS can incentivize but cannot require states to coordinate with neighbors.\nAddress binational challenges: International policy is beyond program authority. Border health challenges that cross national boundaries require diplomatic mechanisms RHTP cannot create.\nOverride tribal sovereignty: Tribal transformation must be tribal-controlled. State-administered RHTP cannot substitute for tribal self-determination, even with good intentions.\nReverse historical damage: Healthcare transformation cannot undo centuries of extraction and exclusion. Acknowledgment matters; reversal is impossible.\nControl climate: Adaptation is possible; prevention is not. RHTP can incorporate climate assessment into decisions but cannot address climate change itself.\nGuarantee sustainability everywhere: Some places cannot sustain healthcare infrastructure regardless of investment. RHTP can delay but not prevent decline in communities below viability thresholds.\nThe Core Limitation RHTP operates within governance architecture it cannot change. Federal programs flow through states. Regional challenges often do not. The mismatch is structural, not correctable through better program implementation.\nThe honest conclusion is that regional reality exceeds state administration’s capacity to address. Some regional challenges require regional response that current governance cannot provide. Improvement within constraints is possible; resolution is not.\nPart VII: Recommendations For States Target within-state regions explicitly. Identify distinct regions within state boundaries. Develop differentiated approaches for each. Avoid uniform state strategies that flatten regional variation.\nCoordinate with neighboring states sharing regional challenges. Pursue voluntary coordination on workforce development, telehealth platforms, hospital network planning, emergency services. Coordination requires no new authority, only political will.\nRecognize internal variation in state strategies. Appalachian Ohio differs from agricultural Ohio. Border Texas differs from East Texas. State plans should reflect these differences.\nEngage regional organizations and community voice. Involve communities in defining transformation priorities. Engage regional entities (ARC affiliates, Delta Health Alliance, regional FQHCs) as implementation partners.\nEstablish government-to-government relationships with tribal nations. Tribal nations within state boundaries are sovereign governments, not demographic groups. State RHTP engagement should respect sovereignty through direct tribal consultation and partnership.\nApply sustainability criteria transparently. Assess community viability honestly. Share criteria with communities. Enable informed planning rather than false hope.\nFor CMS Allow flexibility for multi-state regional approaches. Enable states to submit joint applications or coordinated strategies for shared regions. Provide favorable treatment for coordinated proposals.\nRequire state plans to address within-state regional variation. State applications should identify distinct regions and describe differentiated approaches. Uniform state strategies should receive additional scrutiny.\nDevelop direct federal-tribal RHTP pathway. Tribal nations should be able to receive RHTP funding through direct federal relationship rather than state mediation. This requires either administrative flexibility or Congressional authorization.\nIncentivize interstate coordination. Priority scoring, enhanced flexibility, or supplemental funding for coordinated multi-state approaches.\nPermit climate adaptation as allowable RHTP expense. Infrastructure investment in climate-threatened areas should include adaptation components. Viability assessment should consider climate projections.\nWeight allocation formulas for regional need. Current formulas advantage small states through equal distribution component. Additional weighting for regional crisis zones (Delta, Black Belt, Appalachia) would direct resources toward greatest need.\nFor Regional Organizations Expand health role where regional governance exists. ARC, Delta Regional Authority, and state university systems can provide technical assistance, research support, and convening functions for regional health coordination.\nFacilitate interstate coordination where governance does not exist. Regional organizations can broker voluntary coordination between states sharing regional challenges, even without formal authority.\nAdvocate for regional approaches in federal policy. Long-term regional governance requires political advocacy. Regional organizations are positioned to make the case for governance structures matching regional challenges.\nDocument regional challenges and effective responses. ARC’s health research demonstrates value of regional documentation. Similar efforts for Delta, Black Belt, and other regions would inform policy development.\nFor Tribal Nations Assert sovereignty in RHTP engagement. Tribal nations should engage RHTP on tribal terms, not as demographic groups accepting state definitions. Sovereignty is foundation, not option.\nSeek direct federal relationship rather than state mediation where appropriate. While state RHTP constrains current options, advocacy for direct federal-tribal pathway addresses long-term architecture.\nParticipate in regional coordination on tribal terms. Interstate and regional coordination may serve tribal healthcare needs. Participation should occur through tribal choice, not state direction.\nDocument tribal health system effectiveness. Evidence strongly supports tribally-operated healthcare producing better outcomes. Documentation strengthens the case for tribal-led transformation.\nPart VIII: Transition to Series 11 Series 10 examined whether state administration fits regional reality. The answer reveals fundamental governance mismatch that RHTP cannot fully address. Regional challenges cross boundaries that state administration cannot.\nSeries 11: Rural Economics will examine whether healthcare transformation can succeed without economic transformation. Series 10 repeatedly encountered the economic foundation question: declining populations, extractive economies, agricultural consolidation, climate threat. Healthcare transformation assumes communities can sustain healthcare investment. Economic decline challenges that assumption.\nThe transition question: If regional challenges exceed state governance and economic decline undermines community sustainability, what can healthcare transformation actually achieve?\nThe forthcoming economic analysis will examine rural economic trends, healthcare’s role in rural economy, and the relationship between economic and healthcare transformation. The answer will determine whether RHTP’s fundamental premise, that healthcare transformation can improve rural health outcomes, holds under economic conditions that constrain what transformation can accomplish.\nAppendix: Series 10 Article Summary Article Region Primary Tension Key Finding 10A Appalachian Mountains State vs. Regional 13-state fragmentation prevents coordinated response 10B Ozark Mountains Identity vs. Characterization Regional invisibility limits targeting 10C Black Belt Historical vs. Current 400-year extraction shapes current crisis 10D Mississippi Delta State vs. Regional Worst outcomes; three-state fragmentation 10E Piney Woods Regional vs. Scalable Economic transition requires regional approach 10F Great Plains Place vs. People Extreme depopulation limits place-based investment 10G High Plains Place vs. People Aquifer depletion threatens community viability 10H Upland South Identity vs. Characterization Cultural factors shape implementation acceptance 10I Intermountain West State vs. Regional Federal land dominance complicates state administration 10J Rocky Mountain West Concentration vs. Distribution Amenity bifurcation creates dual rural systems 10K Upper Midwest Historical vs. Current Manufacturing decline parallels Great Plains 10L Northern New England Regional vs. Scalable Progressive context limits transferability 10M Pacific NW Timber Historical vs. Current Mill town collapse mirrors coal country 10N Pacific Interior Regional vs. Scalable Internal diversity requires regional targeting 10O Texas-Mexico Border State vs. Regional Binational reality exceeds domestic policy 10P Florida Rural Place vs. People Climate vulnerability shapes viability 10Q Alaska Place vs. People Extreme conditions test all assumptions 10R Tribal Lands Sovereignty vs. Integration State administration is category error Sources Appalachian Regional Commission. “Health Disparities in Appalachia.” ARC, August 2017. arc.gov/report/health-disparities-in-appalachia/.\nAppalachian Regional Commission. “Appalachian Diseases of Despair: Update 2025.” ARC, July 2025.\nCenter for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform. “Rural Hospitals at Risk of Closing.” CHQPR, December 2025. chqpr.org/downloads/Rural_Hospitals_at_Risk_of_Closing.pdf.\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention. “National Vital Statistics System: Mortality Data.” CDC, 2025. cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/deaths.htm.\nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services. “Rural Health Transformation Program: State Applications.” CMS, 2025.\nChartis Center for Rural Health. “2025 State of the State: Rural Hospital Closures.” Chartis, February 2025.\nCounty Health Rankings. “2025 County Health Rankings.” University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute, 2025. countyhealthrankings.org/.\nDelta Regional Authority. “State of the Delta Report 2025.” DRA, 2025. dra.gov/research/state-of-the-delta/.\nFlowers, Catherine Coleman.

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#introduction">#</a></h2>
<p>The CMS analyst reviews RHTP applications from all 50 states. Each plan addresses &ldquo;rural areas&rdquo; as if they were homogeneous within state boundaries. Ohio&rsquo;s application treats Appalachian counties the same as agricultural counties. Texas applies a single strategy to the Panhandle, the Piney Woods, and the border. Mississippi&rsquo;s plan cannot distinguish between the Delta and the Black Belt. Tribal populations appear as demographic checkboxes rather than sovereign governments.</p>
<p>She pulls up a map showing regional health outcomes. The <strong>worst mortality corridors ignore state lines entirely</strong>. Central Appalachia spans Kentucky, West Virginia, Virginia, Tennessee, and Ohio. The Mississippi Delta spans Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana. The Black Belt crosses Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina. The Great Plains stretch across ten states. Each region is coherent in its challenges but fragmented in its governance.</p>
<p>The question she cannot answer: <strong>Can state-administered transformation address regional challenges that cross state boundaries, constitute distinct sub-state areas, or involve sovereign tribal nations?</strong></p>
<p>Series 10 examined 18 distinct rural regions to answer this question. The answer is <strong>qualified and uncomfortable</strong>: state administration is an imperfect fit for regional reality, but is the available mechanism for most populations. Improvements within state administration can help. Interstate coordination can supplement. But the fundamental governance mismatch between regional challenges and state-based funding remains structural and largely unresolved.</p>
<h2 id="part-i-the-governance-mismatch">Part I: The Governance Mismatch<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#part-i-the-governance-mismatch">#</a></h2>
<p>RHTP flows through states because American federalism flows through states. The Constitution establishes states as the primary governance unit below the federal level. Health policy has followed this structure since Medicaid&rsquo;s creation in 1965. CMS has no mechanism to fund regions, no pathway to bypass states, no authority to require interstate coordination.</p>
<p><strong>Rural health challenges are often regional</strong>, not state-bounded:</p>
<p><strong>Multi-state regions</strong> share challenges that cross boundaries. Appalachia spans 13 states with a single opioid crisis, a shared extraction history, and coordinated need for workforce development that 13 separate state strategies cannot provide. The Mississippi Delta spans three states with identical poverty, maternal mortality, and infrastructure collapse requiring coordinated response no state can independently deliver.</p>
<p><strong>Sub-state regions</strong> have distinct needs that state strategies flatten. Texas contains frontier High Plains, agricultural Piney Woods, and binational border, each requiring different approaches that a single state strategy cannot accommodate. Ohio&rsquo;s Appalachian counties share more with West Virginia than with Ohio&rsquo;s agricultural northwest.</p>
<p><strong>Sovereign tribal lands</strong> cross 36 states with federal trust relationships that state administration cannot appropriately mediate. The Navajo Nation spans Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah. Standing Rock spans North and South Dakota. State-administered RHTP for sovereign nations represents a category error that better implementation cannot correct.</p>
<p><strong>Climate-threatened regions</strong> face viability questions that healthcare investment alone cannot address. Alaska Native villages experiencing coastal erosion may not exist at current locations by 2035. Great Plains communities depleting the Ogallala Aquifer face agricultural collapse within decades. Infrastructure investment assumes community continuity that climate change challenges.</p>
<p>The mismatch is structural, not incidental. RHTP&rsquo;s designers did not overlook regional reality; they accepted state administration as the available mechanism despite its limitations.</p>

<h3 id="patterns-in-state-administration-fit">Patterns in State Administration Fit<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#patterns-in-state-administration-fit">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Good fit</strong> occurs when regional challenges align with state boundaries and states possess capacity and political will for response. Northern New England benefits from small-state coordination capacity, progressive politics, and regional coherence within manageable interstate relationships. Florida Rural exists entirely within one state. Alaska&rsquo;s extreme conditions paradoxically create good administrative fit because the entire challenge falls within single-state authority, though the challenges themselves exceed what state-administered transformation can address.</p>
<p><strong>Moderate fit</strong> occurs when sub-state regional targeting is possible but requires explicit state attention that may not occur. The Upland South, Rocky Mountain West, and Upper Midwest can be addressed through state strategies that recognize internal variation. Whether states actually target distinct sub-state regions varies. Texas&rsquo;s RHTP application addresses border, Panhandle, and East Texas differently. Ohio&rsquo;s application does not distinguish Appalachian counties from agricultural regions.</p>
<p><strong>Poor fit</strong> occurs when regional challenges cross state boundaries, involve sovereign governments, or require coordination mechanisms that do not exist. Multi-state regions like Appalachia, the Delta, and the Great Plains lack governance for coordinated response. Tribal lands require government-to-government relationships that state RHTP cannot provide. Binational regions like the Texas-Mexico border face challenges that domestic policy cannot fully address.</p>
<h3 id="regional-response-need">Regional Response Need<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#regional-response-need">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Very High</strong> regional response need indicates that transformation cannot succeed through state administration alone. These regions require governance mechanisms that do not exist or fundamental policy architecture changes beyond RHTP scope.</p>
<p><strong>High</strong> regional response need indicates that state administration produces fragmented response to coherent regional challenges. Voluntary interstate coordination could help but is not required and may not occur.</p>
<p><strong>Moderate</strong> regional response need indicates that sub-state targeting within state strategies could address regional distinctiveness. Success depends on state recognition of internal variation.</p>
<h2 id="part-iii-what-evidence-supports">Part III: What Evidence Supports<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#part-iii-what-evidence-supports">#</a></h2>
<p>Series 10 analysis supports six core findings with varying confidence levels.</p>
<h3 id="finding-1-state-administration-cannot-address-multi-state-regional-challenges">Finding 1: State Administration Cannot Address Multi-State Regional Challenges<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#finding-1-state-administration-cannot-address-multi-state-regional-challenges">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Confidence: High</strong></p>
<p>The evidence is consistent across regions. Appalachia&rsquo;s 13-state fragmentation prevents coordinated workforce development, shared technology platforms, or aligned hospital network planning. The Delta&rsquo;s three-state division means identical challenges receive three different responses with no coordination requirement. No multi-state region examined in Series 10 has adequate governance mechanisms for healthcare transformation.</p>
<p>The <strong>Appalachian Regional Commission</strong> demonstrates both possibility and limitation. ARC provides regional research, convening, and economic development investment. But ARC has no health authority. It cannot administer RHTP funds or require interstate health coordination. The model shows regional governance is possible; its limitations show current regional governance does not extend to healthcare.</p>
<p>The <strong>Delta Regional Authority</strong> has even less healthcare engagement than ARC. The Mississippi Delta&rsquo;s transformation occurs through state RHTP without DRA coordination role.</p>
<p><strong>Implication</strong>: Multi-state regions require new governance mechanisms or accept fragmented response. RHTP cannot create regional governance, but CMS could incentivize interstate coordination through favorable treatment of coordinated proposals.</p>
<h3 id="finding-2-within-state-regional-variation-requires-explicit-targeting">Finding 2: Within-State Regional Variation Requires Explicit Targeting<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#finding-2-within-state-regional-variation-requires-explicit-targeting">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Confidence: High</strong></p>
<p>States contain multiple distinct rural regions with different challenges. Evidence consistently shows that <strong>state strategies without explicit regional targeting treat distinct regions identically</strong>, applying approaches appropriate for some regions but not others.</p>
<p>Texas&rsquo;s RHTP application demonstrates explicit regional targeting: border, Panhandle, East Texas, and Central Texas receive differentiated attention. Kentucky&rsquo;s application prioritizes Appalachian counties. These states recognize internal variation.</p>
<p>Other states apply uniform approaches. Ohio&rsquo;s application does not distinguish Appalachian southeast from agricultural northwest. Georgia&rsquo;s application does not separate Black Belt southwest from Appalachian north. Uniform approaches disadvantage regions whose challenges differ from state averages.</p>
<p><strong>Implication</strong>: States should explicitly identify and target distinct regions within state strategies. CMS should require state plans to address within-state regional variation.</p>
<h3 id="finding-3-historical-understanding-must-inform-current-intervention">Finding 3: Historical Understanding Must Inform Current Intervention<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#finding-3-historical-understanding-must-inform-current-intervention">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Confidence: High</strong></p>
<p>Regional challenges have historical roots that shape present conditions and intervention possibilities. The Black Belt&rsquo;s health outcomes reflect 400 years of plantation extraction. Appalachian health reflects coal industry exploitation and abandonment. Tribal health reflects colonization and treaty violation. <strong>Transformation ignorant of history repeats failures and generates community resistance.</strong></p>
<p>The tension between historical depth and current intervention resolves through synthesis, not choice. Historical understanding should inform intervention design without paralyzing action. Black Belt transformation must acknowledge why the region differs, why standard approaches fail, why community distrust exists. That understanding shapes design without preventing action.</p>
<p><strong>Implication</strong>: RHTP implementation should acknowledge historical context shaping regional challenges and incorporate historical understanding into design rather than applying ahistorical universal templates.</p>
<h3 id="finding-4-place-based-investment-is-appropriate-for-some-regions-not-all">Finding 4: Place-Based Investment Is Appropriate for Some Regions, Not All<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#finding-4-place-based-investment-is-appropriate-for-some-regions-not-all">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Confidence: Moderate-High</strong></p>
<p>The Great Plains and Alaska reveal the limits of place-based investment. Some communities cannot sustain healthcare infrastructure at any investment level. Population too sparse, distance too great, decline too advanced, climate threat too immediate.</p>
<p>The evidence suggests <strong>distinguishing between sustainable and unsustainable places</strong>, though criteria remain contested:</p>
<p><strong>Sustainable indicators</strong>: Service area population above 5,000, no nearby alternative, economic diversification, stable or slowing decline, strong community institutions.</p>
<p><strong>Unsustainable indicators</strong>: Service area population below 3,000, alternatives within 50 miles, continued steep decline, collapsed institutions, climate viability questions.</p>
<p>Communities below sustainability thresholds may benefit more from enhanced transportation, telehealth, and relocation support than from facility investment that delays but cannot prevent closure.</p>
<p><strong>Implication</strong>: RHTP should develop and apply sustainability criteria distinguishing places warranting infrastructure investment from places warranting people-based support. Criteria should be transparent and shared with communities.</p>
<h3 id="finding-5-tribal-sovereignty-requires-government-to-government-relationships">Finding 5: Tribal Sovereignty Requires Government-to-Government Relationships<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#finding-5-tribal-sovereignty-requires-government-to-government-relationships">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Confidence: Very High</strong></p>
<p>Tribal nations are sovereign governments with treaty-based healthcare rights, not demographic groups requiring state attention. <strong>State-administered RHTP for sovereign nations represents a fundamental category error.</strong></p>
<p>The evidence from tribally-operated healthcare systems is clear: tribal self-determination produces better outcomes. Tribally-operated systems under 638 contracting outperform IHS direct service and dramatically outperform state-administered programs. RHTP could have aligned with this evidence through direct federal-tribal pathways. It did not.</p>
<p>Multi-state tribal nations face additional fragmentation. Navajo Nation healthcare transformation receives RHTP dollars from Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah with no coordination mechanism. Pine Ridge receives funding from North and South Dakota. State administration fragments tribal healthcare that should be unified.</p>
<p><strong>Implication</strong>: RHTP requires policy changes beyond program scope. Direct federal-tribal RHTP pathway. Multi-state provisions for nations spanning boundaries. Tribal priority authority allowing tribes to define transformation rather than accepting state definitions.</p>
<h3 id="finding-6-climate-increasingly-shapes-regional-healthcare-viability">Finding 6: Climate Increasingly Shapes Regional Healthcare Viability<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#finding-6-climate-increasingly-shapes-regional-healthcare-viability">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Confidence: Moderate-High</strong></p>
<p>Climate change emerged as transformation factor across multiple regions. Alaska villages face relocation decisions within RHTP timeline. Great Plains communities depleting aquifers face agricultural collapse affecting community viability. Florida faces hurricane and flooding threats to healthcare infrastructure. Border regions experience extreme heat affecting population health.</p>
<p><strong>Infrastructure investment in climate-threatened locations requires viability assessment.</strong> Building a $10 million facility in a community that may not exist at current location by 2035 is not transformation; it is waste. Climate adaptation must inform infrastructure decisions.</p>
<p><strong>Implication</strong>: RHTP should integrate climate assessment into infrastructure investment decisions and permit climate adaptation as allowable expense.</p>
<h2 id="part-iv-what-evidence-questions">Part IV: What Evidence Questions<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#part-iv-what-evidence-questions">#</a></h2>
<p>Series 10 identified five questions where evidence remains insufficient for confident conclusions.</p>
<h3 id="question-1-can-regional-governance-expand">Question 1: Can Regional Governance Expand?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#question-1-can-regional-governance-expand">#</a></h3>
<p>The ARC model demonstrates regional governance is possible. Could the model expand to other regions or to health specifically?</p>
<p><strong>What we know</strong>: ARC required Congressional authorization and sustained federal-state partnership. Replication would require similar political investment. The Delta Regional Authority exists but with less capacity. No regional health authority exists for any multi-state region.</p>
<p><strong>What we don&rsquo;t know</strong>: Whether political will exists for regional health governance. Whether ARC&rsquo;s economic development model translates to healthcare. Whether states would accept regional authority reducing state control.</p>
<h3 id="question-2-can-interstate-compacts-enable-multi-state-coordination">Question 2: Can Interstate Compacts Enable Multi-State Coordination?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#question-2-can-interstate-compacts-enable-multi-state-coordination">#</a></h3>
<p>Interstate compacts govern nursing licensure, emergency management, and other cross-border functions. Could compacts enable regional health coordination?</p>
<p><strong>What we know</strong>: The Nurse Licensure Compact demonstrates interstate healthcare coordination is possible. Emergency Management Assistance Compact shows states can coordinate crisis response.</p>
<p><strong>What we don&rsquo;t know</strong>: Whether compacts could encompass RHTP-scale transformation. Whether states would join health compacts requiring resource coordination. What compact structure would enable regional healthcare transformation.</p>
<h3 id="question-3-where-is-the-line-between-sustainable-and-unsustainable-places">Question 3: Where Is the Line Between Sustainable and Unsustainable Places?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#question-3-where-is-the-line-between-sustainable-and-unsustainable-places">#</a></h3>
<p>Series 10 found some places cannot sustain healthcare infrastructure. But criteria for distinguishing sustainable from unsustainable communities remain contested.</p>
<p><strong>What we know</strong>: Communities below certain population thresholds, with steep decline, without economic diversification, facing climate threats struggle to sustain infrastructure regardless of investment.</p>
<p><strong>What we don&rsquo;t know</strong>: Precise thresholds for sustainability. How to weigh different factors. Whether communities deserve voice in sustainability determination. How to communicate sustainability assessments without creating self-fulfilling prophecies.</p>
<h3 id="question-4-how-should-rhtp-engage-binational-challenges">Question 4: How Should RHTP Engage Binational Challenges?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#question-4-how-should-rhtp-engage-binational-challenges">#</a></h3>
<p>The Texas-Mexico border reveals transformation&rsquo;s limits at national boundaries. Health challenges cross the Rio Grande; healthcare policy stops there.</p>
<p><strong>What we know</strong>: Binational disease patterns require binational response. Tuberculosis, hepatitis, vector-borne disease ignore national boundaries. Border healthcare patterns include cross-border care seeking that domestic data cannot capture.</p>
<p><strong>What we don&rsquo;t know</strong>: What RHTP can accomplish for binational challenges within domestic policy constraints. Whether federal agencies beyond CMS should coordinate border health transformation. What informal coordination is possible without international agreements.</p>
<h3 id="question-5-does-historical-acknowledgment-affect-transformation-effectiveness">Question 5: Does Historical Acknowledgment Affect Transformation Effectiveness?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#question-5-does-historical-acknowledgment-affect-transformation-effectiveness">#</a></h3>
<p>Series 10 argued historical understanding should inform intervention design. But whether acknowledgment affects outcomes remains unclear.</p>
<p><strong>What we know</strong>: Communities with extraction histories distrust external programs promising transformation. Black Belt, Appalachian, and tribal communities have experienced federal programs that promised improvement and delivered harm.</p>
<p><strong>What we don&rsquo;t know</strong>: Whether explicit historical acknowledgment in RHTP design improves community engagement and outcomes. Whether acknowledgment without material reparation is meaningful. How to operationalize historical awareness in program design.</p>
<h2 id="part-v-alternative-perspective-assessment">Part V: Alternative Perspective Assessment<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#part-v-alternative-perspective-assessment">#</a></h2>
<p>Series 10 surfaced competing views on regional analysis and governance. The following assessment evaluates each perspective&rsquo;s validity and implications.</p>
<h3 id="the-regional-romanticism-critique">The Regional Romanticism Critique<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-regional-romanticism-critique">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Argument</strong>: Regional analysis romanticizes places and peoples, celebrating cultural distinctiveness while excusing system failures. &ldquo;Appalachians are resilient&rdquo; becomes justification for not providing services. &ldquo;Delta communities support each other&rdquo; becomes excuse for formal system absence.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment</strong>: The critique has validity. Cultural celebration can substitute for structural investment. But the alternative, treating regions as pathological rather than distinctive, generates equal problems. The synthesis position: respect regional identity without using culture as excuse for structural neglect. Acknowledge what communities provide while identifying what they cannot provide for themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Implication</strong>: Regional analysis should balance identity respect with structural honesty.</p>
<h3 id="the-structural-determinism-view">The Structural Determinism View<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-structural-determinism-view">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Argument</strong>: Regional health outcomes are structurally determined. History created conditions that constrain current possibility. No intervention within existing structures can overcome structural barriers.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment</strong>: Partially valid. Structure constrains but does not completely determine. Leadership, innovation, and choices matter within constraints. Cherokee Nation operates within the same structural constraints as other tribal nations but achieves better outcomes through organizational excellence. Vermont operates within same federal constraints as Mississippi but achieves different results through state choices.</p>
<p><strong>Implication</strong>: Acknowledge structural constraints while recognizing agency within constraints.</p>
<h3 id="the-triage-necessity-view">The Triage Necessity View<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-triage-necessity-view">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Argument</strong>: Not all places can be saved. Some regions are beyond transformation through healthcare intervention. Honest policy would acknowledge this and focus resources where impact is achievable.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment</strong>: Valid for most extreme cases but ethically fraught. Triage logic treats places as expendable without considering people who live there. The strongest counter: even places that cannot sustain infrastructure contain people who deserve care. The question is not whether to abandon places but how to serve people in places that cannot sustain traditional infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>Implication</strong>: Apply sustainability criteria while ensuring people in unsustainable places receive care through alternative mechanisms.</p>
<h3 id="the-regional-governance-imperative">The Regional Governance Imperative<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-regional-governance-imperative">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Argument</strong>: State administration fundamentally cannot address regional challenges. Regional governance is not optional enhancement but necessary precondition for transformation.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment</strong>: Valid in principle, difficult in practice. Creating regional health governance requires Congressional action, sustained political will, and state acceptance of reduced authority. None is forthcoming. The realistic response: improve state administration while exploring voluntary interstate coordination, recognizing this achieves less than regional governance but more than current fragmentation.</p>
<p><strong>Implication</strong>: Pursue regional governance long-term while implementing improvements within current structures short-term.</p>
<h3 id="the-internal-colonialism-frame">The Internal Colonialism Frame<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-internal-colonialism-frame">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Argument</strong>: Extraction regions experienced internal colonialism: external powers extracting resources while leaving damage. Appalachia, the Delta, the Black Belt, and tribal lands all fit this pattern. Healthcare crisis reflects colonial relationship.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment</strong>: Historically accurate. The frame correctly characterizes how extraction economies operated and what they left behind. Less clear for guiding current action. Acknowledging colonial history matters for understanding community distrust. But the frame does not prescribe specific interventions beyond reparation, which exceeds RHTP scope.</p>
<p><strong>Implication</strong>: Acknowledge colonial history shaping regional conditions. Focus intervention on what can change now.</p>
<h3 id="the-sovereignty-priority-view">The Sovereignty Priority View<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-sovereignty-priority-view">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Argument</strong>: For tribal populations, sovereignty is non-negotiable foundation. Any transformation that undermines tribal self-determination is not transformation but continued colonization.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment</strong>: Fundamental for tribal engagement. Evidence strongly supports tribal self-determination producing better healthcare outcomes. RHTP architecture that routes tribal funds through states contradicts both sovereignty and evidence about what works.</p>
<p><strong>Implication</strong>: RHTP must respect, not circumvent, tribal sovereignty. Direct federal-tribal pathway is necessary, not optional.</p>

<h2 id="part-vi-the-honest-assessment">Part VI: The Honest Assessment<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#part-vi-the-honest-assessment">#</a></h2>
<p>State administration is an <strong>imperfect fit for regional reality</strong> but is the available mechanism for most populations. Tribal lands require a fundamentally different approach: government-to-government relationship, not state administration. For other regions, improvements within state administration can help. Interstate coordination can supplement. But the fundamental governance mismatch remains.</p>
<h3 id="what-rhtp-can-do">What RHTP Can Do<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-rhtp-can-do">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Within-state regional targeting</strong>: States can prioritize specific regions within state strategies. Kentucky targeting Appalachian counties, Texas differentiating border and Panhandle, demonstrate possibility. CMS can require and incentivize such targeting.</p>
<p><strong>Interstate coordination</strong>: Voluntary coordination between states sharing regions is possible without new governance structures. Joint workforce development, coordinated telehealth platforms, aligned hospital network planning can occur through interstate agreement.</p>
<p><strong>CMS flexibility</strong>: CMS can allow multi-state applications for shared regions, favorable treatment for coordinated proposals, flexibility for regional approaches within state administration.</p>
<p><strong>Regional organization engagement</strong>: ARC, Delta Regional Authority, and other regional entities can play coordination roles even without direct RHTP authority. Technical assistance, research, convening functions can support transformation.</p>
<p><strong>Tribal government-to-government relationships</strong>: Direct federal-tribal RHTP pathway, while requiring policy change beyond current program, is achievable through administrative action or Congressional direction.</p>
<p><strong>Historical acknowledgment</strong>: Recognition of how history shapes present conditions can inform intervention design without requiring reparation RHTP cannot provide.</p>
<p><strong>Climate integration</strong>: Incorporating climate assessment into infrastructure investment decisions and permitting climate adaptation as allowable expense.</p>
<h3 id="what-rhtp-cannot-do">What RHTP Cannot Do<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-rhtp-cannot-do">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Create regional governance</strong>: New governance structures are beyond program scope. Regional health authorities would require Congressional authorization and sustained political investment RHTP cannot generate.</p>
<p><strong>Force interstate coordination</strong>: Coordination must be voluntary. CMS can incentivize but cannot require states to coordinate with neighbors.</p>
<p><strong>Address binational challenges</strong>: International policy is beyond program authority. Border health challenges that cross national boundaries require diplomatic mechanisms RHTP cannot create.</p>
<p><strong>Override tribal sovereignty</strong>: Tribal transformation must be tribal-controlled. State-administered RHTP cannot substitute for tribal self-determination, even with good intentions.</p>
<p><strong>Reverse historical damage</strong>: Healthcare transformation cannot undo centuries of extraction and exclusion. Acknowledgment matters; reversal is impossible.</p>
<p><strong>Control climate</strong>: Adaptation is possible; prevention is not. RHTP can incorporate climate assessment into decisions but cannot address climate change itself.</p>
<p><strong>Guarantee sustainability everywhere</strong>: Some places cannot sustain healthcare infrastructure regardless of investment. RHTP can delay but not prevent decline in communities below viability thresholds.</p>
<h3 id="the-core-limitation">The Core Limitation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-core-limitation">#</a></h3>
<p>RHTP operates within <strong>governance architecture it cannot change</strong>. Federal programs flow through states. Regional challenges often do not. The mismatch is structural, not correctable through better program implementation.</p>
<p>The honest conclusion is that <strong>regional reality exceeds state administration&rsquo;s capacity to address</strong>. Some regional challenges require regional response that current governance cannot provide. Improvement within constraints is possible; resolution is not.</p>
<h2 id="part-vii-recommendations">Part VII: Recommendations<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#part-vii-recommendations">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="for-states">For States<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#for-states">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Target within-state regions explicitly.</strong> Identify distinct regions within state boundaries. Develop differentiated approaches for each. Avoid uniform state strategies that flatten regional variation.</p>
<p><strong>Coordinate with neighboring states sharing regional challenges.</strong> Pursue voluntary coordination on workforce development, telehealth platforms, hospital network planning, emergency services. Coordination requires no new authority, only political will.</p>
<p><strong>Recognize internal variation in state strategies.</strong> Appalachian Ohio differs from agricultural Ohio. Border Texas differs from East Texas. State plans should reflect these differences.</p>
<p><strong>Engage regional organizations and community voice.</strong> Involve communities in defining transformation priorities. Engage regional entities (ARC affiliates, Delta Health Alliance, regional FQHCs) as implementation partners.</p>
<p><strong>Establish government-to-government relationships with tribal nations.</strong> Tribal nations within state boundaries are sovereign governments, not demographic groups. State RHTP engagement should respect sovereignty through direct tribal consultation and partnership.</p>
<p><strong>Apply sustainability criteria transparently.</strong> Assess community viability honestly. Share criteria with communities. Enable informed planning rather than false hope.</p>
<h3 id="for-cms">For CMS<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#for-cms">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Allow flexibility for multi-state regional approaches.</strong> Enable states to submit joint applications or coordinated strategies for shared regions. Provide favorable treatment for coordinated proposals.</p>
<p><strong>Require state plans to address within-state regional variation.</strong> State applications should identify distinct regions and describe differentiated approaches. Uniform state strategies should receive additional scrutiny.</p>
<p><strong>Develop direct federal-tribal RHTP pathway.</strong> Tribal nations should be able to receive RHTP funding through direct federal relationship rather than state mediation. This requires either administrative flexibility or Congressional authorization.</p>
<p><strong>Incentivize interstate coordination.</strong> Priority scoring, enhanced flexibility, or supplemental funding for coordinated multi-state approaches.</p>
<p><strong>Permit climate adaptation as allowable RHTP expense.</strong> Infrastructure investment in climate-threatened areas should include adaptation components. Viability assessment should consider climate projections.</p>
<p><strong>Weight allocation formulas for regional need.</strong> Current formulas advantage small states through equal distribution component. Additional weighting for regional crisis zones (Delta, Black Belt, Appalachia) would direct resources toward greatest need.</p>
<h3 id="for-regional-organizations">For Regional Organizations<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#for-regional-organizations">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Expand health role where regional governance exists.</strong> ARC, Delta Regional Authority, and state university systems can provide technical assistance, research support, and convening functions for regional health coordination.</p>
<p><strong>Facilitate interstate coordination where governance does not exist.</strong> Regional organizations can broker voluntary coordination between states sharing regional challenges, even without formal authority.</p>
<p><strong>Advocate for regional approaches in federal policy.</strong> Long-term regional governance requires political advocacy. Regional organizations are positioned to make the case for governance structures matching regional challenges.</p>
<p><strong>Document regional challenges and effective responses.</strong> ARC&rsquo;s health research demonstrates value of regional documentation. Similar efforts for Delta, Black Belt, and other regions would inform policy development.</p>
<h3 id="for-tribal-nations">For Tribal Nations<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#for-tribal-nations">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Assert sovereignty in RHTP engagement.</strong> Tribal nations should engage RHTP on tribal terms, not as demographic groups accepting state definitions. Sovereignty is foundation, not option.</p>
<p><strong>Seek direct federal relationship rather than state mediation where appropriate.</strong> While state RHTP constrains current options, advocacy for direct federal-tribal pathway addresses long-term architecture.</p>
<p><strong>Participate in regional coordination on tribal terms.</strong> Interstate and regional coordination may serve tribal healthcare needs. Participation should occur through tribal choice, not state direction.</p>
<p><strong>Document tribal health system effectiveness.</strong> Evidence strongly supports tribally-operated healthcare producing better outcomes. Documentation strengthens the case for tribal-led transformation.</p>
<h2 id="part-viii-transition-to-series-11">Part VIII: Transition to Series 11<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#part-viii-transition-to-series-11">#</a></h2>
<p>Series 10 examined whether state administration fits regional reality. The answer reveals fundamental governance mismatch that RHTP cannot fully address. Regional challenges cross boundaries that state administration cannot.</p>
<p><strong>Series 11: Rural Economics</strong> will examine whether healthcare transformation can succeed without economic transformation. Series 10 repeatedly encountered the economic foundation question: declining populations, extractive economies, agricultural consolidation, climate threat. Healthcare transformation assumes communities can sustain healthcare investment. Economic decline challenges that assumption.</p>
<p>The transition question: <strong>If regional challenges exceed state governance and economic decline undermines community sustainability, what can healthcare transformation actually achieve?</strong></p>
<p>The forthcoming economic analysis will examine rural economic trends, healthcare&rsquo;s role in rural economy, and the relationship between economic and healthcare transformation. The answer will determine whether RHTP&rsquo;s fundamental premise, that healthcare transformation can improve rural health outcomes, holds under economic conditions that constrain what transformation can accomplish.</p>
