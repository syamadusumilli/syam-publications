  "articleBody": "Technology and capital alone cannot transform rural health. The inverse hub model (14A) provides a delivery architecture. AI services (14B) extend professional capacity. Local workforce (14C) creates employment. Service centers (14D) establish physical presence. Sovereign investment (14E) provides patient capital. But governance determines whether transformation serves communities or extracts from them. Who makes decisions? Who captures value? Who bears accountability when things go wrong?\nRural communities have experienced the consequences of governance misalignment for decades. Hospital systems headquartered hundreds of miles away acquire local facilities, then close service lines that do not meet corporate return requirements. Investor-owned chains extract revenue while deferring maintenance and reducing staff. Government programs impose reporting requirements without providing resources for compliance. Communities have responsibility for their health outcomes without authority over the systems that produce them.\nAlternative architecture requires governance structures designed for rural sustainability rather than urban scale economics. This article examines four governance models that could align control, benefit, and accountability: the rural commons, the agricultural health cooperative, the distributed campus, and the innovation zone. Each offers different tradeoffs between community control, operational capacity, and scale efficiency. The analysis draws from existing examples where community governance has succeeded and from failures that illuminate what governance design must avoid.\nThe Current Governance Failure Rural health governance fails along predictable patterns. Understanding these failures guides the design of alternatives.\nHealth system acquisition extracts rather than invests. When regional or national health systems acquire rural hospitals, the transaction often promises capital investment and service expansion. Reality frequently delivers the opposite. A RAND Corporation analysis found that rural hospitals joining health systems experienced reduced access to care compared to independent hospitals. Affiliated hospitals reduced service lines, closed units, and eliminated programs that did not contribute to system-wide financial performance. The logic is straightforward: health systems optimize portfolios, directing capital toward facilities with higher returns. Rural hospitals rarely win that competition.\nThe problem is not malicious intent but structural incentive. System executives have fiduciary obligations to optimize system performance, not to sustain unprofitable rural facilities. When system strategy conflicts with local need, system strategy wins. Rural communities lose control when they accept acquisition, trading immediate financial relief for long-term subordination to priorities set elsewhere.\nInvestor ownership prioritizes extraction. Private equity acquisition of healthcare facilities has increased dramatically, with predictable consequences for quality and access. Investor-owned facilities face pressure to maximize cash flow for distribution to investors, creating incentives to reduce staffing, defer maintenance, and eliminate services that generate community benefit but insufficient profit. When private equity acquires rural facilities, the ownership structure explicitly prioritizes financial return over community service.\nGovernment programs impose without empowering. Federal and state rural health programs create funding streams with compliance requirements that consume administrative capacity without transferring meaningful authority. Critical Access Hospitals must meet federal conditions of participation regardless of whether those conditions make sense for their communities. RHTP requires states to submit applications, plans, and reports demonstrating compliance with federal priorities. Communities receive funding but not autonomy; they implement programs designed elsewhere rather than solutions they develop.\nNonprofit governance often lacks community accountability. Many rural hospitals operate as nonprofit organizations with community benefit obligations. In theory, nonprofit status aligns governance with community interest. In practice, nonprofit boards often become self-perpetuating bodies disconnected from the communities they nominally serve. Board members may be appointed based on donor relationships, professional networks, or historical membership rather than community representation. Governance structures designed decades ago for different circumstances persist without adaptation.\nCommunities have responsibility without authority. When rural hospitals close, communities bear the consequences: longer travel times for emergency care, economic disruption from job losses, reduced attractiveness for employers and residents. But communities typically have no governance role in the decisions that produce these consequences. They are stakeholders affected by decisions rather than participants making them.\nModel 1: The Rural Commons The rural commons adapts traditional commons governance to healthcare, treating health services as shared community resources managed collectively rather than private goods traded in markets.\nCore Concept\nCommons governance emerged historically for managing shared resources where neither private ownership nor state control produced sustainable outcomes. Fishing grounds, irrigation systems, grazing lands, and forests have been successfully governed through commons arrangements where users collectively establish rules, monitor compliance, and adapt management to changing conditions. The insight is that communities can govern shared resources effectively when governance structures align decision authority with stake in outcomes.\nRural health meets the conditions that favor commons governance. Services are locally bounded; what happens in one community matters primarily to that community. Users are identifiable and relatively stable; rural populations have lower mobility than urban populations. Relationships are repeated; people interact with providers over years and decades. Information about quality and need flows through community networks. These conditions enable the trust and reciprocity that commons governance requires.\nStructural Specifications\nDimension Specification Membership All community residents; voluntary enrollment with sliding-scale contribution Ownership Community members hold voting shares; shares non-transferable Governance Local board elected by members; regional network provides technical support Services Comprehensive: primary care, behavioral health, dental, social services, legal/financial Workforce CHWs and support staff are community employees; professionals contracted to commons Funding Member contributions + Medicaid/Medicare + grants + earned revenue Risk management Shared across regional commons network through mutual aid agreements Membership creates stake. Unlike traditional nonprofit structures where community members have no formal relationship to governance, commons membership connects contribution to voice. Members pay according to ability, creating financial stake regardless of income level. Members vote on board composition and major policy decisions, creating democratic accountability.\nThe commons does not employ physicians directly. Professionals are contracted through regional networks or individual arrangements, preserving professional autonomy while ensuring community control over service priorities. The commons decides what services to offer and how to allocate resources; professionals decide how to practice within those parameters.\nRegional networks provide services that individual commons cannot achieve independently: risk pooling, professional recruitment, technology platforms, purchasing, and regulatory compliance support. Commons affiliate horizontally with peers rather than vertically with corporate systems, maintaining local control while accessing scale benefits.\nStrengths and Limitations\nCommons governance offers democratic control that no other model matches. Members set priorities, elect leadership, and hold governance accountable. Service integration across health, behavioral health, dental, and social services occurs naturally because the same community governance oversees all domains. Surplus returns to community benefit rather than external shareholders.\nLimitations are significant. Governance complexity requires engaged membership and capable leadership; communities with low civic capacity may struggle. Risk of elite capture exists when influential community members dominate governance despite democratic structures. Formation requires substantial organizing effort and technical assistance that may not be available. The model has limited precedent in American healthcare, creating uncertainty about regulatory treatment and operational viability.\nExisting Examples\nDirect precedents in American healthcare are limited, but adjacent models provide evidence. Community health centers operate with board requirements that mandate patient majority representation, creating governance closer to commons principles than typical nonprofit structures. Rural electric cooperatives demonstrate that commons-like governance can operate successfully at significant scale for essential services; over 900 rural electric cooperatives serve 42 million Americans through member-owned structures.\nModel 2: The Agricultural Health Cooperative The agricultural cooperative model applies proven rural cooperative structures to healthcare, building on the cooperative tradition that already provides electricity, telecommunications, credit, and marketing services in rural America.\nCore Concept\nRural cooperatives emerged in the early twentieth century when private markets failed to serve dispersed agricultural communities. Farmers could not individually afford electric service, access credit on reasonable terms, or market products competitively. Cooperative structures enabled collective action: farmers pooled resources, shared risk, and created enterprises they controlled democratically.\nThe Rural Electrification Administration catalyzed rural electric cooperative formation in the 1930s by providing capital and technical assistance. Within decades, cooperatives had electrified rural America where private utilities refused to invest. The same model could apply to healthcare: communities that cannot attract private investment in health services might create cooperative enterprises that they own and govern.\nStructural Specifications\nDimension Specification Membership Service users become members through subscription Ownership Member-owned, one-member-one-vote regardless of usage or contribution Governance Elected board sets policy; professional management handles operations Services Determined by member needs assessment; comprehensive or specialized Workforce Cooperative employs or contracts based on member-determined needs Funding Member subscriptions + service revenue + Medicaid/Medicare + cooperative financing Risk management Federation provides reinsurance, technical assistance, and economies of scale The cooperative differs from the commons primarily in formalization and business structure. Cooperatives operate as legal business entities with established corporate forms, regulatory pathways, and financing mechanisms. The National Cooperative Bank and other cooperative lenders provide capital; cooperative development organizations provide technical assistance; cooperative law is well-established.\nMember subscription creates both financial stake and service access. Unlike insurance premiums that flow to corporate shareholders, cooperative subscriptions remain in the enterprise and return to members as patronage dividends when the cooperative generates surplus. This structure aligns member and organizational interests: members benefit when the cooperative succeeds.\nProfessional management distinguishes cooperatives from pure democratic governance. Members elect boards that set policy and hire professional managers who handle operations. This separation preserves democratic control while ensuring operational competence. Rural electric cooperatives have operated successfully for decades with this structure.\nFederation and Affiliation\nIndividual cooperatives affiliate with federations that provide services impossible at single-cooperative scale:\nFederation Service Function Risk pooling Aggregate risk across cooperatives for insurance and reinsurance Technology platforms Develop shared EHR, telehealth, and coordination systems Professional recruitment Recruit and credential providers serving multiple cooperatives Purchasing Negotiate volume discounts on supplies, equipment, pharmaceuticals Regulatory compliance Provide compliance support, represent cooperatives in policy processes Capital access Channel cooperative lending to member cooperatives Federations enable cooperatives to access scale benefits while preserving local control. The National Rural Electric Cooperative Association demonstrates this model: individual cooperatives remain independent while the national association provides services, advocacy, and coordination.\nStrengths and Limitations\nCooperatives offer proven rural viability. The model has worked for electricity, telecommunications, credit, and marketing in rural settings for nearly a century. Regulatory and financing pathways are established. Member alignment ensures that governance serves user interests.\nLimitations include formation complexity: creating a cooperative requires substantial organizing, legal work, and initial capitalization. Cooperative decision-making can be slow when consensus proves elusive. Capital access remains challenging despite cooperative lenders; health cooperatives have limited track record that makes lenders cautious. State cooperative law varies, creating regulatory uncertainty in some jurisdictions.\nExisting Examples\nGroup Health Cooperative of Puget Sound operated as a consumer cooperative for decades before Permanente acquisition. HealthPartners in Minnesota maintains cooperative governance. Rural Wisconsin Health Cooperative provides network services to member hospitals through cooperative structure. These examples demonstrate that cooperative models can operate in healthcare at significant scale.\nModel 3: The Distributed Campus The distributed campus model creates unified governance across multiple locations, treating the region as a single campus with differentiated facilities rather than separate institutions competing or failing independently.\nCore Concept\nRural areas contain multiple small facilities, each struggling for independent viability. Critical access hospitals, rural health clinics, community health centers, and independent practices each maintain separate governance, separate administration, and separate financial structures. This fragmentation creates redundant overhead, prevents coordination, and precludes the cross-subsidization that keeps marginal facilities operating.\nThe distributed campus unifies these fragments under single regional governance. Rather than asking whether each facility is independently viable, the model asks whether the regional system is viable. High-volume facilities cross-subsidize low-volume but essential access points. Professionals rotate across locations, ensuring coverage without requiring each location to support full-time staff. Administrative functions consolidate, reducing overhead. Technology platforms connect all locations seamlessly.\nStructural Specifications\nDimension Specification Ownership Single regional entity (nonprofit or public authority) Governance Regional board with representation from constituent communities Facilities Network of differentiated locations from service centers to regional hospitals Services Full regional scope; services located based on volume and access needs Workforce Single employer; staff rotate across locations as assignments require Funding Unified regional budget with explicit cross-subsidization formulas Risk management Pooled across entire network; no individual facility profit/loss accountability The distributed campus abandons the fiction that each rural facility should be independently viable. Viability is a regional question, not a facility question. Some locations will always require subsidy; the question is whether the regional system generates sufficient surplus elsewhere to sustain essential access points.\nExplicit cross-subsidization formulas prevent the drift toward hub prioritization that undermines network benefit. Rather than allowing regional hospitals to accumulate surplus while rural access points starve, governance allocates resources according to access needs. The formula might weight allocation toward facilities serving frontier populations, higher-need demographics, or areas with longer travel times to alternatives.\nUnified employment enables workforce deployment that matches need rather than facility budget. Specialists rotate through service centers on scheduled visits. Primary care providers cover multiple locations. CHWs serve assigned populations regardless of which facility is nearest. This flexibility prevents the staffing shortfalls that occur when each facility must independently afford its workforce.\nStrengths and Limitations\nThe distributed campus offers scale efficiency impossible in fragmented systems. Consolidated administration, unified technology, coordinated purchasing, and pooled risk reduce costs substantially. Professional management ensures operational competence. Explicit cross-subsidization sustains access points that independent operation would close.\nLimitations center on governance distance. Regional boards governing multiple communities cannot maintain the local accountability that community-based models provide. Constituent communities may feel that their priorities are subordinated to regional optimization. Risk of hub prioritization persists despite cross-subsidization formulas; regional hospitals inevitably have more board representation and administrative presence than remote service centers.\nCorporate acquisition vulnerability threatens distributed campus sustainability. The unified regional entity presents an attractive acquisition target for health systems seeking geographic expansion. Once acquired, system priorities may override regional commitments. Communities lose local control not to democratic regional governance but to corporate headquarters.\nExisting Examples\nBassett Healthcare Network in rural New York operates as a distributed campus with a regional hospital, multiple clinics, and affiliated partners across a large geography. Avera Health in South Dakota operates similar network models. These examples demonstrate operational viability but also illustrate governance tensions when regional and local priorities conflict.\nModel 4: The Innovation Zone The innovation zone differs from other models by addressing regulatory barriers rather than ownership structure. It creates geographic areas where regulatory flexibility enables governance experiments impossible under standard rules.\nCore Concept\nMany governance innovations fail not because they are operationally impossible but because regulations prohibit them. Scope of practice laws prevent nurse practitioners from practicing independently. Facility licensing requires configurations designed for urban volume. Payment rules reimburse services rather than outcomes. Communities that want to govern health services differently cannot because regulations constrain what governance can decide.\nInnovation zones establish geographic areas where regulatory waivers enable experimentation. Within the zone, expanded scope of practice allows non-physician providers to deliver services prohibited elsewhere. Alternative facility categories permit configurations that standard licensing forbids. Payment innovation enables global budgets, direct CHW reimbursement, and value-based arrangements. Enhanced monitoring ensures accountability while regulatory flexibility enables innovation.\nStructural Specifications\nDimension Specification Geographic scope Defined rural area meeting eligibility criteria Regulatory authority State designation with federal waiver coordination Flexibility scope Scope of practice, facility licensing, payment rules, workforce certification Accountability Enhanced outcome monitoring in exchange for regulatory flexibility Duration Time-limited with renewal based on performance Ownership Compatible with any ownership model (commons, cooperative, distributed campus) Innovation zones layer onto other governance models rather than replacing them. A rural cooperative could seek innovation zone designation to expand what cooperative governance can authorize. A distributed campus could operate under innovation zone flexibility for payment and workforce rules. The zone addresses regulatory constraints that limit governance options; ownership and control structures remain separate decisions.\nThe Maryland Health Enterprise Zone Initiative provides partial precedent. Beginning in 2013, Maryland designated geographic areas where coordinated interventions aimed to improve health outcomes in underserved communities. The initiative demonstrated that zone-based approaches could produce measurable results: reduced inpatient stays, increased primary care utilization, and cost savings exceeding program costs.\nFlexibility Domains\nDomain Standard Rule Innovation Zone Flexibility NP scope Physician supervision in many states Independent practice within zone Pharmacist services Dispensing, limited counseling Prescribing for selected conditions Dental therapists Prohibited in most states Authorized and supervised within zone CHW billing Limited direct billing pathways Direct Medicaid/Medicare billing Facility categories Rigid state licensing requirements Alternative categories matching rural need AI services Uncertain liability framework Clear zone framework for AI deployment Payment models Fee-for-service default Global budgets, outcomes-based payment Strengths and Limitations\nInnovation zones enable experimentation impossible elsewhere. Communities can test governance approaches that regulations otherwise prevent. Successful innovations generate evidence that supports broader policy change. Enhanced monitoring creates accountability that pure deregulation would lack.\nLimitations include authorization complexity. Zone designation requires state action and often federal waiver coordination, creating political and administrative barriers. Two-tier system concerns arise when zone residents receive different care than non-zone residents. Time limits create uncertainty about whether investments in zone-specific capacity will be stranded if designation expires.\nModel Comparison The four models offer different tradeoffs across critical dimensions:\nCriterion Commons Cooperative Distributed Campus Innovation Zone Community control Very high High Moderate Varies by base model Scale efficiency Low Moderate High Varies by base model Formation complexity High High Moderate Very high Capital access Limited Established pathways Strong Varies by base model Regulatory pathway Uncertain Established Established Requires waiver Sustainability risk Civic capacity Member engagement Hub prioritization Authorization expiration No single model suits all circumstances. Communities with strong civic traditions and engaged populations may thrive under commons governance. Communities with cooperative experience may find agricultural cooperative models natural. Regions where facilities already exist may benefit from distributed campus consolidation. Areas where regulation specifically blocks needed innovation may require innovation zone designation.\nHybrid approaches may prove most practical. A cooperative could operate within an innovation zone, combining democratic member governance with regulatory flexibility. A distributed campus could incorporate commons principles in its community advisory structures. The models are design elements that combine rather than exclusive choices.\nVignette: Three Counties, Three Models Southeast Oklahoma, 2033\nPushmataha, Choctaw, and McCurtain Counties share geography, history, and the experience of watching healthcare options disappear. Pushmataha’s hospital closed in 2019. Choctaw’s closed in 2022. McCurtain’s survived but eliminated obstetrics, surgery, and most specialty services.\nThe counties chose different governance paths for reconstruction. How they chose reveals as much as what they chose.\nPushmataha had the Choctaw Nation. Tribal sovereignty enabled regulatory flexibility without state authorization, and gaming revenue provided capital that other counties lacked. The Nation created a health enterprise structured as a tribal corporation with commons principles: all tribal members could access services regardless of contribution, governance included elder councils alongside corporate boards, and the enterprise explicitly served surrounding non-tribal communities through inter-governmental agreements.\nThe enterprise operates three service centers across the county connected by broadband the Nation installed. CHWs who grew up in Clayton and Antlers now provide most front-line care. Physicians rotate through from McAlester on schedules the community sets. The AI companion that monitors elders speaks Choctaw.\nChoctaw County had no tribe but had cooperative tradition. Three generations had purchased electricity from Choctaw Electric Cooperative; the farmers’ cooperative had marketed cattle for decades. When healthcare advocates proposed a health cooperative, they found audiences who understood member ownership and democratic governance.\nFormation took two years. Membership reached 4,000 before the cooperative opened its first clinic. The National Cooperative Bank provided construction financing. The cooperative federation in Tulsa provided technical assistance. Today the cooperative operates a primary care clinic in Hugo, a mobile dental unit, and contracts with Pushmataha’s tribal enterprise for specialist access. Members pay $50 monthly (sliding scale to $10); patronage dividends returned $200,000 to members last year.\nMcCurtain County kept its struggling hospital but recognized that independent survival was impossible. Working with the Regional Medical Center in Texarkana, the county restructured under distributed campus governance. The Idabel hospital became a campus location within the Texarkana system, with explicit cross-subsidization guarantees written into affiliation agreements.\nThe arrangement is not perfect. McCurtain residents complain that Texarkana administrators do not understand their needs. Service decisions sometimes prioritize system efficiency over local access. But the hospital remains open, and specialists who never would have practiced in Idabel now rotate through on system schedules.\nWhat the three counties share matters more than their differences. All three rejected the premise that rural communities must accept whatever governance distant systems impose. All three fought for voice in decisions that affect their health. All three proved that alternatives exist.\nWhen healthcare researchers visit to study the “Southeast Oklahoma Natural Experiment,” they find communities that are proud of different choices. “We’re not saying our way is the only way,” the cooperative president told me. “We’re saying communities should get to choose.”\nProblem Resolution Governance models address the eleven structural problems by ensuring that transformation serves community benefit:\nProblem Governance Contribution 1. Hospital survival Enables alternatives to failing institutional models 2. Workforce flight Aligns workforce development with community need 3. Technology adoption Ensures technology serves communities rather than extracting from them 4. Broadband Prioritizes universal access over profitable segments 5. Public-private partnership Creates accountable structures for partnership 6. Aging in place Keeps elder services under community control 7. Food access Integrates food systems into comprehensive community governance 8. Behavioral health Ensures behavioral health prioritization despite lower revenue 9. Dental deserts Maintains dental services that for-profit models abandon 10. Social coordination Integrates social services under unified governance 11. Financial/legal Enables professional service integration community would otherwise lack Governance does not solve problems directly but creates conditions where solutions become possible. Without community-accountable governance, transformation investments may be captured by external interests, redirected to profitable services, or abandoned when political winds shift. With appropriate governance, communities can ensure that transformation serves their priorities and sustains over time.\nConclusion Governance determines whether rural health transformation serves communities or exploits them. Technology can enable new service models; capital can finance infrastructure; workforce can staff operations. But governance decides whose interests guide decisions, who benefits from success, and who bears accountability for failure.\nThe four models examined here offer different approaches to aligning governance with community benefit. Commons governance maximizes democratic control but requires civic capacity that not all communities possess. Cooperative governance applies proven rural structures to healthcare with established legal and financial pathways. Distributed campus governance enables scale efficiency and cross-subsidization but risks local accountability loss. Innovation zone designation creates regulatory flexibility that enables governance experimentation.\nNo model guarantees success. Commons and cooperatives can be captured by local elites. Distributed campuses can subordinate rural needs to hub priorities. Innovation zones can expire without renewal. Governance design is necessary but not sufficient; sustained community engagement, competent leadership, and adequate resources also determine outcomes.\nBut governance failure guarantees exploitation. Without community-accountable structures, rural health transformation will be designed elsewhere, implemented by others, and evaluated against metrics that may not match community priorities. The infrastructure will belong to someone else. The value created will flow elsewhere. When circumstances change, decisions about rural communities will be made without them.\nThe alternative architecture this series presents requires governance that keeps communities in control. The inverse hub needs governance that ensures virtual care serves patients rather than convenience. AI deployment needs governance that ensures companions serve elders rather than data extractors. Local workforce needs governance that ensures jobs serve career builders rather than gig platforms. Service centers need governance that ensures facilities serve access needs rather than return requirements. Sovereign investment needs governance that ensures capital serves transformation rather than connected interests.\nGovernance is not an afterthought or administrative detail. It is the mechanism through which communities determine whether transformation serves them. The models matter. The choices matter. The design matters.\nCross-References To Series 6 (Intermediaries)\n6A Hospital Associations: Network support for governance 6B FQHC Networks and PCAs: Cooperative models in practice To Series 7 (Providers)\n7A Critical Access Hospitals: What governance alternatives might replace 7B Rural Health Clinics: Facility integration under governance models To Series 8 (Community Organizations)\n8G Alternative Ownership Models: Community ownership evidence base To Series 14 (Alternative Architecture)\n14A The Inverse Hub: Governance for virtual-first delivery 14B AI as Infrastructure: Governance ensuring AI serves communities 14C The Local Workforce: Governance for local employment 14D The Service Center: Governance for facility operation 14E State Sovereign Investment: Capital for governance implementation 14G Tribal Demonstration: Sovereignty enabling governance innovation To Series 15 (Enabling Conditions)\n15A Regulatory Transformation: Regulatory changes governance requires 15E Political Economy: Coalition building for governance change To Series 16 (Futures)\n16F Community Action Guide: Governance implementation pathways Sources Commonwealth Fund. “How Regional Partnerships Bolster Rural Hospitals.” Commonwealth Fund, May 2023, commonwealthfund.org.\nHealth Affairs. “Access, Quality, And Financial Performance Of Rural Hospitals Following Health System Affiliation.” Health Affairs, vol. 39, no. 2, 2020, pp. 320-328.\nHealth Affairs. “The Maryland Health Enterprise Zone Initiative Reduced Hospital Cost And Utilization In Underserved Communities.” Health Affairs, vol. 38, no. 1, 2019, pp. 100-108.\nNational Rural Electric Cooperative Association. “America’s Electric Cooperatives.” NRECA, 2025, electric.coop.\nNPR. “Rural Hospitals Band Together Instead of Selling to Big Networks.” NPR Shots, Sept. 2025, npr.org.\nPMC. “Rural Hospital Networks: Implications for Rural Health Reform.” Health Services Research, PMC, 1994.\nRAND Corporation. “Access, Quality, and Financial Performance of Rural Hospitals Following Health System Affiliation.” RAND Health Care, 2020.\nRural Health Information Hub. “Rural Hospitals: Models and Innovations.” RHIhub, 2025, ruralhealthinfo.org.\nRural Wisconsin Health Cooperative. “RWHC Overview.” RWHC, 2025, rwhc.com.\nRHTP 14.F: Governance Models / Series 14: The Alternative Architecture / Rural Health Transformation Project / Version 1: February 2026\n",

<p>Technology and capital alone cannot transform rural health. The inverse hub model (14A) provides a delivery architecture. AI services (14B) extend professional capacity. Local workforce (14C) creates employment. Service centers (14D) establish physical presence. Sovereign investment (14E) provides patient capital. But <strong>governance determines whether transformation serves communities or extracts from them</strong>. Who makes decisions? Who captures value? Who bears accountability when things go wrong?</p>
<p>Rural communities have experienced the consequences of governance misalignment for decades. Hospital systems headquartered hundreds of miles away acquire local facilities, then close service lines that do not meet corporate return requirements. Investor-owned chains extract revenue while deferring maintenance and reducing staff. Government programs impose reporting requirements without providing resources for compliance. <strong>Communities have responsibility for their health outcomes without authority over the systems that produce them.</strong></p>
<p>Alternative architecture requires governance structures designed for rural sustainability rather than urban scale economics. This article examines four governance models that could align control, benefit, and accountability: the rural commons, the agricultural health cooperative, the distributed campus, and the innovation zone. Each offers different tradeoffs between community control, operational capacity, and scale efficiency. The analysis draws from existing examples where community governance has succeeded and from failures that illuminate what governance design must avoid.</p>
<h2 id="the-current-governance-failure">The Current Governance Failure<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-current-governance-failure">#</a></h2>
<p>Rural health governance fails along predictable patterns. Understanding these failures guides the design of alternatives.</p>
<p><strong>Health system acquisition extracts rather than invests.</strong> When regional or national health systems acquire rural hospitals, the transaction often promises capital investment and service expansion. Reality frequently delivers the opposite. A RAND Corporation analysis found that rural hospitals joining health systems experienced <strong>reduced access to care</strong> compared to independent hospitals. Affiliated hospitals reduced service lines, closed units, and eliminated programs that did not contribute to system-wide financial performance. The logic is straightforward: health systems optimize portfolios, directing capital toward facilities with higher returns. Rural hospitals rarely win that competition.</p>
<p>The problem is not malicious intent but structural incentive. System executives have fiduciary obligations to optimize system performance, not to sustain unprofitable rural facilities. When system strategy conflicts with local need, system strategy wins. Rural communities lose control when they accept acquisition, trading immediate financial relief for long-term subordination to priorities set elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Investor ownership prioritizes extraction.</strong> Private equity acquisition of healthcare facilities has increased dramatically, with predictable consequences for quality and access. Investor-owned facilities face pressure to maximize cash flow for distribution to investors, creating incentives to reduce staffing, defer maintenance, and eliminate services that generate community benefit but insufficient profit. When private equity acquires rural facilities, <strong>the ownership structure explicitly prioritizes financial return over community service.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Government programs impose without empowering.</strong> Federal and state rural health programs create funding streams with compliance requirements that consume administrative capacity without transferring meaningful authority. Critical Access Hospitals must meet federal conditions of participation regardless of whether those conditions make sense for their communities. RHTP requires states to submit applications, plans, and reports demonstrating compliance with federal priorities. Communities receive funding but not autonomy; they implement programs designed elsewhere rather than solutions they develop.</p>
<p><strong>Nonprofit governance often lacks community accountability.</strong> Many rural hospitals operate as nonprofit organizations with community benefit obligations. In theory, nonprofit status aligns governance with community interest. In practice, <strong>nonprofit boards often become self-perpetuating bodies disconnected from the communities they nominally serve</strong>. Board members may be appointed based on donor relationships, professional networks, or historical membership rather than community representation. Governance structures designed decades ago for different circumstances persist without adaptation.</p>
<p><strong>Communities have responsibility without authority.</strong> When rural hospitals close, communities bear the consequences: longer travel times for emergency care, economic disruption from job losses, reduced attractiveness for employers and residents. But communities typically have no governance role in the decisions that produce these consequences. They are stakeholders affected by decisions rather than participants making them.</p>
<h2 id="model-1-the-rural-commons">Model 1: The Rural Commons<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#model-1-the-rural-commons">#</a></h2>
<p>The rural commons adapts traditional commons governance to healthcare, treating health services as shared community resources managed collectively rather than private goods traded in markets.</p>
<p><strong>Core Concept</strong></p>
<p>Commons governance emerged historically for managing shared resources where neither private ownership nor state control produced sustainable outcomes. Fishing grounds, irrigation systems, grazing lands, and forests have been successfully governed through commons arrangements where users collectively establish rules, monitor compliance, and adapt management to changing conditions. <strong>The insight is that communities can govern shared resources effectively when governance structures align decision authority with stake in outcomes.</strong></p>
<p>Rural health meets the conditions that favor commons governance. Services are locally bounded; what happens in one community matters primarily to that community. Users are identifiable and relatively stable; rural populations have lower mobility than urban populations. Relationships are repeated; people interact with providers over years and decades. Information about quality and need flows through community networks. These conditions enable the trust and reciprocity that commons governance requires.</p>

<p>Membership creates stake. Unlike traditional nonprofit structures where community members have no formal relationship to governance, commons membership connects contribution to voice. Members pay according to ability, creating financial stake regardless of income level. Members vote on board composition and major policy decisions, creating democratic accountability.</p>
<p><strong>The commons does not employ physicians directly.</strong> Professionals are contracted through regional networks or individual arrangements, preserving professional autonomy while ensuring community control over service priorities. The commons decides what services to offer and how to allocate resources; professionals decide how to practice within those parameters.</p>
<p>Regional networks provide services that individual commons cannot achieve independently: risk pooling, professional recruitment, technology platforms, purchasing, and regulatory compliance support. <strong>Commons affiliate horizontally with peers rather than vertically with corporate systems</strong>, maintaining local control while accessing scale benefits.</p>
<p><strong>Strengths and Limitations</strong></p>
<p>Commons governance offers <strong>democratic control</strong> that no other model matches. Members set priorities, elect leadership, and hold governance accountable. Service integration across health, behavioral health, dental, and social services occurs naturally because the same community governance oversees all domains. Surplus returns to community benefit rather than external shareholders.</p>
<p>Limitations are significant. Governance complexity requires engaged membership and capable leadership; communities with low civic capacity may struggle. Risk of <strong>elite capture</strong> exists when influential community members dominate governance despite democratic structures. Formation requires substantial organizing effort and technical assistance that may not be available. The model has limited precedent in American healthcare, creating uncertainty about regulatory treatment and operational viability.</p>
<p><strong>Existing Examples</strong></p>
<p>Direct precedents in American healthcare are limited, but adjacent models provide evidence. <strong>Community health centers</strong> operate with board requirements that mandate patient majority representation, creating governance closer to commons principles than typical nonprofit structures. <strong>Rural electric cooperatives</strong> demonstrate that commons-like governance can operate successfully at significant scale for essential services; over 900 rural electric cooperatives serve 42 million Americans through member-owned structures.</p>
<h2 id="model-2-the-agricultural-health-cooperative">Model 2: The Agricultural Health Cooperative<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#model-2-the-agricultural-health-cooperative">#</a></h2>
<p>The agricultural cooperative model applies proven rural cooperative structures to healthcare, building on the cooperative tradition that already provides electricity, telecommunications, credit, and marketing services in rural America.</p>
<p><strong>Core Concept</strong></p>
<p>Rural cooperatives emerged in the early twentieth century when private markets failed to serve dispersed agricultural communities. Farmers could not individually afford electric service, access credit on reasonable terms, or market products competitively. Cooperative structures enabled collective action: <strong>farmers pooled resources, shared risk, and created enterprises they controlled democratically</strong>.</p>
<p>The Rural Electrification Administration catalyzed rural electric cooperative formation in the 1930s by providing capital and technical assistance. Within decades, cooperatives had electrified rural America where private utilities refused to invest. The same model could apply to healthcare: communities that cannot attract private investment in health services might create cooperative enterprises that they own and govern.</p>

<p>The cooperative differs from the commons primarily in formalization and business structure. Cooperatives operate as legal business entities with established corporate forms, regulatory pathways, and financing mechanisms. The <strong>National Cooperative Bank</strong> and other cooperative lenders provide capital; cooperative development organizations provide technical assistance; cooperative law is well-established.</p>
<p>Member subscription creates both financial stake and service access. Unlike insurance premiums that flow to corporate shareholders, <strong>cooperative subscriptions remain in the enterprise</strong> and return to members as patronage dividends when the cooperative generates surplus. This structure aligns member and organizational interests: members benefit when the cooperative succeeds.</p>
<p>Professional management distinguishes cooperatives from pure democratic governance. Members elect boards that set policy and hire professional managers who handle operations. This separation preserves democratic control while ensuring operational competence. Rural electric cooperatives have operated successfully for decades with this structure.</p>
<p><strong>Federation and Affiliation</strong></p>
<p>Individual cooperatives affiliate with federations that provide services impossible at single-cooperative scale:</p>

<p>Federations enable cooperatives to access scale benefits while preserving local control. <strong>The National Rural Electric Cooperative Association</strong> demonstrates this model: individual cooperatives remain independent while the national association provides services, advocacy, and coordination.</p>
<p><strong>Strengths and Limitations</strong></p>
<p>Cooperatives offer <strong>proven rural viability</strong>. The model has worked for electricity, telecommunications, credit, and marketing in rural settings for nearly a century. Regulatory and financing pathways are established. Member alignment ensures that governance serves user interests.</p>
<p>Limitations include formation complexity: creating a cooperative requires substantial organizing, legal work, and initial capitalization. Cooperative decision-making can be slow when consensus proves elusive. <strong>Capital access remains challenging</strong> despite cooperative lenders; health cooperatives have limited track record that makes lenders cautious. State cooperative law varies, creating regulatory uncertainty in some jurisdictions.</p>
<p><strong>Existing Examples</strong></p>
<p><strong>Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound</strong> operated as a consumer cooperative for decades before Permanente acquisition. <strong>HealthPartners</strong> in Minnesota maintains cooperative governance. <strong>Rural Wisconsin Health Cooperative</strong> provides network services to member hospitals through cooperative structure. These examples demonstrate that cooperative models can operate in healthcare at significant scale.</p>
<h2 id="model-3-the-distributed-campus">Model 3: The Distributed Campus<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#model-3-the-distributed-campus">#</a></h2>
<p>The distributed campus model creates unified governance across multiple locations, treating the region as a single campus with differentiated facilities rather than separate institutions competing or failing independently.</p>
<p><strong>Core Concept</strong></p>
<p>Rural areas contain multiple small facilities, each struggling for independent viability. Critical access hospitals, rural health clinics, community health centers, and independent practices each maintain separate governance, separate administration, and separate financial structures. <strong>This fragmentation creates redundant overhead, prevents coordination, and precludes the cross-subsidization that keeps marginal facilities operating.</strong></p>
<p>The distributed campus unifies these fragments under single regional governance. Rather than asking whether each facility is independently viable, the model asks whether the regional system is viable. High-volume facilities cross-subsidize low-volume but essential access points. Professionals rotate across locations, ensuring coverage without requiring each location to support full-time staff. Administrative functions consolidate, reducing overhead. Technology platforms connect all locations seamlessly.</p>

<p>The distributed campus abandons the fiction that each rural facility should be independently viable. <strong>Viability is a regional question</strong>, not a facility question. Some locations will always require subsidy; the question is whether the regional system generates sufficient surplus elsewhere to sustain essential access points.</p>
<p>Explicit cross-subsidization formulas prevent the drift toward hub prioritization that undermines network benefit. Rather than allowing regional hospitals to accumulate surplus while rural access points starve, governance allocates resources according to access needs. The formula might weight allocation toward facilities serving frontier populations, higher-need demographics, or areas with longer travel times to alternatives.</p>
<p><strong>Unified employment</strong> enables workforce deployment that matches need rather than facility budget. Specialists rotate through service centers on scheduled visits. Primary care providers cover multiple locations. CHWs serve assigned populations regardless of which facility is nearest. This flexibility prevents the staffing shortfalls that occur when each facility must independently afford its workforce.</p>
<p><strong>Strengths and Limitations</strong></p>
<p>The distributed campus offers <strong>scale efficiency</strong> impossible in fragmented systems. Consolidated administration, unified technology, coordinated purchasing, and pooled risk reduce costs substantially. Professional management ensures operational competence. Explicit cross-subsidization sustains access points that independent operation would close.</p>
<p>Limitations center on <strong>governance distance</strong>. Regional boards governing multiple communities cannot maintain the local accountability that community-based models provide. Constituent communities may feel that their priorities are subordinated to regional optimization. Risk of hub prioritization persists despite cross-subsidization formulas; regional hospitals inevitably have more board representation and administrative presence than remote service centers.</p>
<p><strong>Corporate acquisition vulnerability</strong> threatens distributed campus sustainability. The unified regional entity presents an attractive acquisition target for health systems seeking geographic expansion. Once acquired, system priorities may override regional commitments. Communities lose local control not to democratic regional governance but to corporate headquarters.</p>
<p><strong>Existing Examples</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bassett Healthcare Network</strong> in rural New York operates as a distributed campus with a regional hospital, multiple clinics, and affiliated partners across a large geography. <strong>Avera Health</strong> in South Dakota operates similar network models. These examples demonstrate operational viability but also illustrate governance tensions when regional and local priorities conflict.</p>
<h2 id="model-4-the-innovation-zone">Model 4: The Innovation Zone<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#model-4-the-innovation-zone">#</a></h2>
<p>The innovation zone differs from other models by addressing regulatory barriers rather than ownership structure. It creates geographic areas where regulatory flexibility enables governance experiments impossible under standard rules.</p>
<p><strong>Core Concept</strong></p>
<p>Many governance innovations fail not because they are operationally impossible but because regulations prohibit them. Scope of practice laws prevent nurse practitioners from practicing independently. Facility licensing requires configurations designed for urban volume. Payment rules reimburse services rather than outcomes. <strong>Communities that want to govern health services differently cannot because regulations constrain what governance can decide.</strong></p>
<p>Innovation zones establish geographic areas where regulatory waivers enable experimentation. Within the zone, expanded scope of practice allows non-physician providers to deliver services prohibited elsewhere. Alternative facility categories permit configurations that standard licensing forbids. Payment innovation enables global budgets, direct CHW reimbursement, and value-based arrangements. Enhanced monitoring ensures accountability while regulatory flexibility enables innovation.</p>

<p><strong>Innovation zones layer onto other governance models</strong> rather than replacing them. A rural cooperative could seek innovation zone designation to expand what cooperative governance can authorize. A distributed campus could operate under innovation zone flexibility for payment and workforce rules. The zone addresses regulatory constraints that limit governance options; ownership and control structures remain separate decisions.</p>
<p>The Maryland Health Enterprise Zone Initiative provides partial precedent. Beginning in 2013, Maryland designated geographic areas where coordinated interventions aimed to improve health outcomes in underserved communities. <strong>The initiative demonstrated that zone-based approaches could produce measurable results</strong>: reduced inpatient stays, increased primary care utilization, and cost savings exceeding program costs.</p>

<p><strong>No single model suits all circumstances.</strong> Communities with strong civic traditions and engaged populations may thrive under commons governance. Communities with cooperative experience may find agricultural cooperative models natural. Regions where facilities already exist may benefit from distributed campus consolidation. Areas where regulation specifically blocks needed innovation may require innovation zone designation.</p>
<p><strong>Hybrid approaches may prove most practical.</strong> A cooperative could operate within an innovation zone, combining democratic member governance with regulatory flexibility. A distributed campus could incorporate commons principles in its community advisory structures. The models are design elements that combine rather than exclusive choices.</p>
<h2 id="vignette-three-counties-three-models">Vignette: Three Counties, Three Models<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#vignette-three-counties-three-models">#</a></h2>
<p><em>Southeast Oklahoma, 2033</em></p>
<p>Pushmataha, Choctaw, and McCurtain Counties share geography, history, and the experience of watching healthcare options disappear. Pushmataha&rsquo;s hospital closed in 2019. Choctaw&rsquo;s closed in 2022. McCurtain&rsquo;s survived but eliminated obstetrics, surgery, and most specialty services.</p>
<p>The counties chose different governance paths for reconstruction. How they chose reveals as much as what they chose.</p>
<p><strong>Pushmataha</strong> had the Choctaw Nation. Tribal sovereignty enabled regulatory flexibility without state authorization, and gaming revenue provided capital that other counties lacked. The Nation created a health enterprise structured as <strong>a tribal corporation with commons principles</strong>: all tribal members could access services regardless of contribution, governance included elder councils alongside corporate boards, and the enterprise explicitly served surrounding non-tribal communities through inter-governmental agreements.</p>
<p>The enterprise operates three service centers across the county connected by broadband the Nation installed. CHWs who grew up in Clayton and Antlers now provide most front-line care. Physicians rotate through from McAlester on schedules the community sets. The AI companion that monitors elders speaks Choctaw.</p>
<p><strong>Choctaw County</strong> had no tribe but had cooperative tradition. Three generations had purchased electricity from Choctaw Electric Cooperative; the farmers&rsquo; cooperative had marketed cattle for decades. <strong>When healthcare advocates proposed a health cooperative</strong>, they found audiences who understood member ownership and democratic governance.</p>
<p>Formation took two years. Membership reached 4,000 before the cooperative opened its first clinic. The National Cooperative Bank provided construction financing. The cooperative federation in Tulsa provided technical assistance. Today the cooperative operates a primary care clinic in Hugo, a mobile dental unit, and contracts with Pushmataha&rsquo;s tribal enterprise for specialist access. Members pay $50 monthly (sliding scale to $10); patronage dividends returned $200,000 to members last year.</p>
<p><strong>McCurtain County</strong> kept its struggling hospital but recognized that independent survival was impossible. Working with the Regional Medical Center in Texarkana, <strong>the county restructured under distributed campus governance</strong>. The Idabel hospital became a campus location within the Texarkana system, with explicit cross-subsidization guarantees written into affiliation agreements.</p>
<p>The arrangement is not perfect. McCurtain residents complain that Texarkana administrators do not understand their needs. Service decisions sometimes prioritize system efficiency over local access. But the hospital remains open, and specialists who never would have practiced in Idabel now rotate through on system schedules.</p>
<p>What the three counties share matters more than their differences. <strong>All three rejected the premise that rural communities must accept whatever governance distant systems impose.</strong> All three fought for voice in decisions that affect their health. All three proved that alternatives exist.</p>
<p>When healthcare researchers visit to study the &ldquo;Southeast Oklahoma Natural Experiment,&rdquo; they find communities that are proud of different choices. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not saying our way is the only way,&rdquo; the cooperative president told me. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re saying communities should get to choose.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Governance does not solve problems directly</strong> but creates conditions where solutions become possible. Without community-accountable governance, transformation investments may be captured by external interests, redirected to profitable services, or abandoned when political winds shift. With appropriate governance, communities can ensure that transformation serves their priorities and sustains over time.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>Governance determines whether rural health transformation serves communities or exploits them. Technology can enable new service models; capital can finance infrastructure; workforce can staff operations. But governance decides whose interests guide decisions, who benefits from success, and who bears accountability for failure.</p>
<p>The four models examined here offer different approaches to aligning governance with community benefit. <strong>Commons governance</strong> maximizes democratic control but requires civic capacity that not all communities possess. <strong>Cooperative governance</strong> applies proven rural structures to healthcare with established legal and financial pathways. <strong>Distributed campus governance</strong> enables scale efficiency and cross-subsidization but risks local accountability loss. <strong>Innovation zone</strong> designation creates regulatory flexibility that enables governance experimentation.</p>
<p>No model guarantees success. Commons and cooperatives can be captured by local elites. Distributed campuses can subordinate rural needs to hub priorities. Innovation zones can expire without renewal. <strong>Governance design is necessary but not sufficient</strong>; sustained community engagement, competent leadership, and adequate resources also determine outcomes.</p>
<p>But governance failure guarantees exploitation. Without community-accountable structures, rural health transformation will be designed elsewhere, implemented by others, and evaluated against metrics that may not match community priorities. The infrastructure will belong to someone else. The value created will flow elsewhere. When circumstances change, decisions about rural communities will be made without them.</p>
<p>The alternative architecture this series presents requires governance that keeps communities in control. The inverse hub needs governance that ensures virtual care serves patients rather than convenience. AI deployment needs governance that ensures companions serve elders rather than data extractors. Local workforce needs governance that ensures jobs serve career builders rather than gig platforms. Service centers need governance that ensures facilities serve access needs rather than return requirements. Sovereign investment needs governance that ensures capital serves transformation rather than connected interests.</p>
<p><strong>Governance is not an afterthought or administrative detail.</strong> It is the mechanism through which communities determine whether transformation serves them. The models matter. The choices matter. The design matters.</p>
