  "articleBody": "Series 8 Technical Document A Rural Health Transformation Project\nPurpose and Analytical Value This framework provides systematic assessment methodology for evaluating community organization capacity to support RHTP health transformation goals. It replaces assumption-based approaches with evidence-based assessment, enabling states and healthcare systems to match partnership strategies to actual organizational capacity rather than presumed capacity.\nThe core problem this framework addresses: RHTP implementation often assumes community organizations exist and possess sufficient capacity to serve as transformation partners. Series 8 analysis reveals this assumption holds in some contexts and fails in others. States that proceed without capacity assessment risk either overwhelming fragile organizations with demands exceeding their capability or bypassing capable organizations that could contribute meaningfully to transformation.\nWhat this framework provides:\nStandardized dimensions for capacity evaluation Scoring methodology with transparent criteria Classification system linking assessment to partnership approach Organization type-specific assessment adaptations State-level aggregation for strategic planning Validation indicators for assessment accuracy What this framework does not provide:\nGuarantees that high-capacity organizations will perform well Substitutes for relationship-building and trust development Mechanisms for creating capacity where none exists Solutions for the authenticity versus professionalization tension Part I: Theoretical Foundation The Capacity Assessment Challenge Community organization capacity assessment draws from three established frameworks, each with strengths and limitations for RHTP application:\nThe Community Readiness Model (Tri-Ethnic Center for Prevention Research, Colorado State University) identifies nine stages of community readiness across six dimensions: existing community efforts, community knowledge of efforts, leadership support, community climate, knowledge about the issue, and available resources. Originally developed for substance abuse prevention, the model has been applied to obesity prevention, suicide prevention, and other health issues. Its strength lies in assessing community-level readiness rather than organizational capacity. Its limitation for RHTP purposes is that community readiness and organizational capacity are distinct constructs; a community may be ready for health transformation while lacking organizational infrastructure to implement it.\nNonprofit Capacity Assessment Tools including the Core Capacity Assessment Tool (CCAT), the Impact Capacity Assessment Tool (iCAT), and the Nonprofit Capacity Instrument focus on internal organizational dimensions: leadership, management, financial health, programmatic capacity, and adaptive capacity. These tools assess whether an organization functions effectively but do not evaluate healthcare partnership readiness or community embeddedness. An organization might score highly on internal capacity while lacking relationships, trust, or relevant experience for health transformation roles.\nHealthcare Partnership Readiness Frameworks including the HRSA Rural Health Care Collaboration Guide and various health system partnership assessments focus on healthcare-specific factors: clinical capacity, data sharing capability, regulatory compliance, and care coordination experience. These tools assess healthcare system readiness but typically assume community partners already possess baseline organizational capacity.\nThe RHTP Capacity Assessment Framework integrates elements from all three traditions while addressing their gaps. It assesses organizational stability (from nonprofit assessment tools), community embeddedness (from community readiness models), and healthcare partnership readiness (from healthcare collaboration frameworks) as interconnected dimensions that together determine transformation partnership viability.\nCapacity Dimensions The framework assesses five dimensions, each weighted equally at 20% of total score:\nDimension What It Measures Why It Matters for RHTP Organizational Stability Leadership continuity, board function, operational history Organizations lacking stability cannot sustain multi-year transformation partnerships Financial Health Revenue diversity, reserves, fiscal management Financial fragility creates risk for both organization and transformation initiative Professional Capacity Staffing, management systems, reporting capability RHTP subaward requirements demand professional administrative capacity Community Connection Trust, reach, authentic relationships, cultural legitimacy Organizations lacking community connection cannot deliver community-based transformation Healthcare Readiness Prior healthcare partnerships, relevant experience, data capability Healthcare-naive organizations face steep learning curves that delay implementation Equal weighting reflects intentional design choices. Arguments exist for weighting community connection more heavily (authenticity is irreplaceable) or weighting professional capacity more heavily (RHTP requirements are non-negotiable). Equal weighting acknowledges that deficiency in any dimension creates partnership risk and that different contexts may prioritize different dimensions based on specific transformation goals.\nCapacity Stages Building on the Community Readiness Model’s nine-stage structure, this framework uses a simplified four-category classification optimized for RHTP partnership decisions:\nCategory Score Range Transformation Readiness Recommended Partnership Approach High Capacity 80-100 Ready for significant RHTP roles Direct partnership with standard subaward expectations Moderate Capacity 60-79 Ready with appropriate support Partnership with technical assistance and modified expectations Emerging Capacity 40-59 Needs capacity building first Capacity building investment before formal partnership Low Capacity Below 40 Not ready for formal RHTP roles Alternative approaches; community engagement without organizational partnership The classification system matches assessment to action. Rather than simply ranking organizations, it guides specific partnership strategies appropriate to demonstrated capacity levels.\nPart II: Assessment Methodology Dimension 1: Organizational Stability (20%) Definition: The organization demonstrates consistent operations, effective governance, and leadership continuity sufficient to sustain multi-year transformation partnerships.\nIndicators:\nIndicator Scoring Criteria Data Sources Leadership Tenure 3+ years: 20 pts; 1-3 years: 12 pts; \u003c1 year or vacant: 4 pts Interviews, 990 filings Board Function Active governance: 20 pts; Minimal oversight: 12 pts; Dysfunctional/absent: 4 pts Board minutes, interviews Years Operating 10+ years: 20 pts; 5-10 years: 15 pts; 3-5 years: 10 pts; \u003c3 years: 5 pts Incorporation records, 990 filings Staff Continuity Low turnover: 20 pts; Moderate turnover: 12 pts; High turnover: 4 pts Interviews, staff records Operational Consistency Consistent programs: 20 pts; Some disruption: 12 pts; Frequent disruption: 4 pts Program records, interviews Dimension Score: Sum of indicator scores (max 100), weighted at 20% of total.\nRed Flags Requiring Additional Investigation:\nExecutive director position vacant or recently filled (within 6 months) Board membership falling below legal minimums Recent loss of major program or funding source Pending litigation or regulatory action Membership or service population declining significantly Dimension 2: Financial Health (20%) Definition: The organization demonstrates sufficient financial stability, management capacity, and revenue diversity to responsibly manage RHTP subaward funding.\nIndicators:\nIndicator Scoring Criteria Data Sources Revenue Diversity 4+ sources: 20 pts; 2-3 sources: 12 pts; 1 source: 4 pts 990 filings, financial statements Operating Reserves 6+ months: 20 pts; 3-6 months: 15 pts; 1-3 months: 8 pts; \u003c1 month: 2 pts Financial statements Audit Status Clean independent audit: 20 pts; Review engagement: 12 pts; Compilation only: 6 pts; None: 2 pts Audit reports Deficit History No deficits 3 years: 20 pts; 1 deficit: 12 pts; 2+ deficits: 4 pts 990 filings, financial statements Grant Management History Successful government grants: 20 pts; Foundation grants only: 12 pts; No grant history: 4 pts Grant records, references Dimension Score: Sum of indicator scores (max 100), weighted at 20% of total.\nRed Flags Requiring Additional Investigation:\nQualified or adverse audit opinion Accumulated deficit exceeding 25% of annual budget Single funder providing more than 60% of revenue History of grant funds returned or questioned costs Revenue declining more than 20% over three years Note on Small Organizations: Many effective rural community organizations operate with budgets under $100,000 and may not require independent audits under federal or state thresholds. The absence of audited financials should not automatically disqualify organizations; assessors should examine whether financial management practices are appropriate to organizational scale.\nDimension 3: Professional Capacity (20%) Definition: The organization possesses sufficient staffing, management systems, and administrative infrastructure to meet RHTP subaward reporting, documentation, and compliance requirements.\nIndicators:\nIndicator Scoring Criteria Data Sources Paid Staff Full-time ED + staff: 20 pts; Part-time paid leadership: 12 pts; Volunteer-only: 4 pts 990 filings, interviews Management Systems Formal policies/procedures: 20 pts; Informal but functional: 12 pts; Absent/ad hoc: 4 pts Policy documents, observation Reporting Capability Regular outcome reporting: 20 pts; Basic activity reporting: 12 pts; Minimal documentation: 4 pts Sample reports, references Technology Infrastructure Modern systems: 20 pts; Basic systems: 12 pts; Paper-based/minimal: 4 pts Observation, interviews Compliance Capacity Prior federal compliance: 20 pts; State compliance: 12 pts; No regulatory experience: 4 pts Grant history, references Dimension Score: Sum of indicator scores (max 100), weighted at 20% of total.\nRed Flags Requiring Additional Investigation:\nNo paid staff with management responsibility Inability to produce basic financial reports on request No written policies for personnel, fiscal management, or program operations Technology systems incompatible with electronic reporting requirements Prior compliance findings or audit exceptions The Professional Capacity Tension: Series 8 analysis identifies that professionalization requirements can destroy the community authenticity that makes community organizations valuable as transformation partners. This dimension assesses capacity to meet RHTP requirements; it does not suggest that professionalization is universally desirable. Organizations scoring low on professional capacity may still contribute to transformation through alternative roles that do not require federal subaward management.\nDimension 4: Community Connection (20%) Definition: The organization possesses authentic relationships, trust, reach, and cultural legitimacy within the communities it serves, enabling it to function as a genuine community voice rather than merely a service delivery mechanism.\nIndicators:\nIndicator Scoring Criteria Data Sources Community Trust High trust, sought out by community: 20 pts; Respected: 12 pts; Limited recognition: 4 pts Community interviews, reputation assessment Population Reach Serves significant portion: 20 pts; Moderate reach: 12 pts; Limited reach: 4 pts Service data, community assessment Cultural Competence Reflects community demographics: 20 pts; Some representation: 12 pts; Limited: 4 pts Staff/board composition, program design Relationship Authenticity Deep community roots: 20 pts; Established presence: 12 pts; Recently established: 4 pts Community interviews, organizational history Community Accountability Accountable to community served: 20 pts; Some accountability: 12 pts; External control: 4 pts Governance structure, community input mechanisms Dimension Score: Sum of indicator scores (max 100), weighted at 20% of total.\nAssessment Methodology Notes: Community connection assessment requires qualitative investigation beyond document review. Assessors should interview community members, observe organizational interactions with community, and examine whether the organization is genuinely embedded in community life or functions as an external service provider. High professional capacity combined with low community connection may indicate an organization that delivers services effectively but cannot serve as authentic community voice.\nRed Flags Requiring Additional Investigation:\nLeadership demographics significantly different from population served Community members unfamiliar with organization despite long operational history Governance structure excludes community voice Organization located outside the community it purports to serve History of community conflict or criticism Dimension 5: Healthcare Readiness (20%) Definition: The organization possesses sufficient healthcare sector experience, relevant partnerships, and data capability to contribute meaningfully to health transformation initiatives.\nIndicators:\nIndicator Scoring Criteria Data Sources Prior Healthcare Partnerships Formal healthcare collaborations: 20 pts; Informal relationships: 12 pts; None: 4 pts Partnership agreements, references Health-Related Experience Direct health programming: 20 pts; Related social services: 12 pts; Unrelated mission: 4 pts Program records, interviews Data Capability Health data collection/sharing: 20 pts; Basic client data: 12 pts; No data systems: 4 pts Data systems review Referral Network Integration Integrated in referral networks: 20 pts; Some connections: 12 pts; Isolated: 4 pts Network mapping, partner interviews HIPAA/Privacy Capacity HIPAA-compliant: 20 pts; Privacy policies but not HIPAA: 12 pts; No privacy protocols: 4 pts Policy review, systems assessment Dimension Score: Sum of indicator scores (max 100), weighted at 20% of total.\nRed Flags Requiring Additional Investigation:\nNo prior contact with healthcare organizations Mission unrelated to health, social services, or community wellbeing Resistance to data sharing or privacy requirements History of problematic healthcare partnerships Staff without relevant experience or credentials Note on Healthcare Readiness Development: Organizations with strong community connection but limited healthcare readiness may be excellent transformation partners with appropriate technical assistance and capacity building. Healthcare readiness can be developed more readily than community connection, which requires years of relationship building.\nPart III: Scoring and Classification Score Calculation Step 1: Calculate Dimension Scores\nFor each dimension, sum indicator scores (maximum 100 points per dimension).\nStep 2: Calculate Weighted Total\nMultiply each dimension score by 0.20 (20% weight) and sum:\nTotal Score = (Stability Ã— 0.20) + (Financial Ã— 0.20) + (Professional Ã— 0.20) + (Community Ã— 0.20) + (Healthcare Ã— 0.20) Step 3: Apply Classification\nTotal Score Classification Partnership Approach 80-100 High Capacity Direct partnership with standard expectations 60-79 Moderate Capacity Partnership with technical assistance 40-59 Emerging Capacity Capacity building before partnership Below 40 Low Capacity Alternative engagement approaches Score Interpretation Guidelines High Capacity (80-100): Organization demonstrates strength across all dimensions. Ready for direct RHTP subaward partnership with standard reporting and compliance expectations. May serve as anchor organization supporting smaller community partners. Should receive priority consideration for significant transformation roles.\nModerate Capacity (60-79): Organization demonstrates adequate capacity with specific areas needing support. Appropriate for partnership with technical assistance. Subaward expectations should be modified to match demonstrated capacity. Consider pairing with high-capacity organizations or providing dedicated TA resources.\nEmerging Capacity (40-59): Organization demonstrates potential but significant gaps in one or more dimensions. Requires capacity building investment before formal partnership. May participate in transformation through non-subaward roles: advisory capacity, community outreach, referral relationships. Capacity building timeline typically 12-24 months before partnership readiness.\nLow Capacity (Below 40): Organization lacks fundamental capacity for RHTP partnership roles. Alternative approaches required. May represent emerging community voice worthy of long-term investment but not appropriate for current transformation partnership. Consider community engagement strategies that do not require organizational partnership.\nDimension Score Analysis Total score classification provides overall guidance, but dimension-specific analysis reveals partnership design implications:\nPattern Implications High community connection, low professional capacity Organization offers authentic voice but cannot manage subaward. Consider advisory roles, partnership through fiscal sponsor, or capacity building investment. High professional capacity, low community connection Organization can manage programs but may lack legitimacy. Consider backend administrative roles rather than community-facing transformation work. Low healthcare readiness, high other dimensions Organization is capable partner needing healthcare-specific technical assistance. Pair with healthcare organizations for knowledge transfer. High stability, low financial health Organization sustains operations despite financial constraints. May respond well to stable funding; monitor for mission drift if funding substantially increases. Low stability, moderate other dimensions Leadership transition or organizational stress creates current partnership risk. Reassess after stabilization. Part IV: Organization Type-Specific Adaptations Assessment criteria require adaptation for different organization types examined in Series 8:\nFaith-Based Organizations (Article 8A) Adjusted Indicators:\nCommunity Connection: Weight congregation membership, community service history, interfaith relationships Organizational Stability: Account for pastoral transition patterns; assess denominational support structures Professional Capacity: Many faith-based organizations operate through volunteer leadership; assess capacity relative to typical organizational model rather than secular nonprofit standards Healthcare Readiness: Include parish nursing, Stephen Ministry, and other faith-based health ministry experience Special Considerations: Faith-based organizations may decline partnerships requiring separation of faith identity from programming. Assess whether RHTP partnership can accommodate faith expression or whether accommodation requirements exceed state flexibility.\nSocial Service Nonprofits (Article 8B) Adjusted Indicators:\nStandard assessment framework applies most directly Particular attention to volunteer versus professional capacity spectrum Assess whether current volunteer-dependent model can sustain RHTP partnership demands Special Considerations: Small social service nonprofits may score low on professional capacity while delivering effective community services. Assessment should distinguish between organizations that successfully operate at volunteer scale and those struggling with inadequate capacity.\nCivic and Volunteer Organizations (Article 8C) Adjusted Indicators:\nOrganizational Stability: Civic organizations (Rotary, Lions, volunteer fire departments) may demonstrate decades of stability without professional staffing Professional Capacity: Assess capacity relative to volunteer organizational model; do not penalize absence of paid staff if organization functions effectively without it Healthcare Readiness: Few civic organizations have direct healthcare experience; weight community health improvement activities Special Considerations: Civic organizations typically operate at small scale unsuited to significant RHTP subaward management. Appropriate roles include community mobilization, volunteer recruitment, and event coordination rather than program implementation.\nCommunity Health Workers and Promotoras Programs (Article 8D) Adjusted Indicators:\nCommunity Connection: Critical dimension; assess CHW community embeddedness, cultural match, language capacity Healthcare Readiness: Weight clinical supervision arrangements, training programs, health system integration Professional Capacity: Assess program management capacity separately from CHW professional credentials Special Considerations: CHW programs face inherent tension between healthcare system requirements and community authenticity. Assessment should evaluate whether program preserves community voice within professional structures.\nCommunity Development Organizations (Article 8E) Adjusted Indicators:\nFinancial Health: Weight diversity of funding sources; community development organizations with single-funder dependence face sustainability risk Healthcare Readiness: Assess SDOH experience, housing/food/transportation programming, social needs screening capacity Community Connection: Evaluate whether community development mission maintains community focus or has shifted toward funder priorities Special Considerations: Community development organizations may possess strong SDOH capacity without direct healthcare experience. Assess potential for health integration rather than current health programming.\nAdvocacy and Mutual Aid Organizations (Article 8F) Adjusted Indicators:\nOrganizational Stability: Mutual aid organizations may intentionally reject formal structures; assess whether informality reflects organizational philosophy or capacity limitation Professional Capacity: Advocacy organizations may prioritize independence over professionalization; do not penalize organizations whose capacity choices reflect mission-driven decisions Community Connection: Weight authentic community mobilization capacity Special Considerations: Advocacy and mutual aid organizations often prioritize independence over integration. Formal RHTP partnership may be inappropriate; consider whether alternative engagement preserves organizational mission while contributing to transformation goals.\nAlternative Ownership Models (Article 8G) Adjusted Indicators:\nOrganizational Stability: Assess cooperative governance function, member engagement, ownership structure effectiveness Financial Health: Evaluate capital access, member equity, revenue sustainability Community Connection: Weight member demographics, community ownership breadth Special Considerations: Alternative ownership models (cooperatives, community land trusts, CDFIs) remain unproven at scale for healthcare transformation. Assessment should acknowledge limited track record while evaluating organizational fundamentals.\nTribal Organizations (Article 8H) Adjusted Indicators:\nOrganizational Stability: Assess within tribal governance context; tribal government transitions may follow different patterns than nonprofit board transitions Community Connection: Tribal organizations serving enrolled members have inherent community connection; assess service quality and reach Healthcare Readiness: Weight IHS relationship, 638 contract experience, tribal health program history Special Considerations: Tribal sovereignty requires assessment approaches that respect governmental status. Standard nonprofit assessment frameworks may not apply; consultation with tribal leadership is essential. States should not impose assessment on tribal organizations but may offer voluntary participation.\nImmigrant and Farmworker Organizations (Article 8I) Adjusted Indicators:\nCommunity Connection: Critical dimension; assess trust within immigrant and farmworker communities, often characterized by fear of institutions Organizational Stability: Political environment creates instability independent of organizational capacity Healthcare Readiness: Weight experience with Migrant Health Centers, Community Health Centers serving immigrant populations Special Considerations: Organizations serving undocumented populations face constraints unrelated to organizational capacity. Assessment should distinguish between capacity limitations and political context limitations.\nSchools and Youth Organizations (Article 8J) Adjusted Indicators:\nOrganizational Stability: School districts possess inherent stability; assess administrative capacity for non-educational programming Professional Capacity: Schools have professional infrastructure but may lack health program management experience Healthcare Readiness: Weight school-based health center experience, school nursing, health education programming Special Considerations: School-based partnerships require navigating educational bureaucracy, academic calendar constraints, and student/family consent requirements. Assess administrative willingness and capacity for health partnerships specifically.\nPart V: State-Level Aggregation County-Level Capacity Mapping States should assess community organization capacity at county level to inform geographic strategy:\nCounty Organizations Assessed High % Moderate % Emerging % Low % Overall Classification [County A] [N] [%] [%] [%] [%] [Classification] [County B] [N] [%] [%] [%] [%] [Classification] County Classification Criteria:\nClassification Criteria Recommended State Approach High Community Capacity 2+ high-capacity organizations, 40%+ moderate or above Direct community partnership strategy Moderate Community Capacity At least 1 high-capacity organization, 25%+ moderate or above Mixed strategy with targeted TA Emerging Community Capacity Majority emerging capacity, few high/moderate Capacity building emphasis before partnership Low Community Capacity Majority low capacity, minimal moderate/high Healthcare-led with community input; alternative approaches Statewide Capacity Summary Aggregate county data provides statewide picture:\nStatewide Community Organization Capacity Assessment\rTotal Counties Assessed: ___\rTotal Organizations Assessed: ___\rCounty Distribution:\r- High Community Capacity Counties: ___% - Moderate Community Capacity Counties: ___%\r- Emerging Community Capacity Counties: ___%\r- Low Community Capacity Counties: ___%\rOrganization Distribution:\r- High Capacity Organizations: ___%\r- Moderate Capacity Organizations: ___%\r- Emerging Capacity Organizations: ___%\r- Low Capacity Organizations: ___%\rPrimary Capacity Gaps Identified:\r1. _______________\r2. _______________\r3. _______________\rRecommended State Strategy:\r_______________ Strategic Implications by State Capacity Profile State Profile Recommended RHTP Strategy Majority high/moderate capacity Ambitious community partnership strategy; significant subawards to community organizations; community voice in governance Mixed capacity with geographic variation Differentiated strategy by region; direct partnership where capacity exists; healthcare-led approaches in low-capacity areas Majority emerging capacity Capacity building investment as transformation prerequisite; phased approach with community partnership expanding as capacity develops Majority low capacity Healthcare system-led transformation with community input mechanisms; long-term capacity building investment; realistic expectations about community organization roles Part VI: Assessment Process Assessment Team Composition Effective capacity assessment requires diverse perspectives:\nRole Contribution Risk if Absent Healthcare system representative Healthcare readiness evaluation; partnership viability assessment Overestimation of healthcare naÃ¯ve organizations Community development professional Community connection evaluation; organizational dynamics understanding Undervaluation of authentic but informal organizations Nonprofit management expert Financial and professional capacity evaluation Inappropriate expectations for small/volunteer organizations Community member Trust and reputation validation; authenticity assessment Acceptance of organizations lacking genuine community connection Data Collection Process Phase 1: Document Review (1-2 weeks)\nCollect and analyze:\nIRS Form 990 filings (3 years minimum) Financial statements and audit reports Strategic plans and annual reports Board meeting minutes Program documentation Prior grant performance reports Phase 2: Organizational Interviews (1-2 weeks)\nInterview organizational leadership addressing:\nOrganizational history and mission evolution Staffing and governance structure Financial management practices Program design and outcomes Community relationships Healthcare partnerships and experience Capacity development priorities Phase 3: Community Validation (2-3 weeks)\nVerify community connection through:\nInterviews with community members served Interviews with partner organizations Observation of organizational interactions with community Review of community perception data if available Assessment of community accountability mechanisms Phase 4: Scoring and Classification (1 week)\nComplete scoring rubric for each dimension Calculate weighted total score Apply classification Identify dimension-specific strengths and gaps Develop partnership recommendations Assessment Timeline Comprehensive assessment requires 4-6 weeks per organization for thorough evaluation. Rapid assessment (2-3 weeks) is possible for organizations with strong documentation and accessible leadership but sacrifices depth on community connection dimension.\nFor statewide assessment, consider:\nPhased approach: Assess priority counties first; expand based on implementation timeline Sampling strategy: Assess representative organizations by type rather than comprehensive inventory Partner involvement: Engage State Offices of Rural Health, community foundations, and other intermediaries with existing organizational knowledge Assessment Validation Capacity assessment should be validated against outcomes:\nValidation Indicator Data Source Interpretation Partnership success rate Program performance data High-capacity organizations should show higher partnership success Technical assistance utilization TA provider records Moderate-capacity organizations should utilize TA appropriately Capacity building outcomes Pre/post assessment comparison Emerging-capacity organizations with investment should show improvement Assessment accuracy Staff and partner feedback Assessment should align with organizational self-perception and partner experience Recalibrate assessment criteria if validation indicates systematic over- or under-estimation of particular organization types or dimensions.\nPart VII: Application Guidance For State RHTP Lead Agencies Before soliciting community organization partnerships:\nConduct statewide or regional capacity assessment Map capacity geography to identify partnership-ready areas Design differentiated strategies based on capacity distribution Allocate capacity building resources to emerging-capacity areas Develop alternative approaches for low-capacity areas When selecting community organization subawardees:\nRequire capacity assessment as eligibility threshold Match subaward size and expectations to demonstrated capacity Provide technical assistance commensurate with capacity gaps Monitor partnership performance against capacity predictions Adjust future assessments based on validation data When capacity assessment reveals limited community infrastructure:\nAcknowledge limitations honestly rather than forcing inappropriate partnerships Pursue healthcare system-led approaches with authentic community input mechanisms Invest in long-term capacity building separate from immediate transformation goals Consider regional approaches that leverage capacity in adjacent areas For Healthcare Systems Seeking Community Partners Before initiating community partnerships:\nRequest or conduct capacity assessment of potential partners Match partnership expectations to demonstrated capacity Allocate resources for technical assistance and capacity support Distinguish between organizations valuable for authentic voice versus program implementation When partnering with moderate-capacity organizations:\nProvide dedicated technical assistance Modify reporting expectations to match capacity Build partnership infrastructure gradually Avoid overwhelming organizations with scope exceeding capacity When no high-capacity community partners exist:\nPursue healthcare-led approaches rather than forcing inadequate partnerships Create authentic community input mechanisms separate from organizational partnership Invest in capacity building as long-term strategy Consider whether community engagement goals can be achieved without organizational intermediaries For Community Organizations For self-assessment purposes:\nComplete capacity assessment honestly, including limitations Identify dimension-specific gaps and improvement priorities Seek roles matched to demonstrated capacity Request technical assistance for identified gaps Build capacity incrementally rather than overcommitting When considering RHTP partnership:\nAssess whether subaward expectations match organizational capacity Negotiate modifications if expectations exceed current capacity Request technical assistance for specific gaps Protect organizational identity and community mission Decline partnerships that would compromise organizational sustainability Part VIII: Limitations and Appropriate Use What This Framework Can Do Provide standardized methodology for capacity evaluation Enable comparison across organizations and contexts Guide partnership strategy based on demonstrated capacity Identify specific capacity gaps requiring technical assistance Support geographic mapping of community infrastructure What This Framework Cannot Do Create capacity where none exists. Assessment identifies limitations; it does not solve them. Low-capacity areas require long-term investment exceeding RHTP timelines.\nCapture authenticity fully. Community connection dimension attempts to assess authenticity, but genuine community trust resists quantification. High scores do not guarantee authentic relationships; low scores may miss organizations with deep but narrow community connections.\nPredict partnership success. Capacity is necessary but not sufficient for effective partnership. Leadership chemistry, mission alignment, and external factors influence outcomes beyond what assessment can measure.\nResolve the professionalization tension. Assessment documents capacity gaps but does not resolve whether addressing those gaps through professionalization would destroy the community authenticity that makes organizations valuable.\nSubstitute for relationship building. Assessment informs partnership decisions but does not replace the trust-building process required for effective collaboration.\nAppropriate Use Use this framework to:\nInform partnership strategy and expectations Allocate technical assistance resources Design differentiated approaches based on capacity geography Identify capacity building priorities Evaluate partnership readiness Do not use this framework to:\nExclude organizations from all RHTP involvement Justify predetermined partnership decisions Replace community input in partnership design Avoid engaging communities with limited organizational infrastructure Substitute quantified scores for relationship-based partnership development Sources Bridgespan Group. “Nonprofits in Rural America: Overcoming the Resource Gap.” Bridgespan, 2010. https://www.bridgespan.org/insights/nonprofits-in-rural-america-overcoming-the-resourc.\nEdwards, Ruth W., et al. “Community Readiness: Research to Practice.” Journal of Community Psychology, vol. 28, no. 3, 2000, pp. 291-307.\nHeadwaters Economics. “A Rural Capacity Map.” Headwaters Economics, 2025. https://headwaterseconomics.org/economic-development/equity/rural-capacity-map/.\nHealth Resources and Services Administration. “A Guide for Rural Health Care Collaboration and Coordination.” HRSA, August 2019. https://www.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/hrsa/rural-health/resources/hrsa-rural-collaboration-guide.pdf.\nHewlett Foundation. “Assessing Nonprofit Capacity: A Guide to Tools.” William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, August 2018. https://hewlett.org/assessing-nonprofit-capacity-guide-tools/.\nNational Council of Nonprofits. “Organizational Self-Assessments.” National Council of Nonprofits, 2024. https://www.councilofnonprofits.org/running-nonprofit/governance-leadership/organizational-self-assessments.\nNational Rural Health Resource Center. “Collaboration Resources.” Rural Health Resource Center, 2024. https://www.ruralcenter.org/resources/toolkits/collaboration.\nNetwork for Nonprofit and Social Impact. “Nonprofit Capacity Instrument.” Northwestern University, 2022. https://nnsi.northwestern.edu/nonprofit-capacity-instrument/.\nNORC at the University of Chicago. “Exploring Strategies to Improve Health and Equity in Rural Communities.” NORC, February 2020. https://www.norc.org/content/dam/norc-org/pdfs/Rural%20Assets%20Final%20Report%20Feb%2018.pdf.\nPlested, Barbara A., et al. “Community Readiness for Community Change.” Tri-Ethnic Center for Prevention Research, Colorado State University, 2015. https://tec.colostate.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/CR_Handbook_8-3-15.pdf.\nRural Health Information Hub. “Community Readiness and Engagement.” Rural Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Toolkit, 2024. https://www.ruralhealthinfo.org/toolkits/health-promotion/4/community-readiness-engagement.\nSliwa, Sarah, et al. “Using the Community Readiness Model to Select Communities for a Community-Wide Obesity Prevention Intervention.” Preventing Chronic Disease, vol. 8, no. 6, 2011, A150.\nTCC Group. “Core Capacity Assessment Tool (CCAT).” TCC Group, 2024. https://www.tccgrp.com/resource/ccat/.\nTexas Nonprofit Strong. “Built for Texas Reports.” Texas Nonprofit Strong, 2024. https://txnonprofits.org/built-texas-reports.\nUrban Institute. “In Search of ‘Good’ Rural Data: Measuring Rural Prosperity.” Urban Institute, 2020. https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/102134/in-search-of-good-rural-data.pdf.\nWalter, Vanessa. “Assessing Capacity in Rural Nonprofits.” Administrative Sciences, vol. 13, no. 9, 2023, 197.\nCross-References Series 8 Articles: Assessment framework operationalizes capacity analysis from Articles 8A-8J Article 8.Synthesis: Framework supports recommendation for “assessment, not assumption” approach Series 5 (State Agencies): State lead agencies responsible for conducting or coordinating capacity assessment Series 6 (Intermediary Organizations): Intermediaries may assist with capacity assessment and technical assistance delivery Technical Document 4-TD-A (Evidence Rating Framework): Capacity assessment validation aligns with evidence standards RHTP Series 8 Technical Document A Rural Health Transformation Project Version 1: January 2026\n",

<h2 id="purpose-and-analytical-value">Purpose and Analytical Value<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#purpose-and-analytical-value">#</a></h2>
<p>This framework provides <strong>systematic assessment methodology</strong> for evaluating community organization capacity to support RHTP health transformation goals. It replaces assumption-based approaches with evidence-based assessment, enabling states and healthcare systems to match partnership strategies to actual organizational capacity rather than presumed capacity.</p>
<p><strong>The core problem this framework addresses:</strong> RHTP implementation often assumes community organizations exist and possess sufficient capacity to serve as transformation partners. Series 8 analysis reveals this assumption holds in some contexts and fails in others. States that proceed without capacity assessment risk either <strong>overwhelming fragile organizations</strong> with demands exceeding their capability or <strong>bypassing capable organizations</strong> that could contribute meaningfully to transformation.</p>
<p><strong>What this framework provides:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Standardized dimensions for capacity evaluation</li>
<li>Scoring methodology with transparent criteria</li>
<li>Classification system linking assessment to partnership approach</li>
<li>Organization type-specific assessment adaptations</li>
<li>State-level aggregation for strategic planning</li>
<li>Validation indicators for assessment accuracy</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What this framework does not provide:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Guarantees that high-capacity organizations will perform well</li>
<li>Substitutes for relationship-building and trust development</li>
<li>Mechanisms for creating capacity where none exists</li>
<li>Solutions for the authenticity versus professionalization tension</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-capacity-assessment-challenge">The Capacity Assessment Challenge<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-capacity-assessment-challenge">#</a></h3>
<p>Community organization capacity assessment draws from three established frameworks, each with strengths and limitations for RHTP application:</p>
<p><strong>The Community Readiness Model</strong> (Tri-Ethnic Center for Prevention Research, Colorado State University) identifies nine stages of community readiness across six dimensions: existing community efforts, community knowledge of efforts, leadership support, community climate, knowledge about the issue, and available resources. Originally developed for substance abuse prevention, the model has been applied to obesity prevention, suicide prevention, and other health issues. Its strength lies in <strong>assessing community-level readiness</strong> rather than organizational capacity. Its limitation for RHTP purposes is that community readiness and organizational capacity are distinct constructs; a community may be ready for health transformation while lacking organizational infrastructure to implement it.</p>
<p><strong>Nonprofit Capacity Assessment Tools</strong> including the Core Capacity Assessment Tool (CCAT), the Impact Capacity Assessment Tool (iCAT), and the Nonprofit Capacity Instrument focus on internal organizational dimensions: leadership, management, financial health, programmatic capacity, and adaptive capacity. These tools assess whether an organization functions effectively but <strong>do not evaluate healthcare partnership readiness</strong> or community embeddedness. An organization might score highly on internal capacity while lacking relationships, trust, or relevant experience for health transformation roles.</p>
<p><strong>Healthcare Partnership Readiness Frameworks</strong> including the HRSA Rural Health Care Collaboration Guide and various health system partnership assessments focus on healthcare-specific factors: clinical capacity, data sharing capability, regulatory compliance, and care coordination experience. These tools assess <strong>healthcare system readiness</strong> but typically assume community partners already possess baseline organizational capacity.</p>
<p><strong>The RHTP Capacity Assessment Framework integrates elements from all three traditions</strong> while addressing their gaps. It assesses organizational stability (from nonprofit assessment tools), community embeddedness (from community readiness models), and healthcare partnership readiness (from healthcare collaboration frameworks) as interconnected dimensions that together determine transformation partnership viability.</p>
<h3 id="capacity-dimensions">Capacity Dimensions<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#capacity-dimensions">#</a></h3>
<p>The framework assesses five dimensions, each weighted equally at 20% of total score:</p>
<table>
  <thead>
      <tr>
          <th>Dimension</th>
          <th>What It Measures</th>
          <th>Why It Matters for RHTP</th>
      </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
      <tr>
          <td><strong>Organizational Stability</strong></td>
          <td>Leadership continuity, board function, operational history</td>
          <td>Organizations lacking stability cannot sustain multi-year transformation partnerships</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td><strong>Financial Health</strong></td>
          <td>Revenue diversity, reserves, fiscal management</td>
          <td>Financial fragility creates risk for both organization and transformation initiative</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td><strong>Professional Capacity</strong></td>
          <td>Staffing, management systems, reporting capability</td>
          <td>RHTP subaward requirements demand professional administrative capacity</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td><strong>Community Connection</strong></td>
          <td>Trust, reach, authentic relationships, cultural legitimacy</td>
          <td>Organizations lacking community connection cannot deliver community-based transformation</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td><strong>Healthcare Readiness</strong></td>
          <td>Prior healthcare partnerships, relevant experience, data capability</td>
          <td>Healthcare-naive organizations face steep learning curves that delay implementation</td>
      </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Equal weighting reflects intentional design choices.</strong> Arguments exist for weighting community connection more heavily (authenticity is irreplaceable) or weighting professional capacity more heavily (RHTP requirements are non-negotiable). Equal weighting acknowledges that <strong>deficiency in any dimension creates partnership risk</strong> and that different contexts may prioritize different dimensions based on specific transformation goals.</p>
<h3 id="capacity-stages">Capacity Stages<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#capacity-stages">#</a></h3>
<p>Building on the Community Readiness Model&rsquo;s nine-stage structure, this framework uses a simplified four-category classification optimized for RHTP partnership decisions:</p>

      <tr>
          <td><strong>High Capacity</strong></td>
          <td>80-100</td>
          <td>Ready for significant RHTP roles</td>
          <td>Direct partnership with standard subaward expectations</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td><strong>Moderate Capacity</strong></td>
          <td>60-79</td>
          <td>Ready with appropriate support</td>
          <td>Partnership with technical assistance and modified expectations</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td><strong>Emerging Capacity</strong></td>
          <td>40-59</td>
          <td>Needs capacity building first</td>
          <td>Capacity building investment before formal partnership</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td><strong>Low Capacity</strong></td>
          <td>Below 40</td>
          <td>Not ready for formal RHTP roles</td>
          <td>Alternative approaches; community engagement without organizational partnership</td>
      </tr>
  </tbody>

<p><strong>The classification system matches assessment to action.</strong> Rather than simply ranking organizations, it guides specific partnership strategies appropriate to demonstrated capacity levels.</p>

<p><strong>Note on Small Organizations:</strong> Many effective rural community organizations operate with budgets under $100,000 and may not require independent audits under federal or state thresholds. The absence of audited financials should not automatically disqualify organizations; assessors should examine whether financial management practices are appropriate to organizational scale.</p>

<p><strong>The Professional Capacity Tension:</strong> Series 8 analysis identifies that <strong>professionalization requirements can destroy the community authenticity</strong> that makes community organizations valuable as transformation partners. This dimension assesses capacity to meet RHTP requirements; it does not suggest that professionalization is universally desirable. Organizations scoring low on professional capacity may still contribute to transformation through alternative roles that do not require federal subaward management.</p>

<p><strong>Assessment Methodology Notes:</strong> Community connection assessment requires <strong>qualitative investigation beyond document review</strong>. Assessors should interview community members, observe organizational interactions with community, and examine whether the organization is genuinely embedded in community life or functions as an external service provider. High professional capacity combined with low community connection may indicate an organization that delivers services effectively but cannot serve as authentic community voice.</p>

<p><strong>High Capacity (80-100):</strong> Organization demonstrates strength across all dimensions. <strong>Ready for direct RHTP subaward partnership</strong> with standard reporting and compliance expectations. May serve as anchor organization supporting smaller community partners. Should receive priority consideration for significant transformation roles.</p>
<p><strong>Moderate Capacity (60-79):</strong> Organization demonstrates adequate capacity with specific areas needing support. <strong>Appropriate for partnership with technical assistance.</strong> Subaward expectations should be modified to match demonstrated capacity. Consider pairing with high-capacity organizations or providing dedicated TA resources.</p>
<p><strong>Emerging Capacity (40-59):</strong> Organization demonstrates potential but significant gaps in one or more dimensions. <strong>Requires capacity building investment before formal partnership.</strong> May participate in transformation through non-subaward roles: advisory capacity, community outreach, referral relationships. Capacity building timeline typically 12-24 months before partnership readiness.</p>
<p><strong>Low Capacity (Below 40):</strong> Organization lacks fundamental capacity for RHTP partnership roles. <strong>Alternative approaches required.</strong> May represent emerging community voice worthy of long-term investment but not appropriate for current transformation partnership. Consider community engagement strategies that do not require organizational partnership.</p>

<h3 id="faith-based-organizations-article-8a">Faith-Based Organizations (Article 8A)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#faith-based-organizations-article-8a">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Adjusted Indicators:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Community Connection:</strong> Weight congregation membership, community service history, interfaith relationships</li>
<li><strong>Organizational Stability:</strong> Account for pastoral transition patterns; assess denominational support structures</li>
<li><strong>Professional Capacity:</strong> Many faith-based organizations operate through volunteer leadership; assess capacity relative to typical organizational model rather than secular nonprofit standards</li>
<li><strong>Healthcare Readiness:</strong> Include parish nursing, Stephen Ministry, and other faith-based health ministry experience</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Special Considerations:</strong> Faith-based organizations may decline partnerships requiring separation of faith identity from programming. Assess whether RHTP partnership can accommodate faith expression or whether accommodation requirements exceed state flexibility.</p>
<h3 id="social-service-nonprofits-article-8b">Social Service Nonprofits (Article 8B)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#social-service-nonprofits-article-8b">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Adjusted Indicators:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Standard assessment framework applies most directly</li>
<li>Particular attention to <strong>volunteer versus professional capacity</strong> spectrum</li>
<li>Assess whether current volunteer-dependent model can sustain RHTP partnership demands</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Special Considerations:</strong> Small social service nonprofits may score low on professional capacity while delivering effective community services. Assessment should distinguish between organizations that successfully operate at volunteer scale and those struggling with inadequate capacity.</p>
<h3 id="civic-and-volunteer-organizations-article-8c">Civic and Volunteer Organizations (Article 8C)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#civic-and-volunteer-organizations-article-8c">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Adjusted Indicators:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Organizational Stability:</strong> Civic organizations (Rotary, Lions, volunteer fire departments) may demonstrate decades of stability without professional staffing</li>
<li><strong>Professional Capacity:</strong> Assess capacity relative to volunteer organizational model; do not penalize absence of paid staff if organization functions effectively without it</li>
<li><strong>Healthcare Readiness:</strong> Few civic organizations have direct healthcare experience; weight community health improvement activities</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Special Considerations:</strong> Civic organizations typically operate at small scale unsuited to significant RHTP subaward management. Appropriate roles include community mobilization, volunteer recruitment, and event coordination rather than program implementation.</p>

<li><strong>Healthcare Readiness:</strong> Weight clinical supervision arrangements, training programs, health system integration</li>
<li><strong>Professional Capacity:</strong> Assess program management capacity separately from CHW professional credentials</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Special Considerations:</strong> CHW programs face inherent tension between healthcare system requirements and community authenticity. Assessment should evaluate whether program preserves community voice within professional structures.</p>

<p><strong>Adjusted Indicators:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Organizational Stability:</strong> Mutual aid organizations may intentionally reject formal structures; assess whether informality reflects organizational philosophy or capacity limitation</li>
<li><strong>Professional Capacity:</strong> Advocacy organizations may prioritize independence over professionalization; do not penalize organizations whose capacity choices reflect mission-driven decisions</li>
<li><strong>Community Connection:</strong> Weight authentic community mobilization capacity</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Special Considerations:</strong> Advocacy and mutual aid organizations often prioritize independence over integration. Formal RHTP partnership may be inappropriate; consider whether alternative engagement preserves organizational mission while contributing to transformation goals.</p>

<li><strong>Financial Health:</strong> Evaluate capital access, member equity, revenue sustainability</li>
<li><strong>Community Connection:</strong> Weight member demographics, community ownership breadth</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Special Considerations:</strong> Alternative ownership models (cooperatives, community land trusts, CDFIs) remain unproven at scale for healthcare transformation. Assessment should acknowledge limited track record while evaluating organizational fundamentals.</p>
<h3 id="tribal-organizations-article-8h">Tribal Organizations (Article 8H)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#tribal-organizations-article-8h">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Adjusted Indicators:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Organizational Stability:</strong> Assess within tribal governance context; tribal government transitions may follow different patterns than nonprofit board transitions</li>
<li><strong>Community Connection:</strong> Tribal organizations serving enrolled members have inherent community connection; assess service quality and reach</li>
<li><strong>Healthcare Readiness:</strong> Weight IHS relationship, 638 contract experience, tribal health program history</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Special Considerations:</strong> Tribal sovereignty requires assessment approaches that respect governmental status. Standard nonprofit assessment frameworks may not apply; consultation with tribal leadership is essential. States should not impose assessment on tribal organizations but may offer voluntary participation.</p>

<p>Comprehensive assessment requires <strong>4-6 weeks per organization</strong> for thorough evaluation. Rapid assessment (2-3 weeks) is possible for organizations with strong documentation and accessible leadership but sacrifices depth on community connection dimension.</p>
<p>For statewide assessment, consider:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Phased approach:</strong> Assess priority counties first; expand based on implementation timeline</li>
<li><strong>Sampling strategy:</strong> Assess representative organizations by type rather than comprehensive inventory</li>
<li><strong>Partner involvement:</strong> Engage State Offices of Rural Health, community foundations, and other intermediaries with existing organizational knowledge</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="assessment-validation">Assessment Validation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#assessment-validation">#</a></h3>
<p>Capacity assessment should be validated against outcomes:</p>

<h3 id="what-this-framework-cannot-do">What This Framework Cannot Do<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-this-framework-cannot-do">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Create capacity where none exists.</strong> Assessment identifies limitations; it does not solve them. Low-capacity areas require long-term investment exceeding RHTP timelines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Capture authenticity fully.</strong> Community connection dimension attempts to assess authenticity, but genuine community trust resists quantification. High scores do not guarantee authentic relationships; low scores may miss organizations with deep but narrow community connections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Predict partnership success.</strong> Capacity is necessary but not sufficient for effective partnership. Leadership chemistry, mission alignment, and external factors influence outcomes beyond what assessment can measure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Resolve the professionalization tension.</strong> Assessment documents capacity gaps but does not resolve whether addressing those gaps through professionalization would destroy the community authenticity that makes organizations valuable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Substitute for relationship building.</strong> Assessment informs partnership decisions but does not replace the trust-building process required for effective collaboration.</p>
