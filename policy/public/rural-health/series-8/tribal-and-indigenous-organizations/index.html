  "articleBody": "Tribal nations are sovereign governments. This is constitutional reality, not policy perspective. The federal government has government-to-government relationships with 574 federally recognized tribes, relationships predating the United States itself. When RHTP requires states to consult with tribal affairs offices during transformation planning, it acknowledges a fundamental reality: tribal health constitutes a parallel system with its own funding streams, delivery structures, governance mechanisms, and legal framework.\nThe tension between tribal sovereignty and federal program requirements shapes every aspect of tribal health organization participation in transformation. Sovereignty means tribes have the right to determine their own approaches to health and social welfare. Federal programs have requirements: reporting, accountability, performance metrics, standardized implementation. When sovereignty and requirements conflict, which prevails?\nThis article examines tribal and indigenous community organizations beyond the formal tribal health system, including Native nonprofits, urban Indian organizations, and community-based initiatives that serve American Indian and Alaska Native populations. These organizations navigate the same sovereignty tensions while often operating outside direct tribal government control. Understanding their capacity and constraints matters for RHTP implementation in states with significant Native populations.\nThe Sovereignty Framework The federal trust responsibility for tribal health emerged from treaties, statutes, and Supreme Court precedent establishing the United States government’s obligation to provide healthcare services to American Indians and Alaska Natives. This obligation does not flow through states. It flows directly from the federal government to tribal nations.\n574 federally recognized tribes hold sovereignty status. Each tribe has distinct governance, health priorities, and relationships with federal and state governments. Generalizing about tribal health organizations risks ignoring this diversity, but certain structural features are common.\nSelf-determination is the operating policy framework. The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975 enables tribes to assume operation of programs that the Indian Health Service would otherwise provide directly. As of 2024, 526 of 574 tribes (92%) had self-determination contracts, and 295 tribes (51%) had self-governance compacts. Tribes administer over 60% of the IHS budget through these mechanisms.\nSelf-determination has produced both innovative programs and significant challenges:\nInnovative outcomes. Tribes operating their own health programs have developed culturally-responsive services that IHS direct provision could not. Some tribal health systems outperform regional averages on key measures. The flexibility of self-governance compacts has enabled integrated approaches combining healthcare, behavioral health, and social services.\nCapacity challenges. Assuming federal program operation requires administrative infrastructure, financial management systems, human resources functions, and clinical leadership that some tribes possess and others must build. Not all tribes have benefited equally from self-determination.\n“Termination by appropriation” concerns. Some tribes worry that if they assume all service delivery responsibility, the federal government retains only funding obligations it can more easily reduce or eliminate. Federal trust responsibility remains regardless of service delivery arrangement, but funding levels remain subject to congressional appropriation.\nTribal Community Organizations Beyond Healthcare Tribal nations have community organizations serving functions beyond formal health services. These organizations represent potential partners for RHTP implementation, if partnership can respect sovereignty while meeting program requirements.\nTribal colleges and universities. Thirty-five tribally controlled colleges and universities serve approximately 30,000 students. These institutions often operate community health programs, train healthcare workers, and conduct health research relevant to tribal communities. Several tribal colleges have nursing or allied health programs that could support workforce development.\nTribal housing authorities. Housing affects health. Tribal housing authorities operate approximately 78,000 housing units serving tribal members. Housing conditions, including water and sanitation infrastructure, directly affect health outcomes. IHS sanitation facilities construction programs work with tribal housing authorities on basic infrastructure.\nTribal community health representative (CHR) programs. Community Health Representatives are paraprofessional community members who provide health education, outreach, and basic services in tribal communities. The CHR program dates to 1968 and represents one of the earliest community health worker models in the United States. Approximately 1,600 CHRs serve tribal communities nationally.\nTribal Head Start and early childhood programs. American Indian and Alaska Native Head Start programs serve young children and families, with health components including screenings, health education, and connection to services.\nTribal elder programs. Tribal programs serving elders often provide health-related services including nutrition, transportation, and caregiver support. Elder care has particular cultural significance in many tribal communities.\nTribal behavioral health programs. Tribal communities face disproportionate behavioral health burdens including suicide rates among the highest of any population group. Tribal behavioral health programs often integrate traditional healing practices with clinical services.\nOrganization Type Estimated Count Primary Health Role RHTP Relevance Tribal colleges 35 Workforce training, health education High for workforce development CHR programs ~1,600 CHRs Community outreach, basic services High for CHW strategies Tribal housing authorities ~200 SDOH (housing conditions) Moderate for housing-health integration Tribal Head Start ~150 programs Early childhood health Moderate for maternal/child health Tribal elder programs ~400+ Nutrition, transportation, support High for aging-in-place Tribal behavioral health Varies widely Mental health, SUD treatment High for behavioral health integration Urban Indian Organizations: The Forgotten Sector Approximately 70% of American Indians and Alaska Natives now live in urban areas, yet the urban Indian health sector receives only 1% of the IHS budget. The 41 Urban Indian Organizations (UIOs) operating 85 facilities in 38 urban areas represent the primary healthcare infrastructure for urban Native populations.\nUIOs emerged from the disastrous federal relocation policies of the 1950s through 1970s that moved Native Americans from reservations to cities, then provided no healthcare infrastructure to serve them. Congress formally incorporated UIOs into the Indian health system through the Indian Health Care Improvement Act in 1976.\nUIOs are not tribes. They cannot access self-determination contracts or compacts the way tribes can. They rely almost entirely on the Urban Indian Health line item, which has remained essentially flat while costs increase. A 2025 survey found that 25% of UIOs would definitely need to furlough or lay off staff if federal funding were interrupted, and over half would not sustain operations beyond six months without federal funding.\nMedicaid is the largest revenue source for UIOs. In 2021, UIOs received over $137 million in Medicaid reimbursements, compared to approximately $90 million in direct federal funding. OBBBA Medicaid changes create significant risk for UIO revenues, even with American Indian and Alaska Native exemptions from work requirements.\nUIOs vary significantly in scope. Full ambulatory facilities provide comprehensive primary care. Limited ambulatory facilities offer specific services. Outreach and referral programs connect patients to other providers. Outpatient and residential programs focus on behavioral health. This variation means generalizations about UIO capacity are unreliable.\nRHTP Relevance for Urban Indian Organizations UIOs fall outside RHTP’s rural focus. Urban Native populations may not benefit from transformation investments despite experiencing similar health disparities. However:\nUrban-rural connection matters. Many tribal members move between urban and reservation areas. Care coordination across settings affects outcomes. RHTP investments in rural tribal health could create infrastructure that urban Native populations access during time on reservations.\nSome UIOs serve rural-adjacent populations. UIO service areas sometimes include surrounding rural counties. Clear urban/rural boundaries do not match Native population mobility.\nUIO models could inform rural approaches. UIOs have developed care coordination, cultural integration, and community health models that could adapt to rural tribal settings. Learning flows both directions.\nThe Partnership Tension RHTP operates through states. Tribal health operates through direct federal-to-tribal relationships. This structural difference creates fundamental tension when states seek to partner with tribal organizations for transformation.\nWhat Tribes Gain From Participation Resources. RHTP funding could supplement chronically underfunded tribal health programs. If participation does not compromise sovereignty, additional resources benefit tribal communities.\nCoordination. Many tribal members receive care from both tribal and non-tribal providers. RHTP investments in care coordination, health information exchange, and referral relationships could reduce fragmentation.\nWorkforce development. Tribal communities face severe workforce shortages. RHTP workforce investments could include tribal-specific training pathways, loan repayment incentives, and community health worker programs.\nInfrastructure. Telehealth, broadband, and technology investments benefit tribal communities that often lack infrastructure. Tribal participation in statewide technology initiatives could accelerate infrastructure development.\nWhat Tribes Risk From Participation Sovereignty compromise. State-administered programs may impose requirements that conflict with tribal approaches. Accepting state oversight of tribal health activities contradicts self-determination principles.\nReporting burdens. Federal programs already impose substantial reporting requirements on tribal programs. Adding state RHTP reporting creates additional administrative burden without additional administrative resources.\nCultural mismatch. State-designed programs may not accommodate cultural practices, traditional healing, or tribal definitions of health and wellness. Forcing tribal participation into state-defined frameworks undermines culturally-responsive care.\nAccountability confusion. Tribes are accountable to their members through tribal governance. Adding state accountability creates multiple, potentially conflicting, accountability relationships.\nThe Sovereignty Debate Navajo Nation Health Department received invitation to participate in Arizona’s RHTP implementation. The state proposed substantial resources: workforce development funding, telehealth infrastructure, and care coordination support. In exchange, Navajo programs would report to state oversight, meet state-defined metrics, and coordinate with state-designated regional entities.\nTribal council debate was intense. One faction argued for participation: resources were needed, coordination was valuable, and declining would leave Navajo communities without RHTP benefits while Arizona’s other rural areas received transformation investment. Another faction argued against: accepting state oversight undermined a century of work toward self-determination, metrics designed for non-tribal populations would not capture Navajo health values, and state coordination mechanisms would dilute Navajo control of Navajo health.\nThe council sought a third path: direct federal-to-tribal RHTP funding that would bypass state administration. CMS guidance was unclear. The question remained unresolved as planning deadlines approached.\nAlternative Perspective: The Integration View The sovereignty-first perspective has critics who argue that prioritizing sovereignty over pragmatic partnership harms tribal communities.\nIntegration enables resources. Tribal communities need healthcare resources urgently. The 8.3-year life expectancy gap between American Indian and Alaska Native populations and national averages represents ongoing crisis. Refusing participation that could reduce this gap because of sovereignty concerns prioritizes principle over outcomes.\nCoordination requires connection. Tribal members increasingly receive care across tribal and non-tribal settings. Refusing to coordinate with state systems creates fragmentation that harms patients. Effective care coordination may require some accommodation of state processes.\nIsolation perpetuates marginalization. Maintaining separate systems reinforces separation that has historically served tribal communities poorly. Strategic integration preserves tribal identity while enabling partnership that could improve outcomes.\nSovereignty does not require isolation. Self-determination means tribes choose their own path. If tribal leadership determines that partnership with state RHTP serves tribal interests, that choice is itself an exercise of sovereignty.\nAssessment: The integration view has partial validity. Tribal communities do need resources urgently. Coordination does benefit patients. Isolation is not inherently valuable. However, the integration view underestimates the history that makes sovereignty concerns not abstract but existential. Federal and state programs designed for tribal communities without tribal control have consistently failed or harmed those communities. Tribal caution about state-administered programs reflects experience, not paranoia. The solution is not tribal accommodation of state programs, but state accommodation of tribal sovereignty.\nCapacity Assessment: Tribal Community Organizations Organization Type State/Region Staff Budget Healthcare Role RHTP Potential Capacity Assessment Navajo Nation CHR CHR program AZ, NM, UT 250+ CHRs ~$15M Community outreach, basic care High High: established program, large scale Seattle Indian Health Board UIO WA 300+ ~$40M Comprehensive ambulatory Moderate (urban) High: strong organization Cherokee Nation Health Tribal health OK 4,000+ ~$700M Integrated system High High: major capacity Southcentral Foundation Tribal health AK 2,300+ ~$400M Nuka System of Care High High: nationally recognized model First Nations Community HealthSource UIO NM ~150 ~$15M Primary care, behavioral Moderate Moderate: growing capacity Tribal colleges (aggregate) Higher education Multiple Varies Varies Workforce training High Moderate: capacity varies Alaska CHAP CHW program AK 500+ CHAs ~$30M Community Health Aides High High: proven CHAP model The Community Health Aide Program: A Model Worth Understanding The Alaska Community Health Aide Program (CHAP) represents perhaps the most successful community health worker model in the United States and offers lessons for rural health transformation beyond tribal settings.\nCHAP trains Community Health Aides and Practitioners (CHA/Ps) to provide primary care services in remote Alaska villages where physicians and nurses cannot be recruited. Approximately 550 CHA/Ps serve over 170 villages across Alaska. CHA/Ps provide services including emergency stabilization, chronic disease management, prenatal care, health education, and basic procedures.\nThe program operates under a sophisticated supervision structure. CHA/Ps work with remote physician oversight through telehealth and consultation protocols. Training occurs in stages, with aides advancing through four levels of certification. Dental Health Aide Therapists (DHATs) extend the model to dental care, performing procedures traditionally reserved for dentists.\nOutcomes demonstrate effectiveness. Tribal health organizations operating CHAP have achieved vaccination rates, chronic disease management outcomes, and patient satisfaction levels comparable to or exceeding national benchmarks. The model proves that community-based workers with structured training and supervision can deliver quality care.\nExpansion beyond Alaska faces obstacles:\nState scope of practice laws. CHAP operates under federal authorization that preempts state scope of practice restrictions within tribal health programs. Expanding the model to non-tribal settings or other states requires navigating scope of practice laws that were designed before CHAP existed.\nTraining infrastructure. Alaska has built CHAP training capacity over decades. Other states lack equivalent infrastructure.\nCultural context. CHAP emerged from Alaska Native communities and reflects their values and relationships. Transplanting the model requires cultural adaptation that cannot simply replicate Alaska’s approach.\nRHTP could support CHAP expansion where appropriate. States with significant tribal populations could invest in Community Health Aide training aligned with tribal health needs. The model’s proven outcomes justify investment. Expansion requires tribal partnership, not state imposition.\nWhen Tribal Organizations Can Support Transformation Tribal and indigenous community organizations can contribute to rural health transformation when specific conditions exist:\nSovereignty is respected. Partnership must occur on government-to-government basis, not through state imposition of requirements on tribal programs. States that design RHTP implementation with tribal consultation from the beginning achieve better outcomes than those that add tribal considerations afterward.\nResources reach tribal communities. Participation must produce tangible benefits for tribal members. If partnership primarily serves state reporting needs without improving tribal health, participation serves no tribal interest.\nCultural responsiveness is built in. Metrics, programs, and approaches must accommodate tribal definitions of health and wellness. Western medical models that ignore traditional healing or community-based definitions of wellbeing will not succeed in tribal contexts.\nTribal capacity is adequate. Not all tribal organizations have capacity for transformation participation. Smaller tribes, those without self-determination experience, or those facing acute crises may lack organizational infrastructure for partnership. Capacity assessment should precede partnership expectations.\nTribal priorities drive tribal participation. Tribes should determine how they engage with RHTP, if at all. State-defined roles for tribal participation reverse the appropriate relationship.\nWhen Tribal Organizations Cannot Support Transformation Tribal and indigenous community organizations cannot support RHTP transformation when conditions preclude meaningful participation:\nState administration overrides tribal authority. When states position themselves as directing tribal health activities, regardless of language about consultation or partnership, the relationship undermines self-determination. Tribes may reasonably decline participation rather than accept subordinate status.\nResources come with unacceptable conditions. If RHTP participation requires compromising sovereignty, reporting in formats that distort tribal health realities, or implementing programs designed without tribal input, the conditions may exceed what resources justify.\nTribal capacity is insufficient. Some tribes lack organizational infrastructure for RHTP partnership regardless of sovereignty accommodation. Expecting participation from tribes without capacity sets both the tribe and RHTP up for failure.\nFederal-to-tribal pathways are unavailable. If CMS does not create mechanisms for direct federal-to-tribal RHTP funding that bypasses state administration, tribes must choose between state oversight and non-participation. Neither option serves tribal interests optimally.\nRecommendations For Tribal Organizations\nAssert sovereignty in partnership design. Accept RHTP partnership only on terms that respect self-determination. If state-proposed arrangements compromise sovereignty, negotiate different terms or decline participation. Sovereignty is not negotiable.\nAssess capacity honestly. Not every tribal organization can absorb RHTP partnership responsibilities. Capacity limitations are not failures; they reflect resource constraints that predate RHTP. Organizations should decline roles that exceed their capacity.\nCoordinate with other tribes. State RHTP consultation with individual tribes may not capture shared concerns. Inter-tribal coordination can present unified positions on sovereignty protection, resource allocation, and program design.\nDocument outcomes. Tribal health innovations often go undocumented in academic or policy literature. Systematic documentation of tribal approaches, outcomes, and lessons learned builds the evidence base for tribal health leadership.\nFor State Agencies\nConsult early and substantively. Tribal consultation is not checking a box. Meaningful consultation involves tribes in program design before decisions are made, incorporates tribal perspectives into final plans, and continues through implementation.\nCreate government-to-government relationships. States are not sovereigns over tribes. Partnership language should reflect peer relationships, not hierarchical arrangements with tribes as subordinate partners.\nAllow tribal-specific approaches. Tribal health is not simply rural health for tribal populations. Cultural practices, traditional healing, community definitions of wellness, and tribal governance structures may require approaches different from those designed for non-tribal rural populations.\nAdvocate for direct federal-to-tribal options. States that believe in tribal self-determination should advocate with CMS for mechanisms that allow tribes to access RHTP without state intermediation.\nAssess tribal capacity before expecting participation. Not all tribal organizations can participate in RHTP. States should assess capacity rather than assuming participation, and should not penalize tribes that cannot participate.\nFor CMS\nCreate direct federal-to-tribal RHTP pathways. Forcing tribes to access transformation funding through states contradicts self-determination. CMS should create mechanisms for tribal nations to receive and administer RHTP funds directly.\nEnsure RHTP tribal provisions enable genuine participation. Current requirements for state tribal consultation are necessary but not sufficient. Evaluation should assess whether consultation produced meaningful tribal influence, not merely whether consultation occurred.\nRespect tribal sovereignty in metrics and reporting. Tribal definitions of health and wellness may not align with standard RHTP metrics. Allow tribal-specific outcome measures that reflect tribal values.\nLearn from IHS and tribal health successes. Tribal health programs, particularly self-governance compacts and models like Southcentral Foundation’s Nuka System of Care, have achieved outcomes that exceed regional and national benchmarks. RHTP can learn from tribal health innovation rather than assuming tribes need state guidance.\nConclusion Tribal sovereignty is constitutional reality. The question is not whether to respect it, but how RHTP can achieve rural health transformation while honoring sovereign status. This is not primarily a legal question; it is a practical one. Transformation that excludes tribal communities fails those communities. Transformation that compromises sovereignty fails self-determination principles that tribes have fought generations to establish.\nThe evidence supports tribal-led approaches. Where tribes have genuine control over health programs through self-determination and self-governance, innovative models emerge. The Nuka System of Care, the Community Health Aide Program, and numerous tribal health successes demonstrate that tribal governance produces results. State-directed programs for tribal communities have historically failed.\nRHTP can support tribal health transformation by providing resources without imposing control. Direct federal-to-tribal pathways, sovereignty-respecting partnership structures, and cultural accommodation create conditions for tribal participation that serves both transformation goals and self-determination principles. States that approach tribal partnership with genuine respect will find capable partners. States that approach tribes as populations to be served rather than governments to engage will find resistance.\nThe 8.3-year life expectancy gap between American Indian and Alaska Native populations and national averages represents failure. That failure has specific causes: inadequate funding, workforce shortages, infrastructure deficits, and historical trauma that current service delivery cannot address alone. RHTP operates in this context. Transformation that works must work with tribal nations, not merely for tribal populations.\nCross-References Article 2E: Indian Health Service and Tribal Health Systems for detailed IHS analysis Series 9B: Tribal and Indigenous Communities for population-focused examination Series 4D: Community Health Workers for CHW model analysis including CHAP Series 5: State Agencies for tribal consultation requirements\nSources Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. “Rural Health Transformation Program: Tribal Consultation Requirements.” 2025.\nGovernment Accountability Office. “Indian Health Service: Spending Levels and Characteristics of IHS and Three Other Federal Health Care Programs.” GAO-19-74, 2018.\nIndian Health Service. “IHS Profile.” Accessed January 2026. https://www.ihs.gov/\nIndian Health Service. “Tribal Self-Governance.” Accessed January 2026. https://www.ihs.gov/selfgovernance/\nNational Congress of American Indians. “Tribal Nations and the United States: An Introduction.” 2020.\nNational Council of Urban Indian Health. “2025 Advocacy Priorities.” Accessed January 2026.\nNational Indian Health Board. “Tribal Budget Formulation Recommendations.” FY2026.\nRoubideaux, Yvette. “Self-Determination and Health Care.” New England Journal of Medicine, 2021.\nSouthcentral Foundation. “The Nuka System of Care.” Accessed January 2026. https://www.southcentralfoundation.com/nuka/\nSupreme Court of the United States. “Becerra v.

<p>Tribal nations are sovereign governments. This is constitutional reality, not policy perspective. The federal government has <strong>government-to-government relationships</strong> with 574 federally recognized tribes, relationships predating the United States itself. When RHTP requires states to consult with tribal affairs offices during transformation planning, it acknowledges a fundamental reality: tribal health constitutes a <strong>parallel system</strong> with its own funding streams, delivery structures, governance mechanisms, and legal framework.</p>
<p>The tension between tribal sovereignty and federal program requirements shapes every aspect of tribal health organization participation in transformation. Sovereignty means tribes have the right to determine their own approaches to health and social welfare. Federal programs have requirements: reporting, accountability, performance metrics, standardized implementation. When sovereignty and requirements conflict, which prevails?</p>
<p>This article examines tribal and indigenous community organizations beyond the formal tribal health system, including Native nonprofits, urban Indian organizations, and community-based initiatives that serve American Indian and Alaska Native populations. These organizations navigate the same sovereignty tensions while often operating outside direct tribal government control. Understanding their capacity and constraints matters for RHTP implementation in states with significant Native populations.</p>
<h2 id="the-sovereignty-framework">The Sovereignty Framework<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-sovereignty-framework">#</a></h2>
<p>The federal trust responsibility for tribal health emerged from treaties, statutes, and Supreme Court precedent establishing the United States government&rsquo;s obligation to provide healthcare services to American Indians and Alaska Natives. This obligation <strong>does not flow through states</strong>. It flows directly from the federal government to tribal nations.</p>
<p><strong>574 federally recognized tribes</strong> hold sovereignty status. Each tribe has distinct governance, health priorities, and relationships with federal and state governments. Generalizing about tribal health organizations risks ignoring this diversity, but certain structural features are common.</p>
<p><strong>Self-determination</strong> is the operating policy framework. The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975 enables tribes to assume operation of programs that the Indian Health Service would otherwise provide directly. As of 2024, <strong>526 of 574 tribes (92%)</strong> had self-determination contracts, and <strong>295 tribes (51%)</strong> had self-governance compacts. Tribes administer over <strong>60% of the IHS budget</strong> through these mechanisms.</p>
<p>Self-determination has produced both innovative programs and significant challenges:</p>
<p><strong>Innovative outcomes.</strong> Tribes operating their own health programs have developed culturally-responsive services that IHS direct provision could not. Some tribal health systems outperform regional averages on key measures. The flexibility of self-governance compacts has enabled integrated approaches combining healthcare, behavioral health, and social services.</p>
<p><strong>Capacity challenges.</strong> Assuming federal program operation requires administrative infrastructure, financial management systems, human resources functions, and clinical leadership that some tribes possess and others must build. Not all tribes have benefited equally from self-determination.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Termination by appropriation&rdquo; concerns.</strong> Some tribes worry that if they assume all service delivery responsibility, the federal government retains only funding obligations it can more easily reduce or eliminate. Federal trust responsibility remains regardless of service delivery arrangement, but funding levels remain subject to congressional appropriation.</p>
<h2 id="tribal-community-organizations-beyond-healthcare">Tribal Community Organizations Beyond Healthcare<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#tribal-community-organizations-beyond-healthcare">#</a></h2>
<p>Tribal nations have community organizations serving functions beyond formal health services. These organizations represent potential partners for RHTP implementation, if partnership can respect sovereignty while meeting program requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Tribal colleges and universities.</strong> Thirty-five tribally controlled colleges and universities serve approximately 30,000 students. These institutions often operate community health programs, train healthcare workers, and conduct health research relevant to tribal communities. Several tribal colleges have nursing or allied health programs that could support workforce development.</p>
<p><strong>Tribal housing authorities.</strong> Housing affects health. Tribal housing authorities operate approximately 78,000 housing units serving tribal members. Housing conditions, including water and sanitation infrastructure, directly affect health outcomes. IHS sanitation facilities construction programs work with tribal housing authorities on basic infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>Tribal community health representative (CHR) programs.</strong> Community Health Representatives are paraprofessional community members who provide health education, outreach, and basic services in tribal communities. The CHR program dates to 1968 and represents one of the earliest community health worker models in the United States. Approximately <strong>1,600 CHRs</strong> serve tribal communities nationally.</p>
<p><strong>Tribal Head Start and early childhood programs.</strong> American Indian and Alaska Native Head Start programs serve young children and families, with health components including screenings, health education, and connection to services.</p>
<p><strong>Tribal elder programs.</strong> Tribal programs serving elders often provide health-related services including nutrition, transportation, and caregiver support. Elder care has particular cultural significance in many tribal communities.</p>
<p><strong>Tribal behavioral health programs.</strong> Tribal communities face disproportionate behavioral health burdens including suicide rates among the highest of any population group. Tribal behavioral health programs often integrate traditional healing practices with clinical services.</p>

<p>Approximately <strong>70% of American Indians and Alaska Natives now live in urban areas</strong>, yet the urban Indian health sector receives only <strong>1% of the IHS budget</strong>. The 41 Urban Indian Organizations (UIOs) operating 85 facilities in 38 urban areas represent the primary healthcare infrastructure for urban Native populations.</p>
<p>UIOs emerged from the disastrous federal relocation policies of the 1950s through 1970s that moved Native Americans from reservations to cities, then provided no healthcare infrastructure to serve them. Congress formally incorporated UIOs into the Indian health system through the Indian Health Care Improvement Act in 1976.</p>
<p><strong>UIOs are not tribes.</strong> They cannot access self-determination contracts or compacts the way tribes can. They rely almost entirely on the Urban Indian Health line item, which has remained essentially flat while costs increase. A 2025 survey found that <strong>25% of UIOs would definitely need to furlough or lay off staff</strong> if federal funding were interrupted, and <strong>over half would not sustain operations beyond six months</strong> without federal funding.</p>
<p><strong>Medicaid is the largest revenue source for UIOs.</strong> In 2021, UIOs received over <strong>$137 million in Medicaid reimbursements</strong>, compared to approximately $90 million in direct federal funding. OBBBA Medicaid changes create significant risk for UIO revenues, even with American Indian and Alaska Native exemptions from work requirements.</p>
<p>UIOs vary significantly in scope. <strong>Full ambulatory facilities</strong> provide comprehensive primary care. <strong>Limited ambulatory facilities</strong> offer specific services. <strong>Outreach and referral programs</strong> connect patients to other providers. <strong>Outpatient and residential programs</strong> focus on behavioral health. This variation means generalizations about UIO capacity are unreliable.</p>
<h3 id="rhtp-relevance-for-urban-indian-organizations">RHTP Relevance for Urban Indian Organizations<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#rhtp-relevance-for-urban-indian-organizations">#</a></h3>
<p>UIOs fall outside RHTP&rsquo;s rural focus. Urban Native populations may not benefit from transformation investments despite experiencing similar health disparities. However:</p>
<p><strong>Urban-rural connection matters.</strong> Many tribal members move between urban and reservation areas. Care coordination across settings affects outcomes. RHTP investments in rural tribal health could create infrastructure that urban Native populations access during time on reservations.</p>
<p><strong>Some UIOs serve rural-adjacent populations.</strong> UIO service areas sometimes include surrounding rural counties. Clear urban/rural boundaries do not match Native population mobility.</p>
<p><strong>UIO models could inform rural approaches.</strong> UIOs have developed care coordination, cultural integration, and community health models that could adapt to rural tribal settings. Learning flows both directions.</p>
<h2 id="the-partnership-tension">The Partnership Tension<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-partnership-tension">#</a></h2>
<p>RHTP operates through states. Tribal health operates through direct federal-to-tribal relationships. This structural difference creates fundamental tension when states seek to partner with tribal organizations for transformation.</p>
<h3 id="what-tribes-gain-from-participation">What Tribes Gain From Participation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-tribes-gain-from-participation">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Resources.</strong> RHTP funding could supplement chronically underfunded tribal health programs. If participation does not compromise sovereignty, additional resources benefit tribal communities.</p>
<p><strong>Coordination.</strong> Many tribal members receive care from both tribal and non-tribal providers. RHTP investments in care coordination, health information exchange, and referral relationships could reduce fragmentation.</p>
<p><strong>Workforce development.</strong> Tribal communities face severe workforce shortages. RHTP workforce investments could include tribal-specific training pathways, loan repayment incentives, and community health worker programs.</p>
<p><strong>Infrastructure.</strong> Telehealth, broadband, and technology investments benefit tribal communities that often lack infrastructure. Tribal participation in statewide technology initiatives could accelerate infrastructure development.</p>
<h3 id="what-tribes-risk-from-participation">What Tribes Risk From Participation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-tribes-risk-from-participation">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Sovereignty compromise.</strong> State-administered programs may impose requirements that conflict with tribal approaches. Accepting state oversight of tribal health activities contradicts self-determination principles.</p>
<p><strong>Reporting burdens.</strong> Federal programs already impose substantial reporting requirements on tribal programs. Adding state RHTP reporting creates additional administrative burden without additional administrative resources.</p>
<p><strong>Cultural mismatch.</strong> State-designed programs may not accommodate cultural practices, traditional healing, or tribal definitions of health and wellness. Forcing tribal participation into state-defined frameworks undermines culturally-responsive care.</p>
<p><strong>Accountability confusion.</strong> Tribes are accountable to their members through tribal governance. Adding state accountability creates multiple, potentially conflicting, accountability relationships.</p>
<h3 id="the-sovereignty-debate">The Sovereignty Debate<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-sovereignty-debate">#</a></h3>
<p><em>Navajo Nation Health Department received invitation to participate in Arizona&rsquo;s RHTP implementation. The state proposed substantial resources: workforce development funding, telehealth infrastructure, and care coordination support. In exchange, Navajo programs would report to state oversight, meet state-defined metrics, and coordinate with state-designated regional entities.</em></p>
<p><em>Tribal council debate was intense. One faction argued for participation: resources were needed, coordination was valuable, and declining would leave Navajo communities without RHTP benefits while Arizona&rsquo;s other rural areas received transformation investment. Another faction argued against: accepting state oversight undermined a century of work toward self-determination, metrics designed for non-tribal populations would not capture Navajo health values, and state coordination mechanisms would dilute Navajo control of Navajo health.</em></p>
<p><em>The council sought a third path: direct federal-to-tribal RHTP funding that would bypass state administration. CMS guidance was unclear. The question remained unresolved as planning deadlines approached.</em></p>
<h2 id="alternative-perspective-the-integration-view">Alternative Perspective: The Integration View<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#alternative-perspective-the-integration-view">#</a></h2>
<p>The sovereignty-first perspective has critics who argue that prioritizing sovereignty over pragmatic partnership harms tribal communities.</p>
<p><strong>Integration enables resources.</strong> Tribal communities need healthcare resources urgently. The 8.3-year life expectancy gap between American Indian and Alaska Native populations and national averages represents ongoing crisis. Refusing participation that could reduce this gap because of sovereignty concerns prioritizes principle over outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Coordination requires connection.</strong> Tribal members increasingly receive care across tribal and non-tribal settings. Refusing to coordinate with state systems creates fragmentation that harms patients. Effective care coordination may require some accommodation of state processes.</p>
<p><strong>Isolation perpetuates marginalization.</strong> Maintaining separate systems reinforces separation that has historically served tribal communities poorly. Strategic integration preserves tribal identity while enabling partnership that could improve outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Sovereignty does not require isolation.</strong> Self-determination means tribes choose their own path. If tribal leadership determines that partnership with state RHTP serves tribal interests, that choice is itself an exercise of sovereignty.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment:</strong> The integration view has partial validity. Tribal communities do need resources urgently. Coordination does benefit patients. Isolation is not inherently valuable. However, the integration view underestimates the history that makes sovereignty concerns not abstract but existential. Federal and state programs designed for tribal communities without tribal control have consistently failed or harmed those communities. Tribal caution about state-administered programs reflects experience, not paranoia. The solution is not tribal accommodation of state programs, but state accommodation of tribal sovereignty.</p>

<h2 id="the-community-health-aide-program-a-model-worth-understanding">The Community Health Aide Program: A Model Worth Understanding<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-community-health-aide-program-a-model-worth-understanding">#</a></h2>
<p>The Alaska Community Health Aide Program (CHAP) represents perhaps the most successful community health worker model in the United States and offers lessons for rural health transformation beyond tribal settings.</p>
<p><strong>CHAP trains Community Health Aides and Practitioners (CHA/Ps)</strong> to provide primary care services in remote Alaska villages where physicians and nurses cannot be recruited. Approximately <strong>550 CHA/Ps</strong> serve over <strong>170 villages</strong> across Alaska. CHA/Ps provide services including emergency stabilization, chronic disease management, prenatal care, health education, and basic procedures.</p>
<p>The program operates under a sophisticated supervision structure. CHA/Ps work with remote physician oversight through telehealth and consultation protocols. Training occurs in stages, with aides advancing through four levels of certification. <strong>Dental Health Aide Therapists (DHATs)</strong> extend the model to dental care, performing procedures traditionally reserved for dentists.</p>
<p><strong>Outcomes demonstrate effectiveness.</strong> Tribal health organizations operating CHAP have achieved vaccination rates, chronic disease management outcomes, and patient satisfaction levels comparable to or exceeding national benchmarks. The model proves that community-based workers with structured training and supervision can deliver quality care.</p>
<p><strong>Expansion beyond Alaska faces obstacles:</strong></p>
<p><strong>State scope of practice laws.</strong> CHAP operates under federal authorization that preempts state scope of practice restrictions within tribal health programs. Expanding the model to non-tribal settings or other states requires navigating scope of practice laws that were designed before CHAP existed.</p>
<p><strong>Training infrastructure.</strong> Alaska has built CHAP training capacity over decades. Other states lack equivalent infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>Cultural context.</strong> CHAP emerged from Alaska Native communities and reflects their values and relationships. Transplanting the model requires cultural adaptation that cannot simply replicate Alaska&rsquo;s approach.</p>
<p><strong>RHTP could support CHAP expansion where appropriate.</strong> States with significant tribal populations could invest in Community Health Aide training aligned with tribal health needs. The model&rsquo;s proven outcomes justify investment. Expansion requires tribal partnership, not state imposition.</p>
<h2 id="when-tribal-organizations-can-support-transformation">When Tribal Organizations Can Support Transformation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#when-tribal-organizations-can-support-transformation">#</a></h2>
<p>Tribal and indigenous community organizations can contribute to rural health transformation when specific conditions exist:</p>
<p><strong>Sovereignty is respected.</strong> Partnership must occur on government-to-government basis, not through state imposition of requirements on tribal programs. States that design RHTP implementation with tribal consultation from the beginning achieve better outcomes than those that add tribal considerations afterward.</p>
<p><strong>Resources reach tribal communities.</strong> Participation must produce tangible benefits for tribal members. If partnership primarily serves state reporting needs without improving tribal health, participation serves no tribal interest.</p>
<p><strong>Cultural responsiveness is built in.</strong> Metrics, programs, and approaches must accommodate tribal definitions of health and wellness. Western medical models that ignore traditional healing or community-based definitions of wellbeing will not succeed in tribal contexts.</p>
<p><strong>Tribal capacity is adequate.</strong> Not all tribal organizations have capacity for transformation participation. Smaller tribes, those without self-determination experience, or those facing acute crises may lack organizational infrastructure for partnership. Capacity assessment should precede partnership expectations.</p>
<p><strong>Tribal priorities drive tribal participation.</strong> Tribes should determine how they engage with RHTP, if at all. State-defined roles for tribal participation reverse the appropriate relationship.</p>
<h2 id="when-tribal-organizations-cannot-support-transformation">When Tribal Organizations Cannot Support Transformation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#when-tribal-organizations-cannot-support-transformation">#</a></h2>
<p>Tribal and indigenous community organizations cannot support RHTP transformation when conditions preclude meaningful participation:</p>
<p><strong>State administration overrides tribal authority.</strong> When states position themselves as directing tribal health activities, regardless of language about consultation or partnership, the relationship undermines self-determination. Tribes may reasonably decline participation rather than accept subordinate status.</p>
<p><strong>Resources come with unacceptable conditions.</strong> If RHTP participation requires compromising sovereignty, reporting in formats that distort tribal health realities, or implementing programs designed without tribal input, the conditions may exceed what resources justify.</p>
<p><strong>Tribal capacity is insufficient.</strong> Some tribes lack organizational infrastructure for RHTP partnership regardless of sovereignty accommodation. Expecting participation from tribes without capacity sets both the tribe and RHTP up for failure.</p>
<p><strong>Federal-to-tribal pathways are unavailable.</strong> If CMS does not create mechanisms for direct federal-to-tribal RHTP funding that bypasses state administration, tribes must choose between state oversight and non-participation. Neither option serves tribal interests optimally.</p>
<h2 id="recommendations">Recommendations<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#recommendations">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>For Tribal Organizations</strong></p>
<p>Assert sovereignty in partnership design. Accept RHTP partnership only on terms that respect self-determination. If state-proposed arrangements compromise sovereignty, negotiate different terms or decline participation. Sovereignty is not negotiable.</p>
<p>Assess capacity honestly. Not every tribal organization can absorb RHTP partnership responsibilities. Capacity limitations are not failures; they reflect resource constraints that predate RHTP. Organizations should decline roles that exceed their capacity.</p>
<p>Coordinate with other tribes. State RHTP consultation with individual tribes may not capture shared concerns. Inter-tribal coordination can present unified positions on sovereignty protection, resource allocation, and program design.</p>
<p>Document outcomes. Tribal health innovations often go undocumented in academic or policy literature. Systematic documentation of tribal approaches, outcomes, and lessons learned builds the evidence base for tribal health leadership.</p>
<p><strong>For State Agencies</strong></p>
<p>Consult early and substantively. Tribal consultation is not checking a box. Meaningful consultation involves tribes in program design before decisions are made, incorporates tribal perspectives into final plans, and continues through implementation.</p>
<p>Create government-to-government relationships. States are not sovereigns over tribes. Partnership language should reflect peer relationships, not hierarchical arrangements with tribes as subordinate partners.</p>
<p>Allow tribal-specific approaches. Tribal health is not simply rural health for tribal populations. Cultural practices, traditional healing, community definitions of wellness, and tribal governance structures may require approaches different from those designed for non-tribal rural populations.</p>
<p>Advocate for direct federal-to-tribal options. States that believe in tribal self-determination should advocate with CMS for mechanisms that allow tribes to access RHTP without state intermediation.</p>
<p>Assess tribal capacity before expecting participation. Not all tribal organizations can participate in RHTP. States should assess capacity rather than assuming participation, and should not penalize tribes that cannot participate.</p>
<p><strong>For CMS</strong></p>
<p>Create direct federal-to-tribal RHTP pathways. Forcing tribes to access transformation funding through states contradicts self-determination. CMS should create mechanisms for tribal nations to receive and administer RHTP funds directly.</p>
<p>Ensure RHTP tribal provisions enable genuine participation. Current requirements for state tribal consultation are necessary but not sufficient. Evaluation should assess whether consultation produced meaningful tribal influence, not merely whether consultation occurred.</p>
<p>Respect tribal sovereignty in metrics and reporting. Tribal definitions of health and wellness may not align with standard RHTP metrics. Allow tribal-specific outcome measures that reflect tribal values.</p>
<p>Learn from IHS and tribal health successes. Tribal health programs, particularly self-governance compacts and models like Southcentral Foundation&rsquo;s Nuka System of Care, have achieved outcomes that exceed regional and national benchmarks. RHTP can learn from tribal health innovation rather than assuming tribes need state guidance.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>Tribal sovereignty is constitutional reality. The question is not whether to respect it, but how RHTP can achieve rural health transformation while honoring sovereign status. This is not primarily a legal question; it is a practical one. Transformation that excludes tribal communities fails those communities. Transformation that compromises sovereignty fails self-determination principles that tribes have fought generations to establish.</p>
<p><strong>The evidence supports tribal-led approaches.</strong> Where tribes have genuine control over health programs through self-determination and self-governance, innovative models emerge. The Nuka System of Care, the Community Health Aide Program, and numerous tribal health successes demonstrate that tribal governance produces results. State-directed programs for tribal communities have historically failed.</p>
<p>RHTP can support tribal health transformation by providing resources without imposing control. Direct federal-to-tribal pathways, sovereignty-respecting partnership structures, and cultural accommodation create conditions for tribal participation that serves both transformation goals and self-determination principles. States that approach tribal partnership with genuine respect will find capable partners. States that approach tribes as populations to be served rather than governments to engage will find resistance.</p>
<p>The 8.3-year life expectancy gap between American Indian and Alaska Native populations and national averages represents failure. That failure has specific causes: inadequate funding, workforce shortages, infrastructure deficits, and historical trauma that current service delivery cannot address alone. RHTP operates in this context. Transformation that works must work with tribal nations, not merely for tribal populations.</p>
