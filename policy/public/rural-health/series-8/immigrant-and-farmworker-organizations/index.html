  "articleBody": "Rural America’s food production depends on workers who remain largely invisible in health policy. Approximately 2.4 million farmworkers harvest the nation’s crops, process its meat, and maintain its agricultural infrastructure. An estimated 50% lack documented immigration status. The vast majority lack health insurance. They experience occupational exposures, chronic disease burdens, and mental health challenges that exceed general population rates. Yet rural health transformation frameworks routinely ignore them.\nImmigrant and farmworker organizations serve these populations despite hostile policy environments, uncertain legal terrain, and funding constraints that make their work precarious. They navigate between population need and political sensitivity, between authentic community connection and institutional requirements that could expose the people they serve. RHTP’s promise to transform rural health for “all rural residents” tests whether transformation can reach populations that politics renders invisible.\nThis article examines whether immigrant and farmworker organizations can participate in RHTP implementation, the tensions between serving marginalized populations and operating within federal frameworks, and what honest assessment reveals about transformation’s reach. The evidence suggests that serving invisible populations requires intentional design, not generic rural health programming that ignores who actually lives and works in rural communities.\nThe Population Reality Who Farmworkers Are The agricultural workforce defies easy categorization. Migratory agricultural workers follow crops across states, establishing temporary homes for seasonal employment. Seasonal agricultural workers remain in single locations but work only during growing seasons. Both populations share characteristics that distinguish them from other rural residents.\nAccording to the National Agricultural Workers Survey, the farmworker population is predominantly Hispanic (83%), overwhelmingly male (69%), and relatively young (median age 41). Foreign-born workers constitute approximately 65% of the workforce, with Mexico as the primary country of origin. Educational attainment is low: median years of schooling is 9, and 26% report completing fewer than 6 years of education.\nIncome places farmworkers among the poorest workers in America. Median personal income is approximately $20,000 to $25,000 annually for those working 200+ days. Family income remains below poverty thresholds for substantial portions of the population. Work is physically demanding, frequently dangerous, and often performed in conditions that compromise health.\nImmigration Status Complexity Farmworker immigration status creates healthcare access barriers that legal residents do not face. Estimates suggest approximately 50% of farmworkers lack work authorization, though precise figures are impossible to obtain. Those with temporary work visas (H-2A) have limited access to public benefits. Those with documentation may still experience language barriers, mobility challenges, and fear based on family members’ status.\nThe mixed-status family is common: citizen children with undocumented parents, documented spouses with undocumented partners, extended family networks spanning legal categories. Healthcare decisions cannot be separated from immigration enforcement fears. A parent delaying care may be protecting family stability rather than exhibiting health-neglecting behavior.\nHealth Status and Occupational Exposure Farmworker health reflects occupational hazards and access limitations. Pesticide exposure causes acute illness and chronic neurological effects. Heat illness kills farmworkers at rates far exceeding other occupations. Musculoskeletal injuries from repetitive motion and heavy lifting accumulate over working years. Eye injuries, respiratory conditions from dust and chemical exposure, and skin conditions are endemic.\nChronic disease prevalence is high. Diabetes, hypertension, and obesity rates exceed national averages. Mental health challenges include depression, anxiety, isolation, and family separation stress. Substance use, particularly alcohol, reflects coping mechanisms for difficult conditions.\nAccess barriers compound health risks. Fewer than 20% of farmworkers have employer-provided health insurance. Medicaid eligibility is limited for undocumented workers and varies by state for documented immigrants. Language barriers, transportation challenges, work schedules that conflict with clinic hours, and fear of authorities all reduce healthcare utilization.\nThe result is a population with high health needs, low health access, and minimal visibility in the policy systems that could address their conditions.\nThe Organizational Landscape Organizations serving farmworkers and immigrants have developed over decades, often operating in parallel to mainstream rural health systems rather than integrated within them.\nMigrant Health Centers The federal Migrant Health Program, authorized by the 1962 Migrant Health Act and now administered under Section 330(g) of the Public Health Service Act, provides the primary healthcare infrastructure serving farmworkers. In 2024, 177 federally funded migrant health center grantees operated across the United States. These centers served approximately 1 million farmworkers and family members in 2023, representing roughly one-third of the estimated farmworker population.\nMigrant Health Centers operate as Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) with specific mandates to serve agricultural workers. They provide culturally and linguistically appropriate primary care, preventive services, dental care, behavioral health, and pharmacy services. Many operate from both fixed and mobile sites, following harvest patterns to reach workers where they live and work. Sliding-fee scales ensure services remain affordable regardless of insurance status.\nThe FQHC designation provides financial sustainability that standalone farmworker organizations cannot achieve. Health centers receive federal operating grants and enhanced Medicaid reimbursement rates, enabling services that market economics would not support. However, Migrant Health Center coverage remains incomplete. Two-thirds of farmworkers lack access to these specialized services.\nAdvocacy and Legal Service Organizations Beyond healthcare, organizations serve farmworkers through advocacy, legal assistance, and community organizing. Farmworker Justice, based in Washington, D.C., advocates for improved wages, working conditions, immigration policy, and health protections. The organization provides training and technical assistance to Migrant Health Centers and influences federal policy.\nLegal aid organizations across agricultural states help farmworkers navigate immigration status, workplace rights, and access to benefits. Organizations like California Rural Legal Assistance, Texas RioGrande Legal Aid, and Florida Legal Services provide representation that individual farmworkers cannot afford.\nCommunity-Based Organizations Immigrant-serving community organizations operate at local levels, often with minimal budgets and volunteer leadership. Churches, mutual aid networks, and hometown associations provide social support, emergency assistance, and connection to services. These organizations have authentic community relationships that larger institutions cannot replicate.\nPromotores de salud (community health workers) programs embed health outreach within immigrant communities. Promotores share language, culture, and lived experience with the populations they serve. Programs like MHP Salud train and deploy promotores in farmworker and border communities across multiple states.\nOrganizational Capacity Assessment Organization Type Region Staff Budget Healthcare Role RHTP Potential Capacity Assessment Migrant Clinicians Network National TA provider National 25+ $5M+ Training, technical assistance, care coordination High (intermediary role) Strong professional capacity; limited direct service National Center for Farmworker Health National TA provider National 20+ $4M+ Research, training, resources High (knowledge/TA) Strong technical capacity; no direct service Farmworker Justice Advocacy National 15+ $3M+ Policy advocacy, legal assistance Moderate (advocacy) Professional capacity; policy focus La Clinica del CariÃ±o FQHC Oregon 100+ $15M+ Primary care, dental, behavioral High (direct service) Professional capacity; service delivery Migrant Health Promotion CHW training Michigan/national 10+ $1M+ CHW training, community outreach Moderate (workforce) Specialized; limited scale Sun Street Centers Social services California 50+ $5M+ Substance use, family services Moderate (social services) Service capacity; limited healthcare El Centro de la Raza Community services Washington 100+ $10M+ Multiple social services Moderate (comprehensive) Broad services; limited health focus Pineros y Campesinos Unidos del Noroeste (PCUN) Worker organization Oregon 20+ $2M+ Advocacy, services, organizing Low (advocacy focus) Community connection; limited service capacity The landscape reveals significant variation in organizational capacity. National technical assistance organizations have professional infrastructure but do not deliver direct services. FQHCs have healthcare delivery capacity but face enrollment and reach limitations. Community organizations have authentic relationships but often lack capacity for formal program participation.\nThe Core Tensions Tension 1: Serving Marginalized Populations Within Hostile Policy Environments Immigrant and farmworker organizations exist in policy environments that often work against their populations. Immigration enforcement creates fear that suppresses healthcare utilization. State policies in many agricultural states restrict immigrant access to public benefits. Political rhetoric frames immigrants as threats rather than essential workers.\nThe Hostile Environment Reality: Organizations serving farmworkers operate under conditions that healthcare providers serving other populations do not face. A health outreach program that collects personal information may deter participation if workers fear data could be shared with immigration authorities. A clinic located near an ICE enforcement area may see utilization drop regardless of actual enforcement actions. Fear is a public health barrier that policy creates.\nFederal funds come with federal oversight. Organizations accepting RHTP subawards must comply with reporting requirements, demographic data collection, and program monitoring that could expose the populations they serve. The tension between serving invisible populations and participating in visible federal programs is not theoretical.\nThe Service Imperative View: Farmworkers need healthcare regardless of political environment. Organizations that refuse federal funding to protect population invisibility abandon populations to worse outcomes. Participation in federal programs, even imperfect ones, brings resources that communities need. Strategic engagement serves communities better than principled withdrawal.\nAssessment: Both perspectives have validity. The hostile environment is real, and participation risks are genuine. But absence from federal programs also has costs. Effective organizations navigate this tension through careful program design, community trust building, and explicit protections that reduce risk while capturing resources. Organizations that cannot navigate this tension may protect populations from federal visibility while leaving health needs unaddressed.\nTension 2: RHTP’s “All Rural Residents” Promise vs. Political Reality RHTP’s statutory mandate applies to rural health transformation without distinguishing populations by immigration status. The program aims to serve “rural residents” comprehensively. But political sensitivity around immigrant populations affects how states design programs and select subawardees.\nThe Universality Promise: Federal law authorizes serving rural populations. RHTP funding should reach all rural residents, including farmworkers and immigrants who live, work, and contribute to rural communities. Excluding essential workers from essential health programs contradicts transformation logic.\nThe Political Reality: State agencies implement RHTP. In states with anti-immigrant political environments, explicitly including farmworker services may generate controversy that threatens the entire program. State officials may avoid farmworker-specific language not from hostility but from political calculation about program survival.\nThe Invisibility Result: When RHTP implementation documents describe “rural residents” without mentioning farmworkers, immigrant health organizations may not apply for subawards. When workforce initiatives describe “community health workers” without referencing promotores, culturally appropriate models may not receive support. Invisibility in program design produces invisibility in program implementation.\nAssessment: The gap between federal authorization and state implementation represents transformation failure. States serving agricultural populations cannot achieve rural health transformation while ignoring agricultural workers. But organizations serving farmworkers bear costs for making this argument publicly. Advocacy for inclusion risks retaliation; silence accepts exclusion.\nVignette: Navigating Federal Funding in Hostile Territory The Valley Farmworker Health Coalition has served migrant workers across three agricultural counties for 25 years. Operating through a network of mobile clinics, promotores, and partnerships with growers, the organization reached 8,000 workers annually with immunizations, chronic disease management, and prenatal care. Funding came through a mix of HRSA grants, foundation support, and modest grower contributions.\nWhen the state announced RHTP subaward opportunities, the Coalition saw potential to expand services. The application requested $1.2 million over three years for additional mobile units, expanded promotora programs, and behavioral health integration. The proposal detailed farmworker health needs with data the state rarely saw.\nThe state review committee praised the application’s quality but hesitated over its population focus. “Serving farmworkers is appropriate,” one reviewer noted, “but is it appropriate to highlight in a state program?” The committee asked whether the application could be reframed around “agricultural communities” without explicit farmworker focus.\nCoalition leadership faced a choice. Reframing would secure funding but obscure the population being served. Maintaining explicit farmworker focus might lose funding entirely. Staff worried that accepting obscured framing would set precedent for invisibility in state programs.\nThe Coalition chose explicit framing and received a reduced award focused on “rural health outreach” without farmworker-specific language. Mobile units would serve farmworker communities but report outcomes as general rural health. Promotores would be funded as “community health workers” without cultural specificity.\nCoalition leadership felt compromised. They had secured resources but accepted framing that made their population invisible in official programs. “We help the people we serve,” the Executive Director reflected, “but we also let the state pretend they don’t exist.”\nAlternative Perspective: The Invisibility Critique Rural health policy routinely ignores populations without political power. Farmworkers harvest food that feeds the nation but cannot vote, cannot donate to campaigns, and fear visibility that might invite enforcement attention. Economically essential but politically invisible, farmworkers reveal transformation’s limits.\nThe Critique’s Core Argument: RHTP that does not explicitly include farmworker provisions fails transformation’s equity claims. Generic “rural health” programming that avoids naming farmworkers accepts their exclusion by default. If transformation serves only populations with political voice, it is not transformation but maintenance of existing hierarchies with new funding.\nEvidence Supporting the Critique: Analysis of RHTP state applications reveals minimal explicit farmworker provisions outside states with established Migrant Health infrastructure. When applications mention “agricultural communities,” they often reference farmers and ranchers rather than workers. Who counts as a rural resident shapes who receives transformation benefits.\nCounter-Argument: States cannot transform systems they do not control. Immigration policy is federal. Labor law enforcement is inconsistent. State health agencies serving farmworkers cannot solve problems created by federal immigration policy and employer practices. Targeting limited transformation resources toward populations states can actually serve may produce better outcomes than symbolic inclusion that delivers little.\nAssessment: The invisibility critique has substantial validity. Rural health transformation that excludes essential workers is incomplete transformation. But the critique does not provide implementation guidance for organizations navigating hostile environments. Visibility has costs that populations, not critics, bear. The tension between naming populations and protecting them is genuine.\nWhen Immigrant/Farmworker Organizations Can Support Transformation Conditions enabling effective participation exist in some contexts:\nSupportive State Policy Environments: States with immigrant-inclusive policies, Medicaid expansion covering qualifying immigrants, and political cultures that value farmworker contributions create space for explicit program participation. California, Oregon, Washington, and other states with established farmworker health infrastructure demonstrate how inclusion can work.\nEstablished Migrant Health Infrastructure: Where Migrant Health Centers already operate, RHTP can strengthen existing programs rather than creating new ones. The FQHC platform provides compliance capacity, billing infrastructure, and community relationships that support expanded services. RHTP subawards can supplement 330(g) funding without requiring new organizational development.\nHealthcare Partners Committed to Comprehensive Service: When hospitals, health systems, and other RHTP participants view farmworkers as part of their service population, immigrant organizations can participate as partners rather than isolated advocates. Integration into broader transformation coalitions protects farmworker services from political isolation.\nOrganizational Capacity for Federal Compliance: Organizations with professional financial management, reporting systems, and compliance infrastructure can accept federal funds without administrative crisis. This typically means FQHCs, larger nonprofits with government contract experience, or organizations partnering with fiscal sponsors that provide compliance support.\nWhen Immigrant/Farmworker Organizations Cannot Support Transformation Conditions limiting participation are widespread:\nHostile State Policy Environments: States with anti-immigrant political climates, enforcement cooperation agreements, and restricted benefit access create environments where explicit farmworker program participation is impossible. Organizations may continue serving populations but cannot participate visibly in state-administered programs without endangering those they serve.\nCapacity Limitations: Small community organizations, volunteer-led mutual aid networks, and grassroots advocacy groups typically lack capacity for federal compliance requirements. They may have authentic community relationships that larger organizations cannot match, but authenticity does not substitute for administrative infrastructure when federal funds require it.\nFear-Based Utilization Suppression: Even well-designed programs may see limited uptake if enforcement fears suppress participation. A mobile clinic in an area with active immigration enforcement may sit empty regardless of services offered. Organizations cannot overcome population-level fear through individual outreach.\nPolitical Exclusion from RHTP Design: When state agencies design RHTP without farmworker input, resulting programs may be structurally incompatible with farmworker service delivery. Application timelines that conflict with harvest seasons, reporting requirements that demand unavailable data, and service definitions that exclude agricultural occupational health all limit participation regardless of organizational capacity.\nOrganizational Capacity Analysis The capacity question for immigrant and farmworker organizations differs from other community organization types. Professional capacity often exists, but political constraints limit its application.\nMigrant Health Centers have demonstrated capacity for federal program participation through decades of 330(g) operations. They manage complex funding streams, meet HRSA reporting requirements, and deliver quality healthcare in challenging environments. Their RHTP participation is limited less by capacity than by whether state programs include them.\nNational Technical Assistance Organizations like Migrant Clinicians Network and National Center for Farmworker Health have professional infrastructure, research capacity, and policy expertise. They can support RHTP implementation through training, resources, and advocacy but do not deliver direct services.\nCommunity Organizations have capacity that federal programs struggle to recognize. Authentic community relationships, cultural competence, and trust within immigrant populations represent capacity that professional credentials cannot provide. But this capacity does not translate easily into federal compliance requirements.\nCapacity Dimension Migrant Health Centers National TA Orgs Community Orgs Organizational stability High High Variable Financial management High High Often limited Federal compliance High High Limited Community connection Moderate to high Low High Healthcare delivery High None Limited Political navigation Moderate High Variable The capacity gap lies not in whether organizations can serve populations but in whether they can serve populations through RHTP’s specific mechanisms. Federal compliance requirements may exclude organizations with the strongest community connections while enabling organizations with the strongest administrative infrastructure.\nRHTP Participation Pathways Several models could integrate immigrant and farmworker organizations into RHTP:\nStrengthening Existing Migrant Health Infrastructure: The simplest pathway directs RHTP resources to existing Migrant Health Centers, expanding their capacity rather than creating parallel systems. States with Migrant Health Centers could designate them as RHTP subawardees for farmworker-serving activities. This approach leverages proven capacity without requiring new organizational development.\nThe 177 federally funded Migrant Health Center grantees represent existing compliance-ready infrastructure. These organizations already manage Section 330(g) grants, meet HRSA reporting requirements, and maintain the billing and clinical systems federal programs require. Adding RHTP funds to their operations requires no new organizational capacity development, only program expansion.\nStates like Texas, California, Florida, and North Carolina with substantial agricultural workforces and established Migrant Health Center networks could significantly expand farmworker health access through RHTP supplementation. The question is whether state agencies prioritize this approach.\nTechnical Assistance and Workforce Development: National TA organizations could receive RHTP funds for training promotores, developing culturally appropriate materials, and supporting state-level farmworker health initiatives. This model does not directly serve populations but builds capacity across states.\nThe Farmworker Health Network, comprising six national organizations receiving HRSA funding for training and technical assistance, could extend its reach through RHTP. Organizations like Migrant Clinicians Network, National Center for Farmworker Health, and Farmworker Justice have expertise that state agencies implementing RHTP frequently lack. Directing resources toward this intermediary function builds state capacity while avoiding direct service delivery complexity.\nPartnership Models: Community organizations without federal compliance capacity could partner with FQHCs or other compliant entities as formal subawardees. The FQHC provides fiscal and compliance infrastructure; the community organization provides community relationships and culturally appropriate outreach. Success depends on partnership equity rather than community organization subordination.\nEffective partnerships require clear role definition and equitable resource sharing. When FQHCs serve as fiscal sponsors, community organizations risk becoming contractors rather than partners. The FQHC may capture overhead while the community organization does relationship-intensive work at inadequate compensation. Successful models establish governance structures where community organizations have voice in program design and resource allocation.\nCarve-Out Funding: Some states have created farmworker-specific RHTP components that explicitly serve agricultural workers without requiring them to compete for general rural health funds. California’s RHTP application, for example, references Central Valley agricultural communities as priority populations. This approach provides political cover for inclusion while directing resources to need.\nCarve-outs acknowledge that farmworker health needs differ from general rural health needs and require dedicated attention. Competing against general rural health priorities often disadvantages farmworker proposals because review committees may not understand agricultural health contexts or may avoid politically sensitive populations. Designated funding streams remove this competitive disadvantage.\nMobile and Seasonal Service Models: Farmworker mobility requires service models that traditional fixed-site healthcare cannot provide. Mobile health units, seasonal clinic hours, and care coordination across geographic locations all address the population’s defining characteristic: movement.\nRHTP could fund mobile unit expansion for Migrant Health Centers, seasonal staffing increases during harvest periods, and care coordination systems that maintain records across locations. The Migrant Clinicians Network’s Health Network system, which tracks patient records across participating health centers nationally, exemplifies infrastructure enabling continuity for mobile populations. RHTP investment could expand such systems.\nThe Honest Assessment Immigrant and farmworker organizations have capacity to support rural health transformation where political environments permit, where existing infrastructure provides foundation, and where federal compliance requirements do not exclude authentic community partners.\nMost RHTP implementation will not include explicit farmworker provisions. Political calculations, administrative convenience, and population invisibility combine to produce programs that serve “rural residents” without naming who those residents are. Farmworkers will receive some benefit from general rural health improvements but will not be transformation’s primary beneficiaries.\nOrganizations serving invisible populations face impossible choices. Participation risks population exposure; non-participation accepts resource exclusion. Neither choice serves populations well. The structural problem is not organizational capacity but policy design that forces tradeoffs between resources and safety.\nFor RHTP to achieve its transformation mandate for all rural residents, intentional design is required:\nExplicit inclusion of farmworker provisions in state plans and subaward opportunities Designated funding streams that do not require competing against general rural health priorities Compliance accommodations that recognize mobile populations, mixed-status families, and documentation barriers Political protection for state agencies willing to serve controversial populations Measurement systems that capture farmworker outcomes without requiring individual identification Without intentional design, RHTP will transform rural health for rural residents who are politically visible while leaving invisible populations behind. That is not transformation failure; it is transformation design functioning as intended in environments where some populations do not count.\nRecommendations For Immigrant and Farmworker Organizations:\nAssess state political environment before pursuing RHTP participation Partner with FQHCs or other compliant entities when direct participation is impossible Advocate for explicit farmworker inclusion in state RHTP designs Document population needs even when programs exclude populations Build relationships with state agencies that may evolve over time For State Agencies:\nInclude farmworker populations explicitly in RHTP needs assessments Designate Migrant Health Centers as subawardees where they exist Create application processes accessible to farmworker-serving organizations Protect population data from immigration enforcement Measure transformation success by whether all rural residents benefit For Healthcare Partners:\nRecognize farmworkers as part of service populations Partner with immigrant organizations for outreach and navigation Train staff in culturally appropriate care for immigrant populations Address language access throughout systems Support Migrant Health Center integration into regional networks For CMS:\nMonitor whether RHTP reaches farmworker populations Provide guidance on serving populations regardless of immigration status Fund technical assistance specifically for farmworker health transformation Protect state agencies from political retaliation for serving all populations Evaluate transformation success by equity metrics that include invisible populations Cross-References Series 1: Understanding Rural America\n1.B: Demographics (immigrant population distribution) 1.D: Economics and Employment (agricultural labor markets) Series 2: Federal Policy Architecture\n2.C: Medicare Rural Provisions (coverage limitations) 2.D: HRSA Rural Programs (Migrant Health Center program) Series 4: Transformation Approaches\n4.D: Community Health Workers (promotora models) 4.H: Social Needs Integration (SDOH for immigrant populations) Series 8: Community Organizations\n8.D: Community Health Workers and Promotoras 8.H: Tribal and Indigenous Organizations (sovereignty parallels) Series 9: Special Populations\n9.D: Agricultural and Seasonal Workers (population analysis) Series 10: Regional Deep Dives\n10.D: Rio Grande Valley (border community context) 10.I: California Central Valley (agricultural workforce) Sources Farmworker Justice. “2024 Key Resources for Agricultural Worker Health.” Farmworker Justice, 2024, www.farmworkerjustice.org/resource/2024-key-resources-for-agricultural-worker-health/.\nFung, Wenson, et al. “Findings from the Quality of and Access to Health Care Supplement of the National Agricultural Workers Survey (NAWS) 2019-2020.” U.S. Department of Labor, May 2024.\nHealth Resources and Services Administration. “Health Center Program Compliance Manual.” HRSA, 2024, bphc.hrsa.gov/compliance/compliance-manual.\nHousing Assistance Council. “Rural Research Brief: Creating A Better Understanding of Farmworker Communities and Their Housing Conditions.” HAC, Apr. 2024.\nLiebman, Amy K., et al. “The Climate Migrant: Health Risks Before, During, and After Migration.” Journal of the National Hispanic Medical Association, vol. 2, no. 1, 2024, pp. 36-43.\nMigrant Clinicians Network. “About MCN.” Migrant Clinicians Network, 2024, www.migrantclinician.org/about.\nNational Advisory Council on Migrant Health. “Recommendations to the Secretary.” HRSA, 2024, www.hrsa.gov/advisory-committees/migrant-health.\nNational Center for Farmworker Health. “2024 Migrant Health Program: History and Legislation.” NCFH, 2024, www.ncfh.org.\nRural Health Information Hub. “Migrant and Seasonal Farmworker Health Overview.” RHIhub, 2024, www.ruralhealthinfo.org/topics/migrant-health.\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services. “Farmworker Appreciation Day Fact Sheet.” HHS, Aug. 2024, www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/farmworker-appreciation-day-fact-sheet.pdf.\nRHTP 8.I: Immigrant and Farmworker Organizations / Series 8: Community Organizations / Rural Health Transformation Project / Version 1: January 2026\n",

</div>

<p>Rural America&rsquo;s food production depends on workers who remain largely invisible in health policy. <strong>Approximately 2.4 million farmworkers</strong> harvest the nation&rsquo;s crops, process its meat, and maintain its agricultural infrastructure. An estimated 50% lack documented immigration status. The vast majority lack health insurance. They experience occupational exposures, chronic disease burdens, and mental health challenges that exceed general population rates. Yet rural health transformation frameworks routinely ignore them.</p>
<p>Immigrant and farmworker organizations serve these populations despite hostile policy environments, uncertain legal terrain, and funding constraints that make their work precarious. They navigate between population need and political sensitivity, between authentic community connection and institutional requirements that could expose the people they serve. RHTP&rsquo;s promise to transform rural health for &ldquo;all rural residents&rdquo; tests whether transformation can reach populations that politics renders invisible.</p>
<p>This article examines whether immigrant and farmworker organizations can participate in RHTP implementation, the tensions between serving marginalized populations and operating within federal frameworks, and what honest assessment reveals about transformation&rsquo;s reach. The evidence suggests that <strong>serving invisible populations requires intentional design</strong>, not generic rural health programming that ignores who actually lives and works in rural communities.</p>

<h3 id="who-farmworkers-are">Who Farmworkers Are<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#who-farmworkers-are">#</a></h3>
<p>The agricultural workforce defies easy categorization. <strong>Migratory agricultural workers</strong> follow crops across states, establishing temporary homes for seasonal employment. <strong>Seasonal agricultural workers</strong> remain in single locations but work only during growing seasons. Both populations share characteristics that distinguish them from other rural residents.</p>
<p>According to the National Agricultural Workers Survey, the farmworker population is predominantly Hispanic (83%), overwhelmingly male (69%), and relatively young (median age 41). <strong>Foreign-born workers constitute approximately 65% of the workforce</strong>, with Mexico as the primary country of origin. Educational attainment is low: median years of schooling is 9, and 26% report completing fewer than 6 years of education.</p>
<p>Income places farmworkers among the poorest workers in America. <strong>Median personal income is approximately $20,000 to $25,000 annually</strong> for those working 200+ days. Family income remains below poverty thresholds for substantial portions of the population. Work is physically demanding, frequently dangerous, and often performed in conditions that compromise health.</p>
<h3 id="immigration-status-complexity">Immigration Status Complexity<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#immigration-status-complexity">#</a></h3>
<p>Farmworker immigration status creates healthcare access barriers that legal residents do not face. Estimates suggest <strong>approximately 50% of farmworkers lack work authorization</strong>, though precise figures are impossible to obtain. Those with temporary work visas (H-2A) have limited access to public benefits. Those with documentation may still experience language barriers, mobility challenges, and fear based on family members&rsquo; status.</p>
<p>The mixed-status family is common: citizen children with undocumented parents, documented spouses with undocumented partners, extended family networks spanning legal categories. Healthcare decisions cannot be separated from immigration enforcement fears. <strong>A parent delaying care may be protecting family stability rather than exhibiting health-neglecting behavior.</strong></p>
<h3 id="health-status-and-occupational-exposure">Health Status and Occupational Exposure<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#health-status-and-occupational-exposure">#</a></h3>
<p>Farmworker health reflects occupational hazards and access limitations. <strong>Pesticide exposure</strong> causes acute illness and chronic neurological effects. Heat illness kills farmworkers at rates far exceeding other occupations. Musculoskeletal injuries from repetitive motion and heavy lifting accumulate over working years. Eye injuries, respiratory conditions from dust and chemical exposure, and skin conditions are endemic.</p>
<p>Chronic disease prevalence is high. Diabetes, hypertension, and obesity rates exceed national averages. Mental health challenges include depression, anxiety, isolation, and family separation stress. Substance use, particularly alcohol, reflects coping mechanisms for difficult conditions.</p>
<p>Access barriers compound health risks. <strong>Fewer than 20% of farmworkers have employer-provided health insurance.</strong> Medicaid eligibility is limited for undocumented workers and varies by state for documented immigrants. Language barriers, transportation challenges, work schedules that conflict with clinic hours, and fear of authorities all reduce healthcare utilization.</p>
<p>The result is a population with <strong>high health needs, low health access, and minimal visibility</strong> in the policy systems that could address their conditions.</p>
<h2 id="the-organizational-landscape">The Organizational Landscape<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-organizational-landscape">#</a></h2>
<p>Organizations serving farmworkers and immigrants have developed over decades, often operating in parallel to mainstream rural health systems rather than integrated within them.</p>
<h3 id="migrant-health-centers">Migrant Health Centers<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#migrant-health-centers">#</a></h3>
<p>The federal Migrant Health Program, authorized by the 1962 Migrant Health Act and now administered under Section 330(g) of the Public Health Service Act, provides the primary healthcare infrastructure serving farmworkers. <strong>In 2024, 177 federally funded migrant health center grantees</strong> operated across the United States. These centers served approximately <strong>1 million farmworkers and family members in 2023</strong>, representing roughly one-third of the estimated farmworker population.</p>
<p>Migrant Health Centers operate as Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) with specific mandates to serve agricultural workers. They provide culturally and linguistically appropriate primary care, preventive services, dental care, behavioral health, and pharmacy services. Many operate from both fixed and mobile sites, following harvest patterns to reach workers where they live and work. Sliding-fee scales ensure services remain affordable regardless of insurance status.</p>
<p>The FQHC designation provides financial sustainability that standalone farmworker organizations cannot achieve. <strong>Health centers receive federal operating grants and enhanced Medicaid reimbursement rates</strong>, enabling services that market economics would not support. However, Migrant Health Center coverage remains incomplete. Two-thirds of farmworkers lack access to these specialized services.</p>
<h3 id="advocacy-and-legal-service-organizations">Advocacy and Legal Service Organizations<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#advocacy-and-legal-service-organizations">#</a></h3>
<p>Beyond healthcare, organizations serve farmworkers through advocacy, legal assistance, and community organizing. <strong>Farmworker Justice</strong>, based in Washington, D.C., advocates for improved wages, working conditions, immigration policy, and health protections. The organization provides training and technical assistance to Migrant Health Centers and influences federal policy.</p>
<p><strong>Legal aid organizations</strong> across agricultural states help farmworkers navigate immigration status, workplace rights, and access to benefits. Organizations like California Rural Legal Assistance, Texas RioGrande Legal Aid, and Florida Legal Services provide representation that individual farmworkers cannot afford.</p>
<h3 id="community-based-organizations">Community-Based Organizations<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#community-based-organizations">#</a></h3>
<p>Immigrant-serving community organizations operate at local levels, often with minimal budgets and volunteer leadership. <strong>Churches, mutual aid networks, and hometown associations</strong> provide social support, emergency assistance, and connection to services. These organizations have authentic community relationships that larger institutions cannot replicate.</p>
<p><strong>Promotores de salud</strong> (community health workers) programs embed health outreach within immigrant communities. Promotores share language, culture, and lived experience with the populations they serve. Programs like <strong>MHP Salud</strong> train and deploy promotores in farmworker and border communities across multiple states.</p>

<p>The landscape reveals <strong>significant variation in organizational capacity</strong>. National technical assistance organizations have professional infrastructure but do not deliver direct services. FQHCs have healthcare delivery capacity but face enrollment and reach limitations. Community organizations have authentic relationships but often lack capacity for formal program participation.</p>

<h3 id="tension-1-serving-marginalized-populations-within-hostile-policy-environments">Tension 1: Serving Marginalized Populations Within Hostile Policy Environments<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#tension-1-serving-marginalized-populations-within-hostile-policy-environments">#</a></h3>
<p>Immigrant and farmworker organizations exist in policy environments that often work against their populations. Immigration enforcement creates fear that suppresses healthcare utilization. State policies in many agricultural states restrict immigrant access to public benefits. Political rhetoric frames immigrants as threats rather than essential workers.</p>
<p><strong>The Hostile Environment Reality:</strong> Organizations serving farmworkers operate under conditions that healthcare providers serving other populations do not face. A health outreach program that collects personal information may deter participation if workers fear data could be shared with immigration authorities. A clinic located near an ICE enforcement area may see utilization drop regardless of actual enforcement actions. <strong>Fear is a public health barrier that policy creates.</strong></p>
<p>Federal funds come with federal oversight. Organizations accepting RHTP subawards must comply with reporting requirements, demographic data collection, and program monitoring that could expose the populations they serve. The tension between serving invisible populations and participating in visible federal programs is not theoretical.</p>
<p><strong>The Service Imperative View:</strong> Farmworkers need healthcare regardless of political environment. Organizations that refuse federal funding to protect population invisibility abandon populations to worse outcomes. Participation in federal programs, even imperfect ones, brings resources that communities need. <strong>Strategic engagement serves communities better than principled withdrawal.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Assessment:</strong> Both perspectives have validity. The hostile environment is real, and participation risks are genuine. But absence from federal programs also has costs. Effective organizations navigate this tension through <strong>careful program design, community trust building, and explicit protections</strong> that reduce risk while capturing resources. Organizations that cannot navigate this tension may protect populations from federal visibility while leaving health needs unaddressed.</p>
<h3 id="tension-2-rhtps-all-rural-residents-promise-vs-political-reality">Tension 2: RHTP&rsquo;s &ldquo;All Rural Residents&rdquo; Promise vs. Political Reality<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#tension-2-rhtps-all-rural-residents-promise-vs-political-reality">#</a></h3>
<p>RHTP&rsquo;s statutory mandate applies to rural health transformation without distinguishing populations by immigration status. The program aims to serve &ldquo;rural residents&rdquo; comprehensively. But political sensitivity around immigrant populations affects how states design programs and select subawardees.</p>
<p><strong>The Universality Promise:</strong> Federal law authorizes serving rural populations. RHTP funding should reach all rural residents, including farmworkers and immigrants who live, work, and contribute to rural communities. <strong>Excluding essential workers from essential health programs contradicts transformation logic.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Political Reality:</strong> State agencies implement RHTP. In states with anti-immigrant political environments, explicitly including farmworker services may generate controversy that threatens the entire program. State officials may avoid farmworker-specific language not from hostility but from political calculation about program survival.</p>
<p><strong>The Invisibility Result:</strong> When RHTP implementation documents describe &ldquo;rural residents&rdquo; without mentioning farmworkers, immigrant health organizations may not apply for subawards. When workforce initiatives describe &ldquo;community health workers&rdquo; without referencing promotores, culturally appropriate models may not receive support. <strong>Invisibility in program design produces invisibility in program implementation.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Assessment:</strong> The gap between federal authorization and state implementation represents transformation failure. States serving agricultural populations cannot achieve rural health transformation while ignoring agricultural workers. But organizations serving farmworkers bear costs for making this argument publicly. <strong>Advocacy for inclusion risks retaliation; silence accepts exclusion.</strong></p>
<h3 id="vignette-navigating-federal-funding-in-hostile-territory">Vignette: Navigating Federal Funding in Hostile Territory<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#vignette-navigating-federal-funding-in-hostile-territory">#</a></h3>
<p>The Valley Farmworker Health Coalition has served migrant workers across three agricultural counties for 25 years. Operating through a network of mobile clinics, promotores, and partnerships with growers, the organization reached 8,000 workers annually with immunizations, chronic disease management, and prenatal care. Funding came through a mix of HRSA grants, foundation support, and modest grower contributions.</p>
<p>When the state announced RHTP subaward opportunities, the Coalition saw potential to expand services. The application requested $1.2 million over three years for additional mobile units, expanded promotora programs, and behavioral health integration. The proposal detailed farmworker health needs with data the state rarely saw.</p>
<p>The state review committee praised the application&rsquo;s quality but hesitated over its population focus. &ldquo;Serving farmworkers is appropriate,&rdquo; one reviewer noted, &ldquo;but is it appropriate to highlight in a state program?&rdquo; The committee asked whether the application could be reframed around &ldquo;agricultural communities&rdquo; without explicit farmworker focus.</p>
<p>Coalition leadership faced a choice. Reframing would secure funding but obscure the population being served. Maintaining explicit farmworker focus might lose funding entirely. Staff worried that accepting obscured framing would set precedent for invisibility in state programs.</p>
<p>The Coalition chose explicit framing and received a reduced award focused on &ldquo;rural health outreach&rdquo; without farmworker-specific language. Mobile units would serve farmworker communities but report outcomes as general rural health. Promotores would be funded as &ldquo;community health workers&rdquo; without cultural specificity.</p>
<p>Coalition leadership felt compromised. They had secured resources but accepted framing that made their population invisible in official programs. &ldquo;We help the people we serve,&rdquo; the Executive Director reflected, &ldquo;but we also let the state pretend they don&rsquo;t exist.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="alternative-perspective-the-invisibility-critique">Alternative Perspective: The Invisibility Critique<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#alternative-perspective-the-invisibility-critique">#</a></h2>
<p>Rural health policy routinely ignores populations without political power. Farmworkers harvest food that feeds the nation but cannot vote, cannot donate to campaigns, and fear visibility that might invite enforcement attention. <strong>Economically essential but politically invisible, farmworkers reveal transformation&rsquo;s limits.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Critique&rsquo;s Core Argument:</strong> RHTP that does not explicitly include farmworker provisions fails transformation&rsquo;s equity claims. Generic &ldquo;rural health&rdquo; programming that avoids naming farmworkers accepts their exclusion by default. If transformation serves only populations with political voice, it is not transformation but maintenance of existing hierarchies with new funding.</p>
<p><strong>Evidence Supporting the Critique:</strong> Analysis of RHTP state applications reveals minimal explicit farmworker provisions outside states with established Migrant Health infrastructure. When applications mention &ldquo;agricultural communities,&rdquo; they often reference farmers and ranchers rather than workers. <strong>Who counts as a rural resident shapes who receives transformation benefits.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Counter-Argument:</strong> States cannot transform systems they do not control. Immigration policy is federal. Labor law enforcement is inconsistent. State health agencies serving farmworkers cannot solve problems created by federal immigration policy and employer practices. Targeting limited transformation resources toward populations states can actually serve may produce better outcomes than symbolic inclusion that delivers little.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment:</strong> The invisibility critique has <strong>substantial validity</strong>. Rural health transformation that excludes essential workers is incomplete transformation. But the critique does not provide implementation guidance for organizations navigating hostile environments. Visibility has costs that populations, not critics, bear. The tension between naming populations and protecting them is genuine.</p>
<h2 id="when-immigrantfarmworker-organizations-can-support-transformation">When Immigrant/Farmworker Organizations Can Support Transformation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#when-immigrantfarmworker-organizations-can-support-transformation">#</a></h2>
<p>Conditions enabling effective participation exist in some contexts:</p>
<p><strong>Supportive State Policy Environments:</strong> States with immigrant-inclusive policies, Medicaid expansion covering qualifying immigrants, and political cultures that value farmworker contributions create space for explicit program participation. <strong>California, Oregon, Washington, and other states with established farmworker health infrastructure</strong> demonstrate how inclusion can work.</p>
<p><strong>Established Migrant Health Infrastructure:</strong> Where Migrant Health Centers already operate, RHTP can strengthen existing programs rather than creating new ones. The FQHC platform provides compliance capacity, billing infrastructure, and community relationships that support expanded services. RHTP subawards can supplement 330(g) funding without requiring new organizational development.</p>
<p><strong>Healthcare Partners Committed to Comprehensive Service:</strong> When hospitals, health systems, and other RHTP participants view farmworkers as part of their service population, immigrant organizations can participate as partners rather than isolated advocates. <strong>Integration into broader transformation coalitions</strong> protects farmworker services from political isolation.</p>
<p><strong>Organizational Capacity for Federal Compliance:</strong> Organizations with professional financial management, reporting systems, and compliance infrastructure can accept federal funds without administrative crisis. This typically means FQHCs, larger nonprofits with government contract experience, or organizations partnering with fiscal sponsors that provide compliance support.</p>
<h2 id="when-immigrantfarmworker-organizations-cannot-support-transformation">When Immigrant/Farmworker Organizations Cannot Support Transformation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#when-immigrantfarmworker-organizations-cannot-support-transformation">#</a></h2>
<p>Conditions limiting participation are widespread:</p>
<p><strong>Hostile State Policy Environments:</strong> States with anti-immigrant political climates, enforcement cooperation agreements, and restricted benefit access create environments where explicit farmworker program participation is impossible. Organizations may continue serving populations but cannot participate visibly in state-administered programs without endangering those they serve.</p>
<p><strong>Capacity Limitations:</strong> Small community organizations, volunteer-led mutual aid networks, and grassroots advocacy groups typically lack capacity for federal compliance requirements. They may have authentic community relationships that larger organizations cannot match, but <strong>authenticity does not substitute for administrative infrastructure</strong> when federal funds require it.</p>
<p><strong>Fear-Based Utilization Suppression:</strong> Even well-designed programs may see limited uptake if enforcement fears suppress participation. A mobile clinic in an area with active immigration enforcement may sit empty regardless of services offered. Organizations cannot overcome population-level fear through individual outreach.</p>
<p><strong>Political Exclusion from RHTP Design:</strong> When state agencies design RHTP without farmworker input, resulting programs may be structurally incompatible with farmworker service delivery. Application timelines that conflict with harvest seasons, reporting requirements that demand unavailable data, and service definitions that exclude agricultural occupational health all limit participation regardless of organizational capacity.</p>
<h2 id="organizational-capacity-analysis">Organizational Capacity Analysis<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#organizational-capacity-analysis">#</a></h2>
<p>The capacity question for immigrant and farmworker organizations differs from other community organization types. <strong>Professional capacity often exists, but political constraints limit its application.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Migrant Health Centers</strong> have demonstrated capacity for federal program participation through decades of 330(g) operations. They manage complex funding streams, meet HRSA reporting requirements, and deliver quality healthcare in challenging environments. Their RHTP participation is limited less by capacity than by whether state programs include them.</p>
<p><strong>National Technical Assistance Organizations</strong> like Migrant Clinicians Network and National Center for Farmworker Health have professional infrastructure, research capacity, and policy expertise. They can support RHTP implementation through training, resources, and advocacy but do not deliver direct services.</p>
<p><strong>Community Organizations</strong> have capacity that federal programs struggle to recognize. Authentic community relationships, cultural competence, and trust within immigrant populations represent capacity that professional credentials cannot provide. But this capacity does not translate easily into federal compliance requirements.</p>

<p>The capacity gap lies not in whether organizations can serve populations but in whether they can serve populations through RHTP&rsquo;s specific mechanisms. <strong>Federal compliance requirements may exclude organizations with the strongest community connections while enabling organizations with the strongest administrative infrastructure.</strong></p>
<h2 id="rhtp-participation-pathways">RHTP Participation Pathways<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#rhtp-participation-pathways">#</a></h2>
<p>Several models could integrate immigrant and farmworker organizations into RHTP:</p>
<p><strong>Strengthening Existing Migrant Health Infrastructure:</strong> The simplest pathway directs RHTP resources to existing Migrant Health Centers, expanding their capacity rather than creating parallel systems. States with Migrant Health Centers could designate them as RHTP subawardees for farmworker-serving activities. This approach leverages proven capacity without requiring new organizational development.</p>
<p>The 177 federally funded Migrant Health Center grantees represent <strong>existing compliance-ready infrastructure</strong>. These organizations already manage Section 330(g) grants, meet HRSA reporting requirements, and maintain the billing and clinical systems federal programs require. Adding RHTP funds to their operations requires no new organizational capacity development, only program expansion.</p>
<p>States like Texas, California, Florida, and North Carolina with substantial agricultural workforces and established Migrant Health Center networks could significantly expand farmworker health access through RHTP supplementation. The question is whether state agencies prioritize this approach.</p>
<p><strong>Technical Assistance and Workforce Development:</strong> National TA organizations could receive RHTP funds for training promotores, developing culturally appropriate materials, and supporting state-level farmworker health initiatives. This model does not directly serve populations but builds capacity across states.</p>
<p>The <strong>Farmworker Health Network</strong>, comprising six national organizations receiving HRSA funding for training and technical assistance, could extend its reach through RHTP. Organizations like Migrant Clinicians Network, National Center for Farmworker Health, and Farmworker Justice have expertise that state agencies implementing RHTP frequently lack. Directing resources toward this intermediary function builds state capacity while avoiding direct service delivery complexity.</p>
<p><strong>Partnership Models:</strong> Community organizations without federal compliance capacity could partner with FQHCs or other compliant entities as formal subawardees. The FQHC provides fiscal and compliance infrastructure; the community organization provides community relationships and culturally appropriate outreach. Success depends on partnership equity rather than community organization subordination.</p>
<p>Effective partnerships require <strong>clear role definition and equitable resource sharing</strong>. When FQHCs serve as fiscal sponsors, community organizations risk becoming contractors rather than partners. The FQHC may capture overhead while the community organization does relationship-intensive work at inadequate compensation. Successful models establish governance structures where community organizations have voice in program design and resource allocation.</p>
<p><strong>Carve-Out Funding:</strong> Some states have created farmworker-specific RHTP components that explicitly serve agricultural workers without requiring them to compete for general rural health funds. California&rsquo;s RHTP application, for example, references Central Valley agricultural communities as priority populations. This approach provides political cover for inclusion while directing resources to need.</p>
<p>Carve-outs acknowledge that <strong>farmworker health needs differ from general rural health needs</strong> and require dedicated attention. Competing against general rural health priorities often disadvantages farmworker proposals because review committees may not understand agricultural health contexts or may avoid politically sensitive populations. Designated funding streams remove this competitive disadvantage.</p>
<p><strong>Mobile and Seasonal Service Models:</strong> Farmworker mobility requires service models that traditional fixed-site healthcare cannot provide. Mobile health units, seasonal clinic hours, and care coordination across geographic locations all address the population&rsquo;s defining characteristic: movement.</p>
<p>RHTP could fund <strong>mobile unit expansion</strong> for Migrant Health Centers, seasonal staffing increases during harvest periods, and care coordination systems that maintain records across locations. The Migrant Clinicians Network&rsquo;s Health Network system, which tracks patient records across participating health centers nationally, exemplifies infrastructure enabling continuity for mobile populations. RHTP investment could expand such systems.</p>
<h2 id="the-honest-assessment">The Honest Assessment<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-honest-assessment">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Immigrant and farmworker organizations have capacity to support rural health transformation</strong> where political environments permit, where existing infrastructure provides foundation, and where federal compliance requirements do not exclude authentic community partners.</p>
<p><strong>Most RHTP implementation will not include explicit farmworker provisions.</strong> Political calculations, administrative convenience, and population invisibility combine to produce programs that serve &ldquo;rural residents&rdquo; without naming who those residents are. Farmworkers will receive some benefit from general rural health improvements but will not be transformation&rsquo;s primary beneficiaries.</p>
<p><strong>Organizations serving invisible populations face impossible choices.</strong> Participation risks population exposure; non-participation accepts resource exclusion. Neither choice serves populations well. The structural problem is not organizational capacity but <strong>policy design that forces tradeoffs between resources and safety</strong>.</p>
<p>For RHTP to achieve its transformation mandate for all rural residents, <strong>intentional design is required</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Explicit inclusion of farmworker provisions</strong> in state plans and subaward opportunities</li>
<li><strong>Designated funding streams</strong> that do not require competing against general rural health priorities</li>
<li><strong>Compliance accommodations</strong> that recognize mobile populations, mixed-status families, and documentation barriers</li>
<li><strong>Political protection</strong> for state agencies willing to serve controversial populations</li>
<li><strong>Measurement systems</strong> that capture farmworker outcomes without requiring individual identification</li>
</ol>
<p>Without intentional design, RHTP will transform rural health for rural residents who are politically visible while leaving invisible populations behind. That is not transformation failure; it is transformation design functioning as intended in environments where some populations do not count.</p>
<h2 id="recommendations">Recommendations<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#recommendations">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>For Immigrant and Farmworker Organizations:</strong></p>

<li>Document population needs even when programs exclude populations</li>
<li>Build relationships with state agencies that may evolve over time</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For State Agencies:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Include farmworker populations explicitly in RHTP needs assessments</li>
<li>Designate Migrant Health Centers as subawardees where they exist</li>
<li>Create application processes accessible to farmworker-serving organizations</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>For Healthcare Partners:</strong></p>
<ul>
