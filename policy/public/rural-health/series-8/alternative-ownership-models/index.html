  "articleBody": "Healthcare cooperatives, worker-owned agencies, community land trusts, and social enterprises promise to align ownership structure with community benefit. The theory is compelling: who owns determines who decides, and who decides determines whether communities thrive or decline. External owners extract value; community owners reinvest it. External owners make portfolio decisions from distant headquarters; community owners make decisions reflecting local priorities. The promise is structural transformation, not incremental service improvement.\nThe promise exceeds proven capacity. Alternative ownership models remain marginal in American healthcare. The most successful examples serve millions but required decades to build. Recent attempts to create healthcare cooperatives collapsed spectacularly: 20 of 23 ACA CO-OPs failed within three years. Worker-owned healthcare cooperatives exist and demonstrate compelling outcomes, but they are small, concentrated in specific sectors, and difficult to replicate. Community land trusts for health facilities barely exist at all.\nThis article assesses whether alternative ownership models offer genuine transformation potential or remain inspiring exceptions that cannot scale. The evidence suggests both: models exist that work, but the conditions enabling success are demanding, and failure is common. RHTP cannot assume alternative ownership offers ready solutions. It can support promising models while honestly assessing what it takes to succeed.\nThe Alternative Ownership Landscape Alternative ownership in healthcare takes multiple forms, each with distinct characteristics, scale, and evidence base.\nHealthcare Cooperatives are member-owned insurance and delivery organizations. Members hold ownership stakes, elect governance, and share in organizational surpluses. The United States has perhaps 50 healthcare cooperatives with meaningful scale, though definitions vary. Most are regional insurance plans; some integrate insurance with care delivery.\nWorker-Owned Cooperatives give employees ownership stakes and governance voice. In healthcare, worker cooperatives concentrate in home care and direct care services. The sector includes perhaps 20 to 30 organizations with meaningful scale, plus numerous small worker cooperatives in dental, behavioral health, and primary care.\nCommunity Land Trusts separate land ownership from facility operation. The trust owns land permanently; healthcare organizations lease facilities. This structure prevents facility sale and closure while allowing operational flexibility. Healthcare-specific community land trusts are extremely rare, perhaps fewer than 10 nationally, most in planning stages rather than operation.\nSocial Enterprises blend mission and market. Healthcare social enterprises generate revenue through services while pursuing social goals. The category is broad and definitionally contested. Thousands of organizations might qualify, but few have healthcare as primary mission.\nModel Estimated Count Scale Range Strongest Evidence Primary Challenge Healthcare cooperatives ~50 Large to small HealthPartners, Group Health history Capital, governance Worker cooperatives (health) ~20-30 Small to medium CHCA, ICA Group Replication difficulty Community land trusts (health) \u003c10 Small, emerging Limited Newness, complexity Social enterprises (health) Thousands (broadly defined) Varies Sector-dependent Definition, sustainability Healthcare Cooperatives: Success and Failure The healthcare cooperative story includes both the most successful and most catastrophic examples of alternative ownership in American healthcare.\nThe Success Stories HealthPartners in Minnesota is the largest consumer-governed nonprofit health organization in the United States, serving 1.8 million members with both insurance and care delivery. Founded in 1957 after two decades of advocacy to change Minnesota law prohibiting cooperative medicine, HealthPartners grew through mergers, including with Park Nicollet Health Services, Regions Hospital, and multiple regional clinics. HealthPartners owns hospitals, employs physicians, and operates one of the nation’s largest health research foundations.\nHealthPartners demonstrates that cooperative healthcare can achieve scale and quality. The organization has received CMS Health Equity Awards and IBM Watson Health recognition as a top 15 health system. Member governance influences strategy. Surpluses reinvest in services rather than flowing to shareholders.\nGroup Health Cooperative of Washington State served over 600,000 members from its 1947 founding until Kaiser Permanente acquired it in 2017. For decades, Group Health operated as a consumer-governed integrated delivery system: members owned the plan, elected the board, and received care through Group Health facilities. The organization pioneered patient-centered medical homes and achieved outcomes that outperformed regional competitors.\nGroup Health’s sale to Kaiser raises questions about cooperative sustainability. The board approved the acquisition, citing benefits for members. Critics argued the sale represented failure of the cooperative model: after 70 years, the organization could not remain independent. Supporters countered that members received value through the transition. The acquisition illustrates cooperative governance working as designed (member representatives making decisions) while raising questions about long-term viability.\nGroup Health Cooperative of South Central Wisconsin continues operating independently, serving over 80,000 members in the Madison area. Founded over 40 years ago, GHC-SCW operates as a member-owned HMO with its own clinics. The organization demonstrates that regional healthcare cooperatives can survive and compete with commercial insurers.\nThe ACA CO-OP Catastrophe The Affordable Care Act created Consumer Operated and Oriented Plans (CO-OPs) as an alternative to the public option that progressive Democrats had sought. The program provided $2.4 billion in federal loans to establish 23 new nonprofit, consumer-governed health insurance cooperatives beginning in 2014.\nTwenty of 23 CO-OPs failed within four years. By 2020, only three remained: Community Health Options in Maine, Mountain Health CO-OP in Montana (also serving Idaho and Wyoming), and Common Ground Healthcare Cooperative in Wisconsin. The collapse affected over 700,000 enrollees who lost coverage and had to find new plans.\nThe failure had multiple causes:\nInadequate capitalization. CO-OPs received loans, not grants, and were prohibited from spending loan funds on marketing. Startup insurers competing against established carriers with decades of reserves and market presence were structurally disadvantaged.\nRisk corridor payment failure. The ACA included risk corridor provisions to stabilize new insurers by transferring funds from profitable plans to those with losses. Political opposition led to budget neutrality requirements, and payments in 2014-2016 delivered only 12.6% of requested amounts. CO-OPs that had priced premiums assuming risk corridor support faced catastrophic losses.\nManagement inexperience. ACA provisions prohibited anyone affiliated with existing insurers from serving on CO-OP boards. This excluded the people with actual experience running health insurance companies. CO-OPs were led by mission-driven founders who often lacked operational expertise.\nAdverse selection. CO-OPs that priced aggressively to gain market share attracted higher-risk enrollees. Lower premiums drew sicker populations, creating losses that required premium increases, which drove away healthier members, accelerating the death spiral.\nThe surviving CO-OPs share characteristics: conservative pricing, geographic focus, strong management, and good fortune. Community Health Options in Maine had early profitability that provided cushion for later losses. Common Ground received a $30 million lifeline loan from an anonymous source in 2016. Mountain Health operates in low-population states with limited competition.\nThe CO-OP experience demonstrates that cooperative governance does not guarantee success. Consumer ownership did not prevent catastrophic failure. Democratic governance did not produce better decisions than commercial insurer governance. The structural advantages cooperatives supposedly offer did not materialize at scale under real-world conditions.\nWhat the Evidence Shows Healthcare cooperatives can work. HealthPartners proves that a consumer-governed organization can achieve major scale and excellent outcomes. But HealthPartners took 60 years to reach current size, growing through careful expansion and strategic mergers during a period when healthcare markets were less concentrated and competitive.\nCreating new healthcare cooperatives in the current environment is extremely difficult. The ACA CO-OP program represented the largest-ever federal investment in cooperative healthcare development. Its failure rate exceeded 85%. The three survivors serve perhaps 130,000 people combined, from $2.4 billion in federal loans.\nCooperative governance provides no magic. Democratic decision-making by members does not guarantee financial viability, operational excellence, or better outcomes. What cooperatives offer is alignment: member interests and organizational interests coincide because members own the organization. That alignment matters, but it is not sufficient for success.\nWorker-Owned Healthcare: The CHCA Model Cooperative Home Care Associates (CHCA) in the Bronx is the largest worker-owned cooperative in the United States, with over 2,000 employees, nearly all Latina and African American women. Founded in 1985 with 12 home health aides, CHCA provides home care services while demonstrating that worker ownership can transform one of healthcare’s lowest-wage sectors.\nHow Worker Ownership Works CHCA employees can purchase ownership stakes for $1,000, paid through modest weekly payroll deductions of $3.65. Worker-owners receive annual dividends based on profitability, vote in elections for 8 of 13 board seats, and participate in governance. The cooperative structure creates direct connection between worker effort and organizational success.\nThe ownership model produces measurable outcomes:\nHigher wages. CHCA pays above market rates for home health aides and provides guaranteed hours for senior workers. The “Guaranteed Hours Program” ensures minimum 30 hours weekly for aides with three years of service.\nBetter retention. Home care experiences chronic turnover exceeding 60% annually industry-wide. CHCA retention significantly exceeds industry averages. Workers with ownership stakes and career pathways stay longer.\nTraining investment. CHCA’s training program provides 150 hours of instruction, double the 75 hours required by regulation. The cooperative can invest in training because it captures returns through reduced turnover.\nQuality outcomes. CHCA earned B Corp certification in 2012, the first home care company certified. Its B Impact score of 128.2 far exceeds the median business score of 50.9.\nWhy Replication Is Difficult CHCA’s success has inspired replication efforts across the country. Results are mixed. Worker cooperatives in home care have formed in Wisconsin, Washington, California, and elsewhere. Most remain small. None approaches CHCA’s scale.\nReplication challenges include:\nStartup capital. Cooperatives need capital to launch, but worker-owners typically cannot contribute substantial investment. CHCA benefited from foundation support and nonprofit partnerships during early growth. Replicating these conditions elsewhere is difficult.\nManagement expertise. Cooperative governance requires skilled management that can work within democratic structures. CHCA developed management capacity over decades. New cooperatives must find or develop such leadership.\nMarket context. CHCA operates in New York City, with large Medicaid-funded home care demand and a population willing to work in home care. Rural areas have smaller markets and different labor pools.\nRegulatory navigation. Home care regulation varies by state. Cooperative structures must fit within licensing, reimbursement, and workforce requirements that were not designed with cooperatives in mind.\nThe ICA Group, a cooperative development organization, has supported healthcare worker cooperative formation for decades. Their experience shows that success requires sustained technical assistance, patient capital, and realistic timelines. Worker cooperatives are not quick solutions. They require years to build.\nA rural community attempting to create a worker-owned cooperative for home care or other health services faces a 5 to 10 year development process, assuming everything goes well. RHTP’s five-year funding window does not match cooperative development timelines.\nCommunity Land Trusts: The Unexplored Frontier Community land trusts (CLTs) separate land ownership from what sits on the land. The trust owns property permanently; users lease it long-term. This structure has transformed affordable housing in hundreds of communities. Application to healthcare remains largely theoretical.\nThe Concept A healthcare community land trust would own the land beneath healthcare facilities. Hospitals, clinics, or nursing homes would lease from the trust. The structure would:\nPrevent facility closure through sale. When health systems sell facilities, buyers may close them. If the community owns the land, closure requires community consent.\nRetain community control. Land trust governance typically includes community representation. Healthcare decisions affecting the community would involve community voice.\nCapture land value. Healthcare facilities can appreciate substantially. Community land ownership keeps appreciation value in the community rather than flowing to facility owners.\nWhy It Barely Exists Community land trusts for healthcare face obstacles that housing CLTs do not:\nHealthcare complexity. Running a hospital requires licensure, credentialing, regulatory compliance, and operational expertise that housing management does not. Land trusts cannot operate healthcare facilities; they need operational partners. Finding qualified operators willing to work within land trust structures is difficult.\nCapital requirements. Acquiring healthcare facility land requires substantial capital. Housing CLTs often acquire individual parcels or small buildings. Hospital campuses involve millions in land value.\nTiming mismatch. CLTs typically acquire land when property values are low or through donation. Healthcare facility land becomes available when facilities close or systems divest, often under time pressure that CLT acquisition processes cannot meet.\nLimited precedent. Housing CLTs can learn from hundreds of existing models. Healthcare CLTs have essentially no models to follow. Each attempt requires reinventing basic structures.\nScattered attempts exist. Community health centers have explored CLT structures for their facilities. At least one dental clinic operates on community land trust property. Rural communities facing hospital closure have discussed CLT acquisition. None has produced a mature, replicable model.\nThe promise remains theoretical. Community land ownership of healthcare infrastructure makes conceptual sense. Practical application at scale does not yet exist. RHTP cannot fund proven CLT models because proven models do not exist.\nThe Failed Cooperative Attempt Mineral County, population 3,100, lost its only hospital in 2019. The 25-bed critical access hospital had operated for 60 years before its owner, a regional health system, determined it was no longer financially viable. The system offered the facility to the county, which lacked resources to operate it.\nA group of community leaders proposed a cooperative model. Community members would purchase shares, elect a board, and hire management to reopen the facility as a community-owned hospital. The proposal inspired widespread enthusiasm. Over 200 residents attended the initial meeting. Local media covered the effort extensively.\nReality proved more difficult than inspiration. The cooperative needed $3 million in member shares to have any chance of viability. Mineral County’s median household income was $38,000. Even at $500 per share, reaching $3 million required 6,000 shares from a population of 3,100. The math did not work.\nRegulatory requirements compounded financial challenges. Reopening required state hospital licensure, CMS certification, physician credentialing, and compliance infrastructure. The cooperative lacked anyone with hospital administration experience. Consultants estimated $500,000 in professional services just to navigate regulatory requirements.\nTwenty-seven months after the hospital closed, the cooperative effort ended. The building remains empty. Residents drive 45 minutes to the nearest hospital. The community learned that enthusiasm cannot substitute for capital, and local ownership cannot overcome structural healthcare economics.\nThe failure illustrates alternative ownership’s core limitation: community capacity rarely matches community need.\nAlternative Perspective: The Ownership Structure Promise The argument for alternative ownership has genuine force, even if implementation is difficult.\nOwnership determines incentives. Investor-owned healthcare organizations respond to shareholder demands for returns. Nonprofit organizations respond to board interests that may not align with community needs. Community-owned organizations respond to community interests because communities own them.\nValue stays local. When HealthPartners generates surplus, that surplus reinvests in services for Minnesota communities. When investor-owned health systems generate profit, that profit flows to shareholders who may live anywhere. The difference compounds over decades.\nClosure requires community consent. External owners close facilities based on portfolio strategy. Community owners must convince the community that closure serves community interest. This higher bar prevents closures that serve owners but harm communities.\nWorkers with stakes work differently. CHCA demonstrates that worker-owners provide better care, stay longer, and build organizational capacity that benefits clients. The ownership connection is real, not rhetorical.\nAssessment: The ownership structure argument is correct in theory. Ownership matters. Incentives matter. Community ownership aligns incentives with community benefit in ways external ownership cannot. But the argument’s validity does not mean alternative ownership is achievable. Structural advantages mean nothing if the structure cannot be built. The question is not whether community ownership would be better, but whether community ownership is possible given available resources, capacity, and timeframes.\nCapacity Assessment: Alternative Ownership Organizations Organization Type Location Staff/Members Revenue Healthcare Role Capacity Assessment HealthPartners Consumer cooperative MN, WI 26,000 employees, 1.8M members ~$8 billion Integrated insurance and delivery High: proven model, major scale Group Health SCW Consumer cooperative WI (Madison) ~500 employees, 80,000 members ~$300 million Insurance and clinics High: stable, regional focus Mountain Health CO-OP Insurance cooperative MT, ID, WY ~50 employees, 30,000 members ~$100 million Insurance only Moderate: surviving but small Common Ground Insurance cooperative WI (eastern) ~100 employees, 54,000 members ~$200 million Insurance only Moderate: growing after crisis Community Health Options Insurance cooperative ME ~200 employees, 25,000 members ~$150 million Insurance only Moderate: profitable but shrinking market CHCA Worker cooperative NY (Bronx) 2,000+ worker-owners ~$80 million Home care services High: largest worker coop, proven outcomes Cooperative Care Worker cooperative WI (central) ~200 workers ~$5 million Home care services Moderate: regional, growing Various dental coops Worker cooperatives Multiple 5-50 each \u003c$5M each Dental services Low to moderate: small, scattered When Alternative Ownership Can Support Transformation Alternative ownership succeeds when specific conditions exist:\nExisting model to build on. HealthPartners grew from Group Health’s foundation. CHCA inspired replication efforts with proven operational models. Creating entirely new models requires capabilities most communities lack.\nAdequate capitalization. The ACA CO-OPs failed largely because they were undercapitalized from the start. Worker cooperatives need patient capital during multi-year development. Community land trusts require acquisition funds. Without capital, alternative ownership cannot launch.\nManagement expertise. Democratic governance does not eliminate need for professional management. Cooperatives that succeed have skilled executives who can work within democratic structures. Finding such leaders, especially in rural areas, is difficult.\nRealistic timelines. Healthcare cooperatives take decades to achieve scale. Worker cooperatives take years to stabilize. RHTP’s five-year window does not match these development timelines. Communities expecting quick results will be disappointed.\nSupportive policy environment. Healthcare regulation assumes conventional ownership structures. Cooperatives must navigate licensure, reimbursement, and compliance requirements designed for investor-owned or nonprofit organizations. States with cooperative-friendly policies offer better environments.\nWhen Alternative Ownership Cannot Support Transformation Alternative ownership fails when conditions preclude success:\nCommunity capacity insufficient. The Mineral County cooperative failed because community resources could not support the capital requirements. Communities lacking wealth, expertise, or organizational capacity cannot build alternative ownership structures regardless of desire.\nNo model to adapt. Community land trusts for healthcare have essentially no proven models. Communities cannot adopt what does not exist. Pioneering new models requires resources and risk tolerance that RHTP cannot reasonably expect.\nTimeline mismatch. RHTP needs transformation within five years. Cooperative development requires longer. Funding alternative ownership development that cannot produce results within program timeframes wastes resources.\nMarket conditions hostile. Cooperatives in highly competitive, consolidated markets face structural disadvantages. Most ACA CO-OPs failed partly because they competed against established commercial insurers with massive scale advantages. Rural markets with limited competition may be more favorable.\nRecommendations For Alternative Ownership Advocates\nStop overpromising. Alternative ownership is difficult, failure is common, and success requires conditions that rarely exist. Advocates who claim alternative ownership can solve rural healthcare crises set communities up for disappointment. Honest assessment of what alternative ownership requires serves communities better than inspirational rhetoric.\nBuild the evidence base. The strongest argument for alternative ownership would be demonstrated success at scale. Invest in documenting what works, identifying success factors, and creating replicable models. Until evidence accumulates, alternative ownership remains promising hypothesis rather than proven solution.\nDevelop technical assistance capacity. Communities cannot build alternative ownership alone. The ICA Group, cooperative development organizations, and technical assistance providers are essential. Investment in TA capacity produces more alternative ownership success than investment in individual community attempts.\nFor State Agencies\nDo not assume alternative ownership offers ready solutions. The evidence base is thin. Success is rare. Failure is common. States that allocate significant RHTP resources to alternative ownership development are betting on approaches without proven track records.\nSupport proven models where they exist. HealthPartners-style consumer cooperatives work. CHCA-style worker cooperatives work. Supporting expansion of proven models offers better odds than funding new model development.\nAllow realistic timelines. If alternative ownership development proceeds, recognize that meaningful results require years beyond RHTP’s five-year window. Fund development knowing that transformation will occur after program ends, if at all.\nFor CMS\nDo not require alternative ownership as transformation strategy. The evidence does not support alternative ownership as general solution. Communities that want to pursue alternative ownership should be able to, but RHTP should not push communities toward approaches with high failure rates.\nLearn from the CO-OP disaster. The ACA CO-OP program represented the largest federal investment in cooperative healthcare ever attempted. It failed catastrophically. Any future federal support for healthcare cooperatives should incorporate lessons from that failure: adequate capitalization, realistic expectations, experienced management, and time horizons matching development needs.\nFor Communities\nAssess capacity honestly before attempting alternative ownership. Enthusiasm is not enough. Capital, expertise, management, and time are required. Communities lacking these resources should not pursue alternative ownership regardless of its appeal.\nLearn from failure. The Mineral County cooperative attempt failed, but the community learned what alternative ownership actually requires. Communities considering alternative ownership should study failures as carefully as successes.\nConsider alternatives to ownership. Alternative ownership is one path to community benefit. Others exist: strong community advisory roles in externally-owned facilities, contractual commitments to community benefit, collaborative governance arrangements. Community benefit does not require community ownership if other mechanisms achieve similar goals.\nConclusion Alternative ownership models promise structural transformation. Community ownership could align healthcare incentives with community benefit in ways external ownership cannot. The promise is real.\nThe proven capacity is limited. Healthcare cooperatives can work, as HealthPartners demonstrates, but building them requires decades. Worker cooperatives can work, as CHCA demonstrates, but replication is difficult. Community land trusts for healthcare barely exist. The ACA CO-OP program showed that federal investment cannot reliably create viable healthcare cooperatives.\nEvidence supports a modest assessment. Alternative ownership succeeds in specific circumstances with adequate capital, skilled management, realistic timelines, and supportive policy environments. These conditions rarely exist in the rural communities most needing healthcare transformation. Alternative ownership is not a general solution.\nRHTP can support alternative ownership in communities where conditions favor success. It should not promote alternative ownership as transformation strategy for communities lacking required conditions.

</div>

<p>Healthcare cooperatives, worker-owned agencies, community land trusts, and social enterprises promise to align ownership structure with community benefit. The theory is compelling: <strong>who owns determines who decides, and who decides determines whether communities thrive or decline</strong>. External owners extract value; community owners reinvest it. External owners make portfolio decisions from distant headquarters; community owners make decisions reflecting local priorities. The promise is structural transformation, not incremental service improvement.</p>
<p>The promise exceeds proven capacity. Alternative ownership models remain marginal in American healthcare. The most successful examples serve millions but required decades to build. Recent attempts to create healthcare cooperatives collapsed spectacularly: 20 of 23 ACA CO-OPs failed within three years. Worker-owned healthcare cooperatives exist and demonstrate compelling outcomes, but they are small, concentrated in specific sectors, and difficult to replicate. Community land trusts for health facilities barely exist at all.</p>
<p>This article assesses whether alternative ownership models offer genuine transformation potential or remain inspiring exceptions that cannot scale. The evidence suggests both: models exist that work, but the conditions enabling success are demanding, and failure is common. RHTP cannot assume alternative ownership offers ready solutions. It can support promising models while honestly assessing what it takes to succeed.</p>
<h2 id="the-alternative-ownership-landscape">The Alternative Ownership Landscape<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-alternative-ownership-landscape">#</a></h2>
<p>Alternative ownership in healthcare takes multiple forms, each with distinct characteristics, scale, and evidence base.</p>
<p><strong>Healthcare Cooperatives</strong> are member-owned insurance and delivery organizations. Members hold ownership stakes, elect governance, and share in organizational surpluses. The United States has perhaps <strong>50 healthcare cooperatives</strong> with meaningful scale, though definitions vary. Most are regional insurance plans; some integrate insurance with care delivery.</p>
<p><strong>Worker-Owned Cooperatives</strong> give employees ownership stakes and governance voice. In healthcare, worker cooperatives concentrate in <strong>home care and direct care services</strong>. The sector includes perhaps 20 to 30 organizations with meaningful scale, plus numerous small worker cooperatives in dental, behavioral health, and primary care.</p>
<p><strong>Community Land Trusts</strong> separate land ownership from facility operation. The trust owns land permanently; healthcare organizations lease facilities. This structure prevents facility sale and closure while allowing operational flexibility. Healthcare-specific community land trusts are <strong>extremely rare</strong>, perhaps fewer than 10 nationally, most in planning stages rather than operation.</p>
<p><strong>Social Enterprises</strong> blend mission and market. Healthcare social enterprises generate revenue through services while pursuing social goals. The category is broad and definitionally contested. Thousands of organizations might qualify, but few have healthcare as primary mission.</p>

<p>The healthcare cooperative story includes both the most successful and most catastrophic examples of alternative ownership in American healthcare.</p>
<h3 id="the-success-stories">The Success Stories<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-success-stories">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>HealthPartners</strong> in Minnesota is the largest consumer-governed nonprofit health organization in the United States, serving <strong>1.8 million members</strong> with both insurance and care delivery. Founded in 1957 after two decades of advocacy to change Minnesota law prohibiting cooperative medicine, HealthPartners grew through mergers, including with Park Nicollet Health Services, Regions Hospital, and multiple regional clinics. HealthPartners owns hospitals, employs physicians, and operates one of the nation&rsquo;s largest health research foundations.</p>
<p>HealthPartners demonstrates that <strong>cooperative healthcare can achieve scale and quality</strong>. The organization has received CMS Health Equity Awards and IBM Watson Health recognition as a top 15 health system. Member governance influences strategy. Surpluses reinvest in services rather than flowing to shareholders.</p>
<p><strong>Group Health Cooperative</strong> of Washington State served over 600,000 members from its 1947 founding until Kaiser Permanente acquired it in 2017. For decades, Group Health operated as a consumer-governed integrated delivery system: members owned the plan, elected the board, and received care through Group Health facilities. The organization pioneered patient-centered medical homes and achieved outcomes that outperformed regional competitors.</p>
<p>Group Health&rsquo;s sale to Kaiser raises questions about cooperative sustainability. The board approved the acquisition, citing benefits for members. Critics argued the sale represented failure of the cooperative model: after 70 years, the organization could not remain independent. Supporters countered that members received value through the transition. The acquisition illustrates cooperative governance working as designed (member representatives making decisions) while raising questions about long-term viability.</p>
<p><strong>Group Health Cooperative of South Central Wisconsin</strong> continues operating independently, serving over <strong>80,000 members</strong> in the Madison area. Founded over 40 years ago, GHC-SCW operates as a member-owned HMO with its own clinics. The organization demonstrates that regional healthcare cooperatives can survive and compete with commercial insurers.</p>
<h3 id="the-aca-co-op-catastrophe">The ACA CO-OP Catastrophe<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-aca-co-op-catastrophe">#</a></h3>
<p>The Affordable Care Act created <strong>Consumer Operated and Oriented Plans (CO-OPs)</strong> as an alternative to the public option that progressive Democrats had sought. The program provided <strong>$2.4 billion in federal loans</strong> to establish 23 new nonprofit, consumer-governed health insurance cooperatives beginning in 2014.</p>
<p><strong>Twenty of 23 CO-OPs failed within four years.</strong> By 2020, only three remained: Community Health Options in Maine, Mountain Health CO-OP in Montana (also serving Idaho and Wyoming), and Common Ground Healthcare Cooperative in Wisconsin. The collapse affected over 700,000 enrollees who lost coverage and had to find new plans.</p>
<p>The failure had multiple causes:</p>
<p><strong>Inadequate capitalization.</strong> CO-OPs received loans, not grants, and were prohibited from spending loan funds on marketing. Startup insurers competing against established carriers with decades of reserves and market presence were structurally disadvantaged.</p>
<p><strong>Risk corridor payment failure.</strong> The ACA included risk corridor provisions to stabilize new insurers by transferring funds from profitable plans to those with losses. Political opposition led to budget neutrality requirements, and payments in 2014-2016 delivered only <strong>12.6% of requested amounts</strong>. CO-OPs that had priced premiums assuming risk corridor support faced catastrophic losses.</p>
<p><strong>Management inexperience.</strong> ACA provisions prohibited anyone affiliated with existing insurers from serving on CO-OP boards. This excluded the people with actual experience running health insurance companies. CO-OPs were led by mission-driven founders who often lacked operational expertise.</p>
<p><strong>Adverse selection.</strong> CO-OPs that priced aggressively to gain market share attracted higher-risk enrollees. Lower premiums drew sicker populations, creating losses that required premium increases, which drove away healthier members, accelerating the death spiral.</p>
<p>The surviving CO-OPs share characteristics: conservative pricing, geographic focus, strong management, and good fortune. Community Health Options in Maine had early profitability that provided cushion for later losses. Common Ground received a <strong>$30 million lifeline loan</strong> from an anonymous source in 2016. Mountain Health operates in low-population states with limited competition.</p>
<p><strong>The CO-OP experience demonstrates that cooperative governance does not guarantee success.</strong> Consumer ownership did not prevent catastrophic failure. Democratic governance did not produce better decisions than commercial insurer governance. The structural advantages cooperatives supposedly offer did not materialize at scale under real-world conditions.</p>
<h3 id="what-the-evidence-shows">What the Evidence Shows<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-the-evidence-shows">#</a></h3>
<p>Healthcare cooperatives can work. HealthPartners proves that a consumer-governed organization can achieve major scale and excellent outcomes. But HealthPartners took <strong>60 years</strong> to reach current size, growing through careful expansion and strategic mergers during a period when healthcare markets were less concentrated and competitive.</p>
<p><strong>Creating new healthcare cooperatives in the current environment is extremely difficult.</strong> The ACA CO-OP program represented the largest-ever federal investment in cooperative healthcare development. Its failure rate exceeded 85%. The three survivors serve perhaps 130,000 people combined, from $2.4 billion in federal loans.</p>
<p>Cooperative governance provides no magic. Democratic decision-making by members does not guarantee financial viability, operational excellence, or better outcomes. What cooperatives offer is alignment: member interests and organizational interests coincide because members own the organization. That alignment matters, but it is not sufficient for success.</p>
<h2 id="worker-owned-healthcare-the-chca-model">Worker-Owned Healthcare: The CHCA Model<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#worker-owned-healthcare-the-chca-model">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Cooperative Home Care Associates (CHCA)</strong> in the Bronx is the largest worker-owned cooperative in the United States, with <strong>over 2,000 employees</strong>, nearly all Latina and African American women. Founded in 1985 with 12 home health aides, CHCA provides home care services while demonstrating that worker ownership can transform one of healthcare&rsquo;s lowest-wage sectors.</p>
<h3 id="how-worker-ownership-works">How Worker Ownership Works<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-worker-ownership-works">#</a></h3>
<p>CHCA employees can purchase <strong>ownership stakes for $1,000</strong>, paid through modest weekly payroll deductions of $3.65. Worker-owners receive annual dividends based on profitability, vote in elections for 8 of 13 board seats, and participate in governance. The cooperative structure creates direct connection between worker effort and organizational success.</p>
<p>The ownership model produces measurable outcomes:</p>
<p><strong>Higher wages.</strong> CHCA pays above market rates for home health aides and provides guaranteed hours for senior workers. The &ldquo;Guaranteed Hours Program&rdquo; ensures minimum 30 hours weekly for aides with three years of service.</p>
<p><strong>Better retention.</strong> Home care experiences chronic turnover exceeding 60% annually industry-wide. CHCA retention significantly exceeds industry averages. Workers with ownership stakes and career pathways stay longer.</p>
<p><strong>Training investment.</strong> CHCA&rsquo;s training program provides <strong>150 hours of instruction</strong>, double the 75 hours required by regulation. The cooperative can invest in training because it captures returns through reduced turnover.</p>
<p><strong>Quality outcomes.</strong> CHCA earned <strong>B Corp certification</strong> in 2012, the first home care company certified. Its B Impact score of 128.2 far exceeds the median business score of 50.9.</p>
<h3 id="why-replication-is-difficult">Why Replication Is Difficult<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#why-replication-is-difficult">#</a></h3>
<p>CHCA&rsquo;s success has inspired replication efforts across the country. Results are mixed. Worker cooperatives in home care have formed in Wisconsin, Washington, California, and elsewhere. Most remain small. None approaches CHCA&rsquo;s scale.</p>
<p><strong>Replication challenges include:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Startup capital.</strong> Cooperatives need capital to launch, but worker-owners typically cannot contribute substantial investment. CHCA benefited from foundation support and nonprofit partnerships during early growth. Replicating these conditions elsewhere is difficult.</p>
<p><strong>Management expertise.</strong> Cooperative governance requires skilled management that can work within democratic structures. CHCA developed management capacity over decades. New cooperatives must find or develop such leadership.</p>
<p><strong>Market context.</strong> CHCA operates in New York City, with large Medicaid-funded home care demand and a population willing to work in home care. Rural areas have smaller markets and different labor pools.</p>
<p><strong>Regulatory navigation.</strong> Home care regulation varies by state. Cooperative structures must fit within licensing, reimbursement, and workforce requirements that were not designed with cooperatives in mind.</p>
<p><strong>The ICA Group</strong>, a cooperative development organization, has supported healthcare worker cooperative formation for decades. Their experience shows that success requires <strong>sustained technical assistance, patient capital, and realistic timelines</strong>. Worker cooperatives are not quick solutions. They require years to build.</p>
<p><strong>A rural community attempting to create a worker-owned cooperative for home care or other health services faces a 5 to 10 year development process</strong>, assuming everything goes well. RHTP&rsquo;s five-year funding window does not match cooperative development timelines.</p>
<h2 id="community-land-trusts-the-unexplored-frontier">Community Land Trusts: The Unexplored Frontier<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#community-land-trusts-the-unexplored-frontier">#</a></h2>
<p>Community land trusts (CLTs) separate land ownership from what sits on the land. The trust owns property permanently; users lease it long-term. This structure has transformed affordable housing in hundreds of communities. <strong>Application to healthcare remains largely theoretical.</strong></p>
<h3 id="the-concept">The Concept<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-concept">#</a></h3>
<p>A healthcare community land trust would own the land beneath healthcare facilities. Hospitals, clinics, or nursing homes would lease from the trust. The structure would:</p>
<p><strong>Prevent facility closure through sale.</strong> When health systems sell facilities, buyers may close them. If the community owns the land, closure requires community consent.</p>
<p><strong>Retain community control.</strong> Land trust governance typically includes community representation. Healthcare decisions affecting the community would involve community voice.</p>
<p><strong>Capture land value.</strong> Healthcare facilities can appreciate substantially. Community land ownership keeps appreciation value in the community rather than flowing to facility owners.</p>
<h3 id="why-it-barely-exists">Why It Barely Exists<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#why-it-barely-exists">#</a></h3>
<p>Community land trusts for healthcare face obstacles that housing CLTs do not:</p>
<p><strong>Healthcare complexity.</strong> Running a hospital requires licensure, credentialing, regulatory compliance, and operational expertise that housing management does not. Land trusts cannot operate healthcare facilities; they need operational partners. Finding qualified operators willing to work within land trust structures is difficult.</p>
<p><strong>Capital requirements.</strong> Acquiring healthcare facility land requires substantial capital. Housing CLTs often acquire individual parcels or small buildings. Hospital campuses involve millions in land value.</p>
<p><strong>Timing mismatch.</strong> CLTs typically acquire land when property values are low or through donation. Healthcare facility land becomes available when facilities close or systems divest, often under time pressure that CLT acquisition processes cannot meet.</p>
<p><strong>Limited precedent.</strong> Housing CLTs can learn from hundreds of existing models. Healthcare CLTs have essentially no models to follow. Each attempt requires reinventing basic structures.</p>
<p><strong>Scattered attempts exist.</strong> Community health centers have explored CLT structures for their facilities. At least one dental clinic operates on community land trust property. Rural communities facing hospital closure have discussed CLT acquisition. None has produced a mature, replicable model.</p>
<p><strong>The promise remains theoretical.</strong> Community land ownership of healthcare infrastructure makes conceptual sense. Practical application at scale does not yet exist. RHTP cannot fund proven CLT models because proven models do not exist.</p>
<h2 id="the-failed-cooperative-attempt">The Failed Cooperative Attempt<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-failed-cooperative-attempt">#</a></h2>
<p><em>Mineral County, population 3,100, lost its only hospital in 2019. The 25-bed critical access hospital had operated for 60 years before its owner, a regional health system, determined it was no longer financially viable. The system offered the facility to the county, which lacked resources to operate it.</em></p>
<p><em>A group of community leaders proposed a cooperative model. Community members would purchase shares, elect a board, and hire management to reopen the facility as a community-owned hospital. The proposal inspired widespread enthusiasm. Over 200 residents attended the initial meeting. Local media covered the effort extensively.</em></p>
<p><em>Reality proved more difficult than inspiration. The cooperative needed $3 million in member shares to have any chance of viability. Mineral County&rsquo;s median household income was $38,000. Even at $500 per share, reaching $3 million required 6,000 shares from a population of 3,100. The math did not work.</em></p>
<p><em>Regulatory requirements compounded financial challenges. Reopening required state hospital licensure, CMS certification, physician credentialing, and compliance infrastructure. The cooperative lacked anyone with hospital administration experience. Consultants estimated $500,000 in professional services just to navigate regulatory requirements.</em></p>
<p><em>Twenty-seven months after the hospital closed, the cooperative effort ended. The building remains empty. Residents drive 45 minutes to the nearest hospital. The community learned that enthusiasm cannot substitute for capital, and local ownership cannot overcome structural healthcare economics.</em></p>
<p><em>The failure illustrates alternative ownership&rsquo;s core limitation: community capacity rarely matches community need.</em></p>
<h2 id="alternative-perspective-the-ownership-structure-promise">Alternative Perspective: The Ownership Structure Promise<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#alternative-perspective-the-ownership-structure-promise">#</a></h2>
<p>The argument for alternative ownership has genuine force, even if implementation is difficult.</p>
<p><strong>Ownership determines incentives.</strong> Investor-owned healthcare organizations respond to shareholder demands for returns. Nonprofit organizations respond to board interests that may not align with community needs. Community-owned organizations respond to community interests because communities own them.</p>
<p><strong>Value stays local.</strong> When HealthPartners generates surplus, that surplus reinvests in services for Minnesota communities. When investor-owned health systems generate profit, that profit flows to shareholders who may live anywhere. The difference compounds over decades.</p>
<p><strong>Closure requires community consent.</strong> External owners close facilities based on portfolio strategy. Community owners must convince the community that closure serves community interest. This higher bar prevents closures that serve owners but harm communities.</p>
<p><strong>Workers with stakes work differently.</strong> CHCA demonstrates that worker-owners provide better care, stay longer, and build organizational capacity that benefits clients. The ownership connection is real, not rhetorical.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment:</strong> The ownership structure argument is correct in theory. Ownership matters. Incentives matter. Community ownership aligns incentives with community benefit in ways external ownership cannot. But the argument&rsquo;s validity does not mean alternative ownership is achievable. Structural advantages mean nothing if the structure cannot be built. The question is not whether community ownership would be better, but whether community ownership is possible given available resources, capacity, and timeframes.</p>

<h2 id="when-alternative-ownership-can-support-transformation">When Alternative Ownership Can Support Transformation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#when-alternative-ownership-can-support-transformation">#</a></h2>
<p>Alternative ownership succeeds when specific conditions exist:</p>
<p><strong>Existing model to build on.</strong> HealthPartners grew from Group Health&rsquo;s foundation. CHCA inspired replication efforts with proven operational models. Creating entirely new models requires capabilities most communities lack.</p>
<p><strong>Adequate capitalization.</strong> The ACA CO-OPs failed largely because they were undercapitalized from the start. Worker cooperatives need patient capital during multi-year development. Community land trusts require acquisition funds. Without capital, alternative ownership cannot launch.</p>
<p><strong>Management expertise.</strong> Democratic governance does not eliminate need for professional management. Cooperatives that succeed have skilled executives who can work within democratic structures. Finding such leaders, especially in rural areas, is difficult.</p>
<p><strong>Realistic timelines.</strong> Healthcare cooperatives take decades to achieve scale. Worker cooperatives take years to stabilize. RHTP&rsquo;s five-year window does not match these development timelines. Communities expecting quick results will be disappointed.</p>
<p><strong>Supportive policy environment.</strong> Healthcare regulation assumes conventional ownership structures. Cooperatives must navigate licensure, reimbursement, and compliance requirements designed for investor-owned or nonprofit organizations. States with cooperative-friendly policies offer better environments.</p>
<h2 id="when-alternative-ownership-cannot-support-transformation">When Alternative Ownership Cannot Support Transformation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#when-alternative-ownership-cannot-support-transformation">#</a></h2>
<p>Alternative ownership fails when conditions preclude success:</p>
<p><strong>Community capacity insufficient.</strong> The Mineral County cooperative failed because community resources could not support the capital requirements. Communities lacking wealth, expertise, or organizational capacity cannot build alternative ownership structures regardless of desire.</p>
<p><strong>No model to adapt.</strong> Community land trusts for healthcare have essentially no proven models. Communities cannot adopt what does not exist. Pioneering new models requires resources and risk tolerance that RHTP cannot reasonably expect.</p>
<p><strong>Timeline mismatch.</strong> RHTP needs transformation within five years. Cooperative development requires longer. Funding alternative ownership development that cannot produce results within program timeframes wastes resources.</p>
<p><strong>Market conditions hostile.</strong> Cooperatives in highly competitive, consolidated markets face structural disadvantages. Most ACA CO-OPs failed partly because they competed against established commercial insurers with massive scale advantages. Rural markets with limited competition may be more favorable.</p>
<h2 id="recommendations">Recommendations<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#recommendations">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>For Alternative Ownership Advocates</strong></p>
<p>Stop overpromising. Alternative ownership is difficult, failure is common, and success requires conditions that rarely exist. Advocates who claim alternative ownership can solve rural healthcare crises set communities up for disappointment. Honest assessment of what alternative ownership requires serves communities better than inspirational rhetoric.</p>
<p>Build the evidence base. The strongest argument for alternative ownership would be demonstrated success at scale. Invest in documenting what works, identifying success factors, and creating replicable models. Until evidence accumulates, alternative ownership remains promising hypothesis rather than proven solution.</p>
<p>Develop technical assistance capacity. Communities cannot build alternative ownership alone. The ICA Group, cooperative development organizations, and technical assistance providers are essential. Investment in TA capacity produces more alternative ownership success than investment in individual community attempts.</p>
<p><strong>For State Agencies</strong></p>
<p>Do not assume alternative ownership offers ready solutions. The evidence base is thin. Success is rare. Failure is common. States that allocate significant RHTP resources to alternative ownership development are betting on approaches without proven track records.</p>
<p>Support proven models where they exist. HealthPartners-style consumer cooperatives work. CHCA-style worker cooperatives work. Supporting expansion of proven models offers better odds than funding new model development.</p>
<p>Allow realistic timelines. If alternative ownership development proceeds, recognize that meaningful results require years beyond RHTP&rsquo;s five-year window. Fund development knowing that transformation will occur after program ends, if at all.</p>
<p><strong>For CMS</strong></p>
<p>Do not require alternative ownership as transformation strategy. The evidence does not support alternative ownership as general solution. Communities that want to pursue alternative ownership should be able to, but RHTP should not push communities toward approaches with high failure rates.</p>
<p>Learn from the CO-OP disaster. The ACA CO-OP program represented the largest federal investment in cooperative healthcare ever attempted. It failed catastrophically. Any future federal support for healthcare cooperatives should incorporate lessons from that failure: adequate capitalization, realistic expectations, experienced management, and time horizons matching development needs.</p>
<p><strong>For Communities</strong></p>
<p>Assess capacity honestly before attempting alternative ownership. Enthusiasm is not enough. Capital, expertise, management, and time are required. Communities lacking these resources should not pursue alternative ownership regardless of its appeal.</p>
<p>Learn from failure. The Mineral County cooperative attempt failed, but the community learned what alternative ownership actually requires. Communities considering alternative ownership should study failures as carefully as successes.</p>
<p>Consider alternatives to ownership. Alternative ownership is one path to community benefit. Others exist: strong community advisory roles in externally-owned facilities, contractual commitments to community benefit, collaborative governance arrangements. Community benefit does not require community ownership if other mechanisms achieve similar goals.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>Alternative ownership models promise structural transformation. Community ownership could align healthcare incentives with community benefit in ways external ownership cannot. The promise is real.</p>
<p>The proven capacity is limited. Healthcare cooperatives can work, as HealthPartners demonstrates, but building them requires decades. Worker cooperatives can work, as CHCA demonstrates, but replication is difficult. Community land trusts for healthcare barely exist. The ACA CO-OP program showed that federal investment cannot reliably create viable healthcare cooperatives.</p>
<p><strong>Evidence supports a modest assessment.</strong> Alternative ownership succeeds in specific circumstances with adequate capital, skilled management, realistic timelines, and supportive policy environments. These conditions rarely exist in the rural communities most needing healthcare transformation. Alternative ownership is not a general solution.</p>
<p>RHTP can support alternative ownership in communities where conditions favor success. It should not promote alternative ownership as transformation strategy for communities lacking required conditions. Honest assessment, not inspirational rhetoric, serves communities best.</p>
