  "articleBody": "In many rural communities, the church is not merely one organization among many. It is the only organization. The building with heat and meeting space. The network that knows who needs help. The institution with volunteers, a bank account, and weekly gatherings. When federal policy assumes community organizations exist to partner with healthcare systems, it often unknowingly assumes churches exist. When RHTP applications promise “community engagement” and “CBO partnerships,” they frequently depend on faith-based infrastructure that secular policy documents rarely name.\nThis article examines faith-based organizations as rural health infrastructure, assessing their actual capacity to support transformation rather than assuming capacity exists. The analysis reveals a fundamental tension: faith-based organizations often possess the community embeddedness that makes transformation partnerships valuable, but meeting federal program requirements may destroy the informality that creates their value. Professionalization could hollow out what makes churches useful even as it makes them eligible for funding.\nThe stakes extend beyond any individual program. If rural health transformation depends on community infrastructure, and if faith-based organizations constitute the primary community infrastructure in most rural areas, then honest assessment of faith-based capacity becomes essential. The alternative is building transformation strategies on infrastructure that policy documents assume exists but may not.\nThe Scale of Faith-Based Infrastructure The National Congregations Study, the most comprehensive dataset on American religious organizations, reveals both the ubiquity and the fragility of rural church infrastructure.\nApproximately 350,000 to 380,000 congregations operate across the United States, with roughly one-third located in rural areas. This suggests approximately 115,000 to 125,000 rural congregations serving communities where other organizational infrastructure is often absent. The median congregation has 75 regular participants and an annual budget under $100,000. Rural congregations skew smaller: the typical rural church has 40 to 60 regular attenders and annual revenues of $50,000 to $75,000.\nThese numbers matter for transformation capacity. A church with 50 members and a $60,000 annual budget can maintain a building, pay a part-time pastor, and organize volunteers. It cannot hire a professional program coordinator, implement federal reporting requirements, or absorb the administrative burden of formal healthcare partnerships. Scale limitations are not organizational failures; they are structural features of rural religious life.\nThe 83% of congregations reporting some social service involvement represents participation, not capacity. This figure from the National Congregations Study includes everything from annual food drives to comprehensive social service programs. Most rural church social service involvement means volunteers occasionally helping neighbors, not professional program implementation. The policy-relevant question is not whether churches do social services but whether they can absorb professional healthcare partnership roles.\nDecline and Closure Patterns Rural church infrastructure is declining. Approximately 4,000 to 4,500 churches close annually, with closures concentrated in rural areas and declining denominations. Projections suggest this rate will accelerate as post-World War II church plants reach typical institutional lifespans of 80 to 120 years. Some analysts project 100,000 or more church closures by 2050, though precise numbers remain uncertain.\nThe pattern parallels rural community decline more broadly. Young people leave. Membership ages. Giving declines. Buildings deteriorate. Part-time pastors serve multiple congregations. The infrastructure that RHTP assumes will partner with healthcare systems is itself in crisis. In the most stressed rural communities, church capacity is declining alongside healthcare access rather than providing a stable base for transformation.\nRural Black congregations face particularly acute infrastructure challenges. Research from the National Congregations Study found that only 46% of rural Black congregations had any online presence pre-pandemic, compared to 89% of other congregations. This 43-percentage-point gap reflects broader resource disparities that limit capacity for professional healthcare partnerships regardless of community commitment.\nWhat Faith-Based Organizations Actually Do Understanding faith-based transformation capacity requires distinguishing between informal community roles and formal program implementation.\nInformal Community Functions Churches serve as gathering infrastructure in communities lacking other public spaces. The church building may be the only heated meeting room for miles. Church members constitute information networks knowing who is sick, who needs rides, who faces eviction. Pastoral visits provide health surveillance identifying unmet needs that clinical systems never see. These functions do not appear in grant applications or program metrics, but they represent genuine community health contributions.\nFood assistance exemplifies informal faith-based health activity. Most rural churches maintain some food ministry, from pantries to community meals to emergency assistance. These programs typically operate on volunteer labor, donated goods, and minimal organization. They address food insecurity without professional nutrition programming, SNAP enrollment assistance, or food-as-medicine coordination that RHTP envisions.\nTransportation assistance similarly operates informally. Church members drive neighbors to appointments, pick up prescriptions, and check on homebound congregants. No scheduling software, volunteer management systems, or liability coverage structures this assistance. It works because people know each other and help each other. Formalizing it into a volunteer driver program with background checks, insurance, and documentation would change its character fundamentally.\nFormal Program Capacity Some faith-based organizations have developed professional social service capacity. These represent the high-capacity end of the spectrum that policy discussions often assume is typical.\nCatholic Charities USA coordinates 177 member agencies providing services to over 8.5 million people annually across more than 2,600 sites. Services span food assistance, housing, health care, immigration support, and disaster relief. Catholic Charities agencies employ professional staff, maintain federal grant compliance capacity, and operate at scales enabling healthcare partnership. However, Catholic Charities agencies concentrate in urban areas. Rural Catholic communities typically lack local Catholic Charities presence, leaving parishes without professional social service infrastructure.\nLutheran Services in America leads a network of 300 health and human services organizations serving 6 million people annually in 1,400 communities. The network includes over $23 billion in combined organizational capacity. Lutheran Services organizations provide sophisticated programming in aging services, behavioral health, child welfare, and disability services. Like Catholic Charities, Lutheran Services capacity concentrates in urban and suburban areas with limited rural presence relative to rural Lutheran congregations.\nMethodist Healthcare Ministries of South Texas represents exceptional faith-based rural health capacity. The organization invests $214 million annually across a 74-county service area, operating the Wesley Nurse program with 80+ sites throughout South Texas. Wesley Nurses are registered nurses employed by Methodist Healthcare Ministries but stationed at churches, providing care coordination, health education, and resource navigation for uninsured and underserved populations. Since inception, Methodist Healthcare Ministries has provided over $1.66 billion in health care services and represents one of the largest private funding sources for community health care to low-income families in South Texas.\nThe Methodist Healthcare Ministries model demonstrates what professionalized faith-based health infrastructure can achieve. It also demonstrates the resources required: the organization exists because of unique historical circumstances creating sustained funding through partnership with HCA Healthcare. Replicating this model requires capital, governance structures, and institutional relationships that most faith communities lack.\nThe Core Tension: Authenticity versus Institutional Requirements Faith-based organizations derive value from being embedded in communities, operating informally, and responding to neighbors rather than regulations. Federal program requirements demand formal governance, financial controls, reporting systems, and professional management. Meeting requirements may destroy authenticity.\nThe Authenticity Argument Churches work as community infrastructure because they are not bureaucratic. The pastor who visits a sick parishioner does not document the encounter for billing purposes. The church member who drives a neighbor to chemotherapy does not complete a transportation log. The deacon who notices a family struggling does not enter a referral into a closed-loop system. Informal response to community need operates through relationships, not systems.\nWhen churches formalize services, they often lose effectiveness. A church that provides emergency food assistance through informal donation becomes a food pantry with hours, eligibility requirements, and documentation. The informality that allowed immediate response to crisis becomes process that creates barriers. Professionalization imports the bureaucratic characteristics that made secular services inadequate in the first place.\nFaith-based organizations also provide moral authority that secular programs cannot replicate. When a pastor encourages health behavior change, the message carries weight that clinical recommendations may lack. When church members support recovery from addiction, they offer spiritual resources alongside social support. Professionalizing these functions risks severing them from the faith context that makes them effective.\nThe Institutional Necessity Argument Federal funds require accountability. Taxpayers deserve assurance that money reaches intended purposes. The same informality that enables responsiveness also enables misuse. Without financial controls, funds can be diverted. Without documentation, outcomes cannot be verified. Without professional management, programs fail despite good intentions.\nFaith-based organizations often lack capacity for the administrative work that accountability requires. Small churches with volunteer leadership cannot maintain the record-keeping, reporting, and compliance systems that federal programs demand. This is not bad faith; it is organizational reality. Expecting volunteer-led organizations to perform professional administrative functions sets them up for failure.\nMoreover, informal assistance often fails to address structural needs that transformation requires. A church that helps members navigate healthcare appointments provides valuable service. A church that helps a community implement population health management, social needs screening, and closed-loop referral systems requires different capabilities. Transformation demands more than informal neighborly assistance scaled up.\nEvidence on the Tension The Faith Community Nursing movement provides evidence on how faith-based health roles can professionalize while maintaining community connection. Approximately 15,000 registered nurses practice as faith community nurses (also called parish nurses) in the United States. Only about 35% receive compensation; most volunteer.\nFaith community nursing represents structured informality. Nurses bring professional training and credentials while working within faith community contexts. They focus on health promotion, chronic disease management, and care navigation rather than hands-on clinical care. The model adds professional capacity without replacing community relationships.\nHowever, faith community nursing also demonstrates sustainability challenges. Volunteer-dependent programs struggle with continuity. Compensated positions require funding that most congregations cannot provide. The 80+ Wesley Nurse sites across South Texas exist because Methodist Healthcare Ministries provides employment, supervision, and support infrastructure. Individual congregations rarely sustain professional faith community nursing independently.\nFaith-Based Organization Capacity Assessment The following organizations illustrate the range of faith-based capacity relevant to rural health transformation.\nOrganization Type Geography Staff Annual Budget Healthcare Role RHTP Potential Capacity Assessment Methodist Healthcare Ministries of South Texas Health system ministry 74 counties, South Texas 400+ employees $214 million Wesley Nurses, clinics, CHWs, counseling Model partner Professional capacity, proven outcomes, unique funding structure Catholic Charities Diocese of Jackson Diocesan agency Mississippi 50+ employees $8-12 million Food, housing, immigrant services Potential partner Professional capacity, but healthcare not primary focus Lutheran Services in Iowa State LSA affiliate Statewide 200+ employees $25+ million Refugee services, behavioral health, senior housing Potential partner Strong capacity, primarily urban concentration North Carolina Council of Churches Partners in Health and Wholeness Ecumenical network Statewide NC 5-10 staff $1-2 million CHW training, rural church health ministry support Strong partner Capacity building focus, 33 churches certified with CHWs First United Methodist Church, Struthers OH Local congregation Single community Part-time pastor Under $100,000 Informal visiting, food assistance Limited partner Declining membership, closure threatened Rural Baptist Association, Southeast Kentucky Denominational network Multi-county No paid staff Under $50,000 Disaster relief coordination, informal assistance Minimal partner Volunteer-only, no professional capacity Corpus Christi Catholic Church, Bronzeville Urban parish (closed) Chicago None (closed 2021) N/A Former soup kitchen, school (closed) None Example of capacity loss through closure Texas Health Faith Community Nursing Network Health system partnership North Texas Network of FCNs System-supported FCN coordination, health ministry development Strong partner Hospital system provides infrastructure Patterns in Capacity Several patterns emerge from capacity assessment:\nProfessional capacity concentrates in health system-affiliated organizations. Methodist Healthcare Ministries, Catholic health systems with parish nurse programs, and hospital-sponsored faith community nursing networks demonstrate that substantial healthcare capacity requires institutional support beyond what individual congregations provide. Independent congregations rarely achieve professional healthcare capacity regardless of community commitment.\nDenominational and ecumenical networks can build capacity that individual churches cannot. The North Carolina Council of Churches Partners in Health and Wholeness program demonstrates network-level capacity building, training CHWs in rural churches and connecting congregations with health departments and hospitals. Networks aggregate what individual churches cannot sustain.\nLocal congregations provide community presence, not program capacity. The typical rural church can offer meeting space, volunteer labor, relationship networks, and moral support. It cannot offer professional program management, federal compliance, or sustained operations independent of volunteer availability. Expecting otherwise misunderstands organizational reality.\nVignette: When the Hospital Called the Church The names and some details have been altered, but the situation reflects documented patterns in faith-based rural health partnerships.\nMercy Regional Medical Center had a problem. Too many patients discharged from the hospital returned within 30 days, often with preventable complications. Social workers identified that many readmissions involved patients who lived alone, lacked transportation to follow-up appointments, or struggled to afford medications. The hospital needed community partners to support patients after discharge.\nSomeone suggested partnering with churches. The county had 47 congregations for 18,000 residents. Several churches ran food pantries and visited homebound members. The hospital’s mission statement referenced faith-based heritage. Partnership seemed natural.\nThe community health director called Pastor Linda Martinez at First Baptist, the largest church in town with 200 members. Could the church help with care transitions? Perhaps volunteers could call discharged patients, provide rides to appointments, help with medication pickup?\nPastor Martinez wanted to help. She convened the church’s deacon board. Several members volunteered immediately. The church had been helping members navigate healthcare for years. Formalizing the arrangement seemed straightforward.\nThen the requirements arrived.\nBackground checks for all volunteers who would contact patients. Reasonable, but the church had never run background checks. Cost: $40 per person. Twenty volunteers meant $800 the church had not budgeted.\nHIPAA training for anyone accessing patient information. The hospital offered online modules. Several older volunteers did not have email accounts or internet access at home.\nDocumentation requirements for each patient contact. The hospital needed records for compliance. Volunteers would need to complete forms after each call or visit. One deacon asked: “If I see Betty Johnson at the grocery store and ask about her knee surgery, do I fill out a form?”\nLiability coverage for volunteer drivers. The church’s insurance did not cover volunteers transporting non-members for hospital-related purposes. Adding coverage cost $2,400 annually.\nReporting requirements quarterly. Patient contacts, outcomes, volunteer hours. Someone would need to compile data. The church had no administrative staff.\nThe deacon board met again. The requirements made sense individually. Together they transformed neighborly assistance into a professional program the church could not operate. The $3,200 in new costs represented 5% of the church’s annual budget. The documentation and reporting would fall to Pastor Martinez, already stretched between two congregations.\nFirst Baptist declined the formal partnership. Church members continued helping informally. Betty Johnson still got rides from her Sunday School class. The deacon still visited her at home. None of it counted in the hospital’s community benefit reporting.\nThe hospital found a partner in the regional Area Agency on Aging, which had professional staff, existing compliance systems, and infrastructure for the work. The partnership succeeded on paper. But the Agency served the whole region and had limited presence in town. The community connection that churches provided remained outside the formal system.\nPastor Martinez wondered what might have been different. Could the hospital have provided funding for background checks and insurance? Could documentation requirements have been simplified for volunteer-led programs? Could the partnership have built on what the church already did rather than requiring the church to become something different?\nShe did not have answers. She had a congregation to serve, a food pantry to stock, and homebound members to visit. The informal work continued without formal recognition or institutional support.\nAlternative Perspectives The Secularization Argument Some analysts argue that faith-based organizations should not be central to public health infrastructure regardless of their current presence. Public programs should not depend on religious institutions. Relying on churches for health transformation creates problems:\nExclusion risks: Faith-based organizations may serve their own members preferentially. LGBTQ+ individuals, religious minorities, and secular community members may face unwelcome environments or explicit discrimination. Public health infrastructure should be universally accessible.\nProselytization concerns: Some faith-based organizations view service provision as evangelism opportunity. Recipients of assistance may feel pressure to participate in religious activities or express religious beliefs. Health services should not come with religious strings.\nSustainability problems: Church decline makes faith-based infrastructure unreliable for long-term programs. Building public health capacity on declining organizations creates future gaps when churches close.\nAssessment: These concerns have validity. Some faith-based organizations do discriminate. Some do proselytize. Many are declining. However, dismissing faith-based infrastructure ignores organizational reality in rural communities. Where churches are the only functioning community organizations, secular alternatives do not exist to substitute. The practical question is not whether to use faith-based infrastructure but how to do so while managing real concerns about access, coercion, and sustainability.\nThe Capacity Building Argument Others argue that faith-based organizations can develop professional capacity with appropriate investment. The Duke Endowment’s work in North Carolina demonstrates intentional capacity building:\nPartners in Health and Wholeness (NC Council of Churches) connects rural churches with health departments for CHW training NC State Institute for Emerging Issues helps congregations use data for community engagement planning 38 churches have developed data-driven action plans for community health This approach treats faith-based capacity as developmental rather than fixed. Rather than assuming churches either have capacity or do not, it invests in building capacity where potential exists. The investment includes training, technical assistance, and connection to institutional partners who provide infrastructure individual churches lack.\nAssessment: Capacity building can work, but it requires sustained investment that RHTP timelines may not allow. Building professional capacity in volunteer-led organizations takes years, not months. States facing pressure to show transformation progress may not have time for faith-based capacity development. Moreover, capacity building changes organizations. Churches that develop professional program capacity may lose the informal community embeddedness that made them valuable initially.\nThe Parallel Infrastructure Argument A third perspective suggests faith-based and formal healthcare infrastructure should operate in parallel rather than integrating. Churches continue informal community health support. Healthcare systems operate professional programs. The two interact through referrals and relationships without expecting churches to become program implementers.\nThis approach preserves what churches do well: community presence, moral support, relationship networks, informal assistance. It does not burden volunteer organizations with professional requirements they cannot meet. Healthcare systems benefit from community intelligence and referrals without depending on church capacity for program delivery.\nAssessment: Parallel operation may be realistic for most rural churches. However, it also means transformation programs cannot count on church capacity for implementation. If community-based transformation requires community organizations to implement programs, and if churches cannot be those implementers, then transformation depends on building alternative community infrastructure or accepting more limited community engagement.\nWhen Faith-Based Organizations Can Support Transformation Faith-based organizations can contribute to rural health transformation under specific conditions:\nWhen roles match actual capacity. Churches with volunteer leadership and modest budgets can provide meeting space, community connection, moral support, and informal assistance. They cannot provide professional program management. Matching roles to capacity prevents both organizational harm and program failure.\nWhen institutional partners provide infrastructure. The Wesley Nurse model works because Methodist Healthcare Ministries employs the nurses, provides supervision, and maintains compliance systems. Churches provide community presence and relationships. The institutional partner handles what individual congregations cannot.\nWhen networks aggregate individual church contributions. Denominational networks, councils of churches, and ecumenical coalitions can coordinate activities across multiple congregations, provide training and technical assistance, and interface with healthcare systems on behalf of member churches. Networks can achieve collectively what individual churches cannot sustain alone.\nWhen professionalization respects community context. Faith community nursing demonstrates that professional roles can operate within faith contexts without destroying community connection. The key is adding professional capacity to existing relationships rather than replacing relationships with professional structures.\nWhen investment precedes expectation. Capacity building requires resources before programs launch. Churches cannot develop compliance systems after receiving grants. Investment in capacity development must precede expectations for program implementation.\nWhen Faith-Based Organizations Cannot Support Transformation Some situations exceed faith-based organizational capacity regardless of commitment:\nWhen professional program management is required. Federal compliance, outcome documentation, data systems, and continuous quality improvement require professional staff time. Volunteer-led organizations cannot provide this consistently. Expecting professional management from volunteer organizations guarantees failure.\nWhen the church itself is declining. Congregations losing members, reducing budgets, and considering closure cannot take on new program responsibilities. Adding transformation burden to declining organizations accelerates their decline without achieving transformation goals.\nWhen the required scale exceeds congregational scope. Individual churches serve individual communities. Population health management, regional care coordination, and systematic social needs integration operate at scales that individual congregations cannot address. Transformation at scale requires organizational capacity at scale.\nWhen sustainability depends on continued grant funding. Churches that build RHTP-funded programs may be unable to sustain them when funding ends in 2030. If the church cannot continue the work independently, the program represents temporary service expansion rather than transformation.\nRecommendations For State RHTP Implementation Conduct faith-based capacity assessment before assuming church partnership. Many rural communities have church presence without church capacity for formal program roles.\nDifferentiate partnership types based on actual capacity. Some churches can implement professional programs. Most can provide community presence and informal support. Design partnerships accordingly.\nFund institutional partners to support faith-based engagement. Hospital systems, health departments, and regional organizations can provide infrastructure that enables church participation without burdening individual congregations.\nInvest in denominational and ecumenical networks that aggregate capacity across individual churches. Networks can provide training, technical assistance, and compliance support that individual congregations cannot sustain.\nAccept that some communities lack partnerable faith-based infrastructure. Not every rural area has churches with capacity for transformation partnership. Alternative approaches may be necessary where faith-based infrastructure is absent or inadequate.\nFor Healthcare Systems Value churches for community connection, not program capacity. Churches know their communities. They can identify needs, provide referrals, offer moral support, and facilitate trust. Do not expect them to run programs.\nProvide infrastructure rather than expecting churches to develop it. Background checks, insurance, training, documentation systems, and compliance support should come from healthcare partners, not volunteer organizations.\nRespect church autonomy and mission. Churches exist to serve their faith purposes, not healthcare purposes. Partnerships should enhance church mission, not distort it.\nDevelop multiple community partnerships rather than depending on any single church. Individual congregations change, decline, or close. Diversified partnerships provide resilience.\nFor Faith-Based Organizations Assess capacity honestly before accepting formal partnership roles. The desire to help does not create the capacity to help. Overcommitment harms both organizations and communities.\nSeek roles that match actual capacity. Providing meeting space, community connection, and informal support are legitimate contributions. Not every partnership requires program implementation.\nParticipate in capacity-building networks that provide training, technical assistance, and institutional support. Individual churches benefit from collective infrastructure.\nProtect organizational identity within partnerships. Healthcare partnerships should strengthen, not replace, faith community roles.

<p>In many rural communities, the church is not merely one organization among many. <strong>It is the only organization.</strong> The building with heat and meeting space. The network that knows who needs help. The institution with volunteers, a bank account, and weekly gatherings. When federal policy assumes community organizations exist to partner with healthcare systems, it often unknowingly assumes churches exist. When RHTP applications promise &ldquo;community engagement&rdquo; and &ldquo;CBO partnerships,&rdquo; they frequently depend on faith-based infrastructure that secular policy documents rarely name.</p>
<p>This article examines <strong>faith-based organizations as rural health infrastructure</strong>, assessing their actual capacity to support transformation rather than assuming capacity exists. The analysis reveals a fundamental tension: faith-based organizations often possess the community embeddedness that makes transformation partnerships valuable, but meeting federal program requirements may destroy the informality that creates their value. <strong>Professionalization could hollow out what makes churches useful even as it makes them eligible for funding.</strong></p>
<p>The stakes extend beyond any individual program. If rural health transformation depends on community infrastructure, and if faith-based organizations constitute the primary community infrastructure in most rural areas, then honest assessment of faith-based capacity becomes essential. The alternative is building transformation strategies on infrastructure that policy documents assume exists but may not.</p>
<h2 id="the-scale-of-faith-based-infrastructure">The Scale of Faith-Based Infrastructure<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-scale-of-faith-based-infrastructure">#</a></h2>
<p>The <strong>National Congregations Study</strong>, the most comprehensive dataset on American religious organizations, reveals both the ubiquity and the fragility of rural church infrastructure.</p>
<p>Approximately <strong>350,000 to 380,000 congregations</strong> operate across the United States, with roughly one-third located in rural areas. This suggests approximately <strong>115,000 to 125,000 rural congregations</strong> serving communities where other organizational infrastructure is often absent. The median congregation has <strong>75 regular participants</strong> and an <strong>annual budget under $100,000</strong>. Rural congregations skew smaller: the typical rural church has <strong>40 to 60 regular attenders</strong> and <strong>annual revenues of $50,000 to $75,000</strong>.</p>
<p>These numbers matter for transformation capacity. A church with 50 members and a $60,000 annual budget can maintain a building, pay a part-time pastor, and organize volunteers. It cannot hire a professional program coordinator, implement federal reporting requirements, or absorb the administrative burden of formal healthcare partnerships. <strong>Scale limitations are not organizational failures; they are structural features of rural religious life.</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>83% of congregations reporting some social service involvement</strong> represents participation, not capacity. This figure from the National Congregations Study includes everything from annual food drives to comprehensive social service programs. Most rural church social service involvement means <strong>volunteers occasionally helping neighbors</strong>, not professional program implementation. The policy-relevant question is not whether churches do social services but whether they can absorb professional healthcare partnership roles.</p>
<h3 id="decline-and-closure-patterns">Decline and Closure Patterns<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#decline-and-closure-patterns">#</a></h3>
<p>Rural church infrastructure is declining. <strong>Approximately 4,000 to 4,500 churches close annually</strong>, with closures concentrated in rural areas and declining denominations. Projections suggest this rate will accelerate as post-World War II church plants reach typical institutional lifespans of 80 to 120 years. Some analysts project <strong>100,000 or more church closures by 2050</strong>, though precise numbers remain uncertain.</p>
<p>The pattern parallels rural community decline more broadly. Young people leave. Membership ages. Giving declines. Buildings deteriorate. Part-time pastors serve multiple congregations. <strong>The infrastructure that RHTP assumes will partner with healthcare systems is itself in crisis.</strong> In the most stressed rural communities, church capacity is declining alongside healthcare access rather than providing a stable base for transformation.</p>
<p>Rural Black congregations face particularly acute infrastructure challenges. Research from the National Congregations Study found that <strong>only 46% of rural Black congregations had any online presence</strong> pre-pandemic, compared to 89% of other congregations. This 43-percentage-point gap reflects broader resource disparities that limit capacity for professional healthcare partnerships regardless of community commitment.</p>
<h2 id="what-faith-based-organizations-actually-do">What Faith-Based Organizations Actually Do<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-faith-based-organizations-actually-do">#</a></h2>
<p>Understanding faith-based transformation capacity requires distinguishing between informal community roles and formal program implementation.</p>
<h3 id="informal-community-functions">Informal Community Functions<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#informal-community-functions">#</a></h3>
<p>Churches serve as <strong>gathering infrastructure</strong> in communities lacking other public spaces. The church building may be the only heated meeting room for miles. Church members constitute <strong>information networks</strong> knowing who is sick, who needs rides, who faces eviction. Pastoral visits provide <strong>health surveillance</strong> identifying unmet needs that clinical systems never see. These functions do not appear in grant applications or program metrics, but they represent genuine community health contributions.</p>
<p><strong>Food assistance</strong> exemplifies informal faith-based health activity. Most rural churches maintain some food ministry, from pantries to community meals to emergency assistance. These programs typically operate on volunteer labor, donated goods, and minimal organization. They address food insecurity without professional nutrition programming, SNAP enrollment assistance, or food-as-medicine coordination that RHTP envisions.</p>
<p><strong>Transportation assistance</strong> similarly operates informally. Church members drive neighbors to appointments, pick up prescriptions, and check on homebound congregants. No scheduling software, volunteer management systems, or liability coverage structures this assistance. It works because people know each other and help each other. Formalizing it into a volunteer driver program with background checks, insurance, and documentation would change its character fundamentally.</p>
<h3 id="formal-program-capacity">Formal Program Capacity<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#formal-program-capacity">#</a></h3>
<p>Some faith-based organizations have developed <strong>professional social service capacity</strong>. These represent the high-capacity end of the spectrum that policy discussions often assume is typical.</p>
<p><strong>Catholic Charities USA</strong> coordinates 177 member agencies providing services to over 8.5 million people annually across more than 2,600 sites. Services span food assistance, housing, health care, immigration support, and disaster relief. Catholic Charities agencies employ professional staff, maintain federal grant compliance capacity, and operate at scales enabling healthcare partnership. However, <strong>Catholic Charities agencies concentrate in urban areas</strong>. Rural Catholic communities typically lack local Catholic Charities presence, leaving parishes without professional social service infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>Lutheran Services in America</strong> leads a network of 300 health and human services organizations serving 6 million people annually in 1,400 communities. The network includes over $23 billion in combined organizational capacity. Lutheran Services organizations provide sophisticated programming in aging services, behavioral health, child welfare, and disability services. Like Catholic Charities, <strong>Lutheran Services capacity concentrates in urban and suburban areas</strong> with limited rural presence relative to rural Lutheran congregations.</p>
<p><strong>Methodist Healthcare Ministries of South Texas</strong> represents exceptional faith-based rural health capacity. The organization invests <strong>$214 million annually</strong> across a 74-county service area, operating the <strong>Wesley Nurse program</strong> with 80+ sites throughout South Texas. Wesley Nurses are registered nurses employed by Methodist Healthcare Ministries but stationed at churches, providing care coordination, health education, and resource navigation for uninsured and underserved populations. Since inception, Methodist Healthcare Ministries has provided over <strong>$1.66 billion in health care services</strong> and represents one of the largest private funding sources for community health care to low-income families in South Texas.</p>
<p>The Methodist Healthcare Ministries model demonstrates what <strong>professionalized faith-based health infrastructure</strong> can achieve. It also demonstrates the resources required: the organization exists because of <strong>unique historical circumstances</strong> creating sustained funding through partnership with HCA Healthcare. Replicating this model requires capital, governance structures, and institutional relationships that most faith communities lack.</p>
<h2 id="the-core-tension-authenticity-versus-institutional-requirements">The Core Tension: Authenticity versus Institutional Requirements<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-core-tension-authenticity-versus-institutional-requirements">#</a></h2>
<p>Faith-based organizations derive value from being embedded in communities, operating informally, and responding to neighbors rather than regulations. Federal program requirements demand formal governance, financial controls, reporting systems, and professional management. <strong>Meeting requirements may destroy authenticity.</strong></p>
<h3 id="the-authenticity-argument">The Authenticity Argument<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-authenticity-argument">#</a></h3>
<p>Churches work as community infrastructure because they are not bureaucratic. The pastor who visits a sick parishioner does not document the encounter for billing purposes. The church member who drives a neighbor to chemotherapy does not complete a transportation log. The deacon who notices a family struggling does not enter a referral into a closed-loop system. <strong>Informal response to community need operates through relationships, not systems.</strong></p>
<p>When churches formalize services, they often lose effectiveness. A church that provides emergency food assistance through informal donation becomes a food pantry with hours, eligibility requirements, and documentation. The informality that allowed immediate response to crisis becomes process that creates barriers. <strong>Professionalization imports the bureaucratic characteristics that made secular services inadequate in the first place.</strong></p>
<p>Faith-based organizations also provide <strong>moral authority</strong> that secular programs cannot replicate. When a pastor encourages health behavior change, the message carries weight that clinical recommendations may lack. When church members support recovery from addiction, they offer spiritual resources alongside social support. <strong>Professionalizing these functions risks severing them from the faith context that makes them effective.</strong></p>
<h3 id="the-institutional-necessity-argument">The Institutional Necessity Argument<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-institutional-necessity-argument">#</a></h3>
<p>Federal funds require accountability. Taxpayers deserve assurance that money reaches intended purposes. The <strong>same informality that enables responsiveness also enables misuse</strong>. Without financial controls, funds can be diverted. Without documentation, outcomes cannot be verified. Without professional management, programs fail despite good intentions.</p>
<p>Faith-based organizations often lack capacity for the administrative work that accountability requires. Small churches with volunteer leadership cannot maintain the record-keeping, reporting, and compliance systems that federal programs demand. <strong>This is not bad faith; it is organizational reality.</strong> Expecting volunteer-led organizations to perform professional administrative functions sets them up for failure.</p>
<p>Moreover, informal assistance often fails to address <strong>structural needs</strong> that transformation requires. A church that helps members navigate healthcare appointments provides valuable service. A church that helps a community implement population health management, social needs screening, and closed-loop referral systems requires different capabilities. <strong>Transformation demands more than informal neighborly assistance scaled up.</strong></p>
<h3 id="evidence-on-the-tension">Evidence on the Tension<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#evidence-on-the-tension">#</a></h3>
<p>The <strong>Faith Community Nursing movement</strong> provides evidence on how faith-based health roles can professionalize while maintaining community connection. Approximately <strong>15,000 registered nurses</strong> practice as faith community nurses (also called parish nurses) in the United States. Only about <strong>35% receive compensation</strong>; most volunteer.</p>
<p>Faith community nursing represents <strong>structured informality</strong>. Nurses bring professional training and credentials while working within faith community contexts. They focus on health promotion, chronic disease management, and care navigation rather than hands-on clinical care. The model <strong>adds professional capacity without replacing community relationships</strong>.</p>
<p>However, faith community nursing also demonstrates <strong>sustainability challenges</strong>. Volunteer-dependent programs struggle with continuity. Compensated positions require funding that most congregations cannot provide. The 80+ Wesley Nurse sites across South Texas exist because Methodist Healthcare Ministries provides employment, supervision, and support infrastructure. <strong>Individual congregations rarely sustain professional faith community nursing independently.</strong></p>

<h3 id="patterns-in-capacity">Patterns in Capacity<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#patterns-in-capacity">#</a></h3>
<p>Several patterns emerge from capacity assessment:</p>
<p><strong>Professional capacity concentrates in health system-affiliated organizations.</strong> Methodist Healthcare Ministries, Catholic health systems with parish nurse programs, and hospital-sponsored faith community nursing networks demonstrate that <strong>substantial healthcare capacity requires institutional support</strong> beyond what individual congregations provide. Independent congregations rarely achieve professional healthcare capacity regardless of community commitment.</p>
<p><strong>Denominational and ecumenical networks can build capacity that individual churches cannot.</strong> The North Carolina Council of Churches Partners in Health and Wholeness program demonstrates network-level capacity building, training CHWs in rural churches and connecting congregations with health departments and hospitals. <strong>Networks aggregate what individual churches cannot sustain.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Local congregations provide community presence, not program capacity.</strong> The typical rural church can offer meeting space, volunteer labor, relationship networks, and moral support. It cannot offer professional program management, federal compliance, or sustained operations independent of volunteer availability. <strong>Expecting otherwise misunderstands organizational reality.</strong></p>
<h2 id="vignette-when-the-hospital-called-the-church">Vignette: When the Hospital Called the Church<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#vignette-when-the-hospital-called-the-church">#</a></h2>
<p><em>The names and some details have been altered, but the situation reflects documented patterns in faith-based rural health partnerships.</em></p>
<p>Mercy Regional Medical Center had a problem. Too many patients discharged from the hospital returned within 30 days, often with preventable complications. Social workers identified that many readmissions involved patients who lived alone, lacked transportation to follow-up appointments, or struggled to afford medications. The hospital needed community partners to support patients after discharge.</p>
<p>Someone suggested partnering with churches. The county had 47 congregations for 18,000 residents. Several churches ran food pantries and visited homebound members. The hospital&rsquo;s mission statement referenced faith-based heritage. Partnership seemed natural.</p>
<p>The community health director called Pastor Linda Martinez at First Baptist, the largest church in town with 200 members. Could the church help with care transitions? Perhaps volunteers could call discharged patients, provide rides to appointments, help with medication pickup?</p>
<p>Pastor Martinez wanted to help. She convened the church&rsquo;s deacon board. Several members volunteered immediately. The church had been helping members navigate healthcare for years. Formalizing the arrangement seemed straightforward.</p>
<p>Then the requirements arrived.</p>
<p><strong>Background checks</strong> for all volunteers who would contact patients. Reasonable, but the church had never run background checks. Cost: $40 per person. Twenty volunteers meant $800 the church had not budgeted.</p>
<p><strong>HIPAA training</strong> for anyone accessing patient information. The hospital offered online modules. Several older volunteers did not have email accounts or internet access at home.</p>
<p><strong>Documentation requirements</strong> for each patient contact. The hospital needed records for compliance. Volunteers would need to complete forms after each call or visit. One deacon asked: &ldquo;If I see Betty Johnson at the grocery store and ask about her knee surgery, do I fill out a form?&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Liability coverage</strong> for volunteer drivers. The church&rsquo;s insurance did not cover volunteers transporting non-members for hospital-related purposes. Adding coverage cost $2,400 annually.</p>
<p><strong>Reporting requirements</strong> quarterly. Patient contacts, outcomes, volunteer hours. Someone would need to compile data. The church had no administrative staff.</p>
<p>The deacon board met again. The requirements made sense individually. Together they transformed neighborly assistance into a professional program the church could not operate. The $3,200 in new costs represented 5% of the church&rsquo;s annual budget. The documentation and reporting would fall to Pastor Martinez, already stretched between two congregations.</p>
<p>First Baptist declined the formal partnership. Church members continued helping informally. Betty Johnson still got rides from her Sunday School class. The deacon still visited her at home. None of it counted in the hospital&rsquo;s community benefit reporting.</p>
<p>The hospital found a partner in the regional Area Agency on Aging, which had professional staff, existing compliance systems, and infrastructure for the work. The partnership succeeded on paper. But the Agency served the whole region and had limited presence in town. <strong>The community connection that churches provided remained outside the formal system.</strong></p>
<p>Pastor Martinez wondered what might have been different. Could the hospital have provided funding for background checks and insurance? Could documentation requirements have been simplified for volunteer-led programs? Could the partnership have built on what the church already did rather than requiring the church to become something different?</p>
<p>She did not have answers. She had a congregation to serve, a food pantry to stock, and homebound members to visit. <strong>The informal work continued without formal recognition or institutional support.</strong></p>
<h2 id="alternative-perspectives">Alternative Perspectives<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#alternative-perspectives">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="the-secularization-argument">The Secularization Argument<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-secularization-argument">#</a></h3>
<p>Some analysts argue that <strong>faith-based organizations should not be central to public health infrastructure</strong> regardless of their current presence. Public programs should not depend on religious institutions. Relying on churches for health transformation creates problems:</p>
<p><strong>Exclusion risks</strong>: Faith-based organizations may serve their own members preferentially. LGBTQ+ individuals, religious minorities, and secular community members may face unwelcome environments or explicit discrimination. Public health infrastructure should be universally accessible.</p>
<p><strong>Proselytization concerns</strong>: Some faith-based organizations view service provision as evangelism opportunity. Recipients of assistance may feel pressure to participate in religious activities or express religious beliefs. Health services should not come with religious strings.</p>
<p><strong>Sustainability problems</strong>: Church decline makes faith-based infrastructure unreliable for long-term programs. Building public health capacity on declining organizations creates future gaps when churches close.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment</strong>: These concerns have validity. Some faith-based organizations do discriminate. Some do proselytize. Many are declining. However, <strong>dismissing faith-based infrastructure ignores organizational reality in rural communities</strong>. Where churches are the only functioning community organizations, secular alternatives do not exist to substitute. The practical question is not whether to use faith-based infrastructure but how to do so while managing real concerns about access, coercion, and sustainability.</p>
<h3 id="the-capacity-building-argument">The Capacity Building Argument<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-capacity-building-argument">#</a></h3>
<p>Others argue that <strong>faith-based organizations can develop professional capacity</strong> with appropriate investment. The Duke Endowment&rsquo;s work in North Carolina demonstrates intentional capacity building:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Partners in Health and Wholeness</strong> (NC Council of Churches) connects rural churches with health departments for CHW training</li>
<li><strong>NC State Institute for Emerging Issues</strong> helps congregations use data for community engagement planning</li>
<li><strong>38 churches</strong> have developed data-driven action plans for community health</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach treats faith-based capacity as <strong>developmental rather than fixed</strong>. Rather than assuming churches either have capacity or do not, it invests in building capacity where potential exists. The investment includes training, technical assistance, and connection to institutional partners who provide infrastructure individual churches lack.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment</strong>: Capacity building can work, but it requires sustained investment that RHTP timelines may not allow. Building professional capacity in volunteer-led organizations takes years, not months. States facing pressure to show transformation progress may not have time for faith-based capacity development. Moreover, <strong>capacity building changes organizations</strong>. Churches that develop professional program capacity may lose the informal community embeddedness that made them valuable initially.</p>
<h3 id="the-parallel-infrastructure-argument">The Parallel Infrastructure Argument<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-parallel-infrastructure-argument">#</a></h3>
<p>A third perspective suggests <strong>faith-based and formal healthcare infrastructure should operate in parallel</strong> rather than integrating. Churches continue informal community health support. Healthcare systems operate professional programs. The two interact through referrals and relationships without expecting churches to become program implementers.</p>
<p>This approach preserves what churches do well: <strong>community presence, moral support, relationship networks, informal assistance</strong>. It does not burden volunteer organizations with professional requirements they cannot meet. Healthcare systems benefit from community intelligence and referrals without depending on church capacity for program delivery.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment</strong>: Parallel operation may be realistic for most rural churches. However, it also means <strong>transformation programs cannot count on church capacity</strong> for implementation. If community-based transformation requires community organizations to implement programs, and if churches cannot be those implementers, then transformation depends on building alternative community infrastructure or accepting more limited community engagement.</p>
<h2 id="when-faith-based-organizations-can-support-transformation">When Faith-Based Organizations Can Support Transformation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#when-faith-based-organizations-can-support-transformation">#</a></h2>
<p>Faith-based organizations can contribute to rural health transformation under specific conditions:</p>
<p><strong>When roles match actual capacity.</strong> Churches with volunteer leadership and modest budgets can provide meeting space, community connection, moral support, and informal assistance. They cannot provide professional program management. <strong>Matching roles to capacity prevents both organizational harm and program failure.</strong></p>
<p><strong>When institutional partners provide infrastructure.</strong> The Wesley Nurse model works because Methodist Healthcare Ministries employs the nurses, provides supervision, and maintains compliance systems. Churches provide community presence and relationships. <strong>The institutional partner handles what individual congregations cannot.</strong></p>
<p><strong>When networks aggregate individual church contributions.</strong> Denominational networks, councils of churches, and ecumenical coalitions can coordinate activities across multiple congregations, provide training and technical assistance, and interface with healthcare systems on behalf of member churches. <strong>Networks can achieve collectively what individual churches cannot sustain alone.</strong></p>
<p><strong>When professionalization respects community context.</strong> Faith community nursing demonstrates that professional roles can operate within faith contexts without destroying community connection. The key is <strong>adding professional capacity to existing relationships</strong> rather than replacing relationships with professional structures.</p>
<p><strong>When investment precedes expectation.</strong> Capacity building requires resources before programs launch. Churches cannot develop compliance systems after receiving grants. <strong>Investment in capacity development must precede expectations for program implementation.</strong></p>
<h2 id="when-faith-based-organizations-cannot-support-transformation">When Faith-Based Organizations Cannot Support Transformation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#when-faith-based-organizations-cannot-support-transformation">#</a></h2>
<p>Some situations exceed faith-based organizational capacity regardless of commitment:</p>
<p><strong>When professional program management is required.</strong> Federal compliance, outcome documentation, data systems, and continuous quality improvement require professional staff time. Volunteer-led organizations cannot provide this consistently. <strong>Expecting professional management from volunteer organizations guarantees failure.</strong></p>
<p><strong>When the church itself is declining.</strong> Congregations losing members, reducing budgets, and considering closure cannot take on new program responsibilities. <strong>Adding transformation burden to declining organizations accelerates their decline</strong> without achieving transformation goals.</p>
<p><strong>When the required scale exceeds congregational scope.</strong> Individual churches serve individual communities. Population health management, regional care coordination, and systematic social needs integration operate at scales that individual congregations cannot address. <strong>Transformation at scale requires organizational capacity at scale.</strong></p>
<p><strong>When sustainability depends on continued grant funding.</strong> Churches that build RHTP-funded programs may be unable to sustain them when funding ends in 2030. If the church cannot continue the work independently, <strong>the program represents temporary service expansion rather than transformation.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Develop multiple community partnerships</strong> rather than depending on any single church. Individual congregations change, decline, or close. Diversified partnerships provide resilience.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Assess capacity honestly</strong> before accepting formal partnership roles. The desire to help does not create the capacity to help. Overcommitment harms both organizations and communities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Seek roles that match actual capacity.</strong> Providing meeting space, community connection, and informal support are legitimate contributions. Not every partnership requires program implementation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Participate in capacity-building networks</strong> that provide training, technical assistance, and institutional support. Individual churches benefit from collective infrastructure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Protect organizational identity</strong> within partnerships. Healthcare partnerships should strengthen, not replace, faith community roles. Churches that become social service agencies may lose what made them effective.</p>
