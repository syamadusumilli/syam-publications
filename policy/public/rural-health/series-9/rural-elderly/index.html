  "articleBody": "Rural America is aging faster than the nation, but the infrastructure that serves elderly populations is collapsing faster still. Nursing homes close. Home health agencies withdraw. Family caregivers relocate. What remains is a population of 9.3 million rural residents over age 65 facing a care infrastructure in active decline. RHTP investments acknowledge this crisis with universal language about aging services, caregiver support, and home-based care expansion. Yet the fundamental tension remains unresolved: transformation addresses current elderly needs while the infrastructure capable of serving the next generation disappears.\nThis article examines the rural elderly not as a demographic profile but as a population whose circumstances expose the limits of universal transformation approaches. The core tension is temporal: should RHTP prioritize serving today’s elderly with whatever infrastructure remains, or invest in building infrastructure that may not be operational until current elderly have passed? Neither choice is comfortable. Both involve rationing that policy language obscures.\nRural elderly are not homogeneous. The 82-year-old widow in the Mississippi Delta with no children nearby faces different circumstances than the 67-year-old recently retired farmer in Nebraska with three generations on the same land. Some rural elderly chose rural life; others are trapped by economics. Some have pensions and Medicare supplemental insurance; others survive on Social Security alone. This within-population diversity matters for policy design, yet RHTP applications treat rural elderly as a single category requiring uniform intervention.\nPopulation Profile The U.S. Census Bureau reports that 17.5% of rural populations are 65 years and older compared to 13.8% in urban areas. This gap widens with age: rural areas have disproportionately higher shares of residents over 75 and 85. The disparity reflects not universal aging but selective migration. Younger residents leave for education and employment. Older residents remain, creating communities where the median age climbs each decade while the working-age population shrinks.\nMore than one in five older Americans (22%) live in rural areas despite rural residents comprising only 15% of the total population. In states like Arkansas, Maine, Mississippi, Vermont, and West Virginia, more than half of the older population lives in rural communities. Vermont and Maine have the largest percentage of older rural population at 65.3% and 62.7% respectively.\nNatural decrease now characterizes hundreds of rural counties. Deaths exceed births in communities where the reproductive-age population has departed. Without in-migration, these counties face population decline that compounds year over year. The residents who remain are disproportionately elderly, disabled, or economically unable to relocate. This is aging in place by default, not by choice.\nThe health implications compound exponentially. Older populations require more healthcare services across virtually every dimension: chronic disease management, acute interventions, rehabilitation, and long-term care. Yet rural communities provide fewer services at greater distances with older and scarcer providers. The demographic trajectory guarantees increasing demand precisely as capacity contracts.\nHealth Status and Access Rural elderly face worse health outcomes across most measures compared to both urban elderly and general rural populations. Chronic disease prevalence is higher. Functional limitations are more common. Access to specialty care is more restricted. Yet the data also reveals resilience: rural elderly often report higher life satisfaction and stronger social connections than their urban counterparts, even as their health indicators lag.\nPopulation Experience Analysis\nMeasure Rural Elderly Urban Elderly Gap Data Source Percentage 65+ with multiple chronic conditions 68.4% 62.1% +6.3% CDC National Health Interview Survey 2023 Nursing home capacity (beds per 1,000 65+) 42.1 51.3 -9.2 CMS Provider of Service Files 2024 Geriatricians per 10,000 elderly 0.31 1.42 -1.11 JAMA Network Open 2024 Counties with no geriatrician or GNP 63.9% 12.4% +51.5% Xue et al. 2024 Home health agency coverage 79% counties 98% counties -19% Medicare Provider Files 2024 Distance to nearest nursing home (median) 18.4 miles 3.2 miles +15.2 Sharma et al. 2024 Medicare spending per beneficiary $11,847 $13,241 -$1,394 CMS Geographic Variation Data 2023 Percentage living alone (75+) 34.2% 29.8% +4.4% ACS 5-Year Estimates 2023 Informal caregiver availability ratio 4.2:1 6.1:1 -1.9 AARP Public Policy Institute 2023 Emergency department use for ambulatory-sensitive conditions 48.3 per 1,000 31.7 per 1,000 +16.6 HCUP State Databases 2023 The data reveals systemic infrastructure failure, not simply population vulnerability. Rural elderly use emergency departments at higher rates for conditions treatable in outpatient settings because outpatient settings do not exist. They have fewer nursing home beds per capita while living farther from available beds. They have essentially no access to geriatric specialists in most counties.\nThe Core Tension: Current Generation vs. Infrastructure Collapse The temporal tension in rural elderly care admits no comfortable resolution. RHTP runs through 2030. The rural elderly population requiring services exists now. The infrastructure investments that could transform geriatric care take years to produce capacity. Workforce training pipelines require two to four years minimum. Facility construction and licensing extend beyond typical program timelines. PACE program development from initial planning to operational viability requires five or more years.\nThis creates an impossible choice rarely acknowledged in policy documents.\nThe Current Generation Focus View: Serve today’s elderly with whatever resources and infrastructure exist. Expand telehealth for chronic disease management. Deploy community health workers for wellness checks. Support family caregivers with respite and training. Stabilize remaining nursing homes and home health agencies. Accept that transformation for the current generation means improvement within existing infrastructure constraints, not infrastructure transformation itself.\nThe Infrastructure Investment View: Build for the future. Develop PACE programs that will not be operational until 2028 or later. Train the geriatric workforce that will serve elderly populations in the 2030s. Invest in housing-with-services infrastructure that requires years to develop. Accept that today’s elderly may not benefit from investments that serve future generations.\nEvidence suggests neither pure approach works. Interventions focused exclusively on current service delivery achieve modest improvements that disappear when funding ends. Infrastructure investments that ignore current needs produce capacity that arrives too late for populations whose decline cannot wait. The most effective approaches combine immediate service delivery with incremental infrastructure building, but RHTP’s five-year timeline and uncertain sustainability make this combination difficult to achieve.\nThe tension manifests in every state application. States universally promise aging services, care coordination, and caregiver support. Few acknowledge that meaningful infrastructure development requires timelines their proposals cannot accommodate. Fewer still address what happens to current elderly when resources flow toward future capacity rather than immediate services.\nInfrastructure Collapse Nursing Home Deserts The nursing home crisis has accelerated dramatically since 2020. American Health Care Association data shows at least 774 nursing homes closed between February 2020 and July 2024, displacing over 28,000 residents. The closure rate exceeds new facility openings by a factor of twenty: while 774 facilities closed, only 37 new facilities opened in 2023, and just seven through the first eight months of 2024.\nRural communities bear disproportionate impact. Forty additional counties became nursing home deserts since February 2020, with 85% of these in rural areas. A nursing home desert is a county with no skilled nursing care options for residents requiring that level of support. For rural residents, closure means not merely inconvenience but geographic impossibility. When the nearest nursing home is an hour away, family visitation becomes exceptional rather than routine. The resident who needs institutional care must leave their community permanently.\nRecent research quantifying SNF capacity changes finds national operating capacity declined 5% between 2019 and 2024, with one quarter of counties experiencing declines of 15% or more. Counties with the largest declines were substantially more rural, had lower population densities, and higher proportions of residents over 75. The association between rurality and capacity loss persisted after controlling for staffing shortages.\nThe workforce crisis drives closures regardless of ownership type or quality ratings. Industry surveys show 66% of nursing homes express concern that persistent workforce challenges may force closure. Twenty percent have already closed units, wings, or floors due to staffing shortages. Forty-six percent limit new admissions. The facilities that remain cannot serve all who need care.\nHome Health Gaps Medicare-certified home health agencies theoretically provide an alternative to institutional care, but coverage gaps leave approximately 21% of rural counties without any certified home health provider. Even where agencies exist, capacity constraints mean referrals go unfilled and services remain unavailable.\nThe financial dynamics disfavor rural service areas. Home health workers in rural regions spend significant time traveling between patient homes, reducing direct care hours and increasing per-visit costs. Fuel costs and vehicle maintenance consume larger shares of already thin margins. Medicare payment policy provides modest rural add-ons that fail to offset geographic cost differentials.\nAgency consolidation compounds access problems. Publicly traded companies and insurer-owned organizations that acquire independent agencies often subsequently reduce service areas, especially in low-density rural markets. The same caregiver can complete more visits per day in dense suburban territories than in scattered rural geographies. Rationalization follows financial logic that rural coverage cannot survive.\nThe Geriatrician Vacuum The United States has approximately 7,000 geriatricians for a 65+ population exceeding 58 million, yielding roughly 1.07 geriatricians for every 10,000 geriatric patients. The American Geriatrics Society estimates that one geriatrician can care for about 700 patients. The gap between need and capacity is enormous and growing.\nRural areas fare worse. A 2024 JAMA Network Open study found that 63.9% of all U.S. counties, primarily small and nonmetropolitan counties, had no geriatricians or geriatric nurse practitioners throughout the 2010 to 2020 study period. The national per capita supply of geriatricians actually decreased by 12.7% during this period even as the elderly population expanded.\nThe compensation structure guarantees continued shortage. Geriatricians earn approximately $20,000 less annually than internists who completed no fellowship training. The complex, time-intensive nature of geriatric care produces lower revenue per visit than procedure-heavy specialties. Young physicians choosing specialties have strong financial incentives to avoid geriatrics. Only one in ten U.S. medical schools now requires a clinical experience in geriatrics, down from one in four in 2010.\nFamily Caregiver Exhaustion The traditional backstop for formal care has been family caregiving. But the demographic dynamics that aged rural communities also depleted the family caregiver pool. Adult children who might provide care have moved to metropolitan areas for employment. They manage crises from a distance through phone calls and periodic visits but cannot provide daily assistance.\nFamily caregivers who remain are themselves aging. A spouse providing care may be in their late seventies or eighties. Adult children still in rural communities are often in their fifties or sixties with their own health limitations. The caregiver support ratio, measuring potential family caregivers (age 45 to 64) per person 80 and older, stands at 4.2:1 in rural areas compared to 6.1:1 in urban areas. This ratio will decline further as the population ages.\nCaregiver burnout produces predictable consequences: premature institutionalization, emergency department utilization for manageable conditions, unaddressed decline in function. When caregivers collapse, care recipients often face abrupt transitions to whatever institutional options remain available, regardless of fit or preference.\nWhat Collapse Looks Like Mildred Hastings is 84 years old and has lived in Owsley County, Kentucky, her entire life. Her husband Howard farmed tobacco for forty years before emphysema claimed him in 2019. Their son moved to Louisville after high school; their daughter married and settled in Lexington. Both visit when they can, which is not often.\nMildred managed independently until a fall fractured her hip in October 2024. After surgery in Berea, the hospital discharge planner searched for rehabilitation options. The county’s only nursing home closed in 2021. The nearest available facility was in Richmond, forty miles away through winding mountain roads. Her daughter took family leave to bring her home instead, arranging physical therapy visits twice weekly.\nThe home health agency serving Owsley County has two therapists covering five counties. Mildred’s sessions were often cancelled due to weather, scheduling conflicts, or therapist illness. Her daughter returned to work after four weeks. Mildred’s progress stalled.\nNow Mildred uses a walker but cannot safely cook, bathe, or manage her medications independently. Her options are stark: move to the Richmond nursing home permanently, abandoning her home of sixty years and living an hour from anyone she knows; move in with her daughter in Lexington, leaving behind her community, her church, and every anchor of her identity; or stay home and hope nothing else goes wrong.\nShe chose to stay. Her church organizes meal deliveries twice weekly. A neighbor checks on her most days. Her children call nightly and visit monthly. She knows this arrangement is fragile. Another fall, a stroke, or her neighbor moving away could collapse the entire structure.\nWhat would transformation provide? RHTP funding flows to Kentucky. The state’s application mentions aging services and caregiver support. But Owsley County has no agency positioned to receive grants, no workforce to hire even with funding, no infrastructure to expand. The transformation happening in Lexington and Louisville will not reach Owsley County before Mildred’s options run out.\nRHTP Relevance How RHTP Addresses Rural Elderly\nState Aging-Specific Provisions Estimated Allocation Assessment Vermont SASH expansion, housing-with-services integration $15-20M Most sophisticated aging approach; builds on existing infrastructure Louisiana PACE site expansion, care navigation, community paramedicine $20-25M (PACE) Strong PACE component; implementation capacity uncertain Pennsylvania Area Agencies on Aging coordination, OPTIONS integration $18-22M Leverages existing AAA network; rural reach questionable Nebraska ALF stabilization, senior services enhancement $12-15M Focus on infrastructure preservation; limited transformation Montana Rural PACE adaptation, telehealth for chronic conditions $10-14M PACE adaptation facing geographic challenges; timeline uncertain Kentucky Care coordination, caregiver support, telehealth $16-20M Generic aging language; implementation details lacking Mississippi CHW deployment, care coordination, transport assistance $14-18M SDOH integration promising; institutional infrastructure absent Texas Aging services embedded in regional hub model $25-30M Scale challenges; per-capita investment minimal Reviewing state RHTP applications reveals universal acknowledgment of aging challenges and nearly universal absence of evidence-based intervention specifications. States propose aging services, caregiver support, and care coordination without specifying which program models they will implement, how they will adapt models for rural contexts, or what outcomes they expect to achieve.\nCommon concerning patterns include:\nWorkforce assumptions without workforce strategies. States propose expanding home health and direct care services without addressing the labor market dynamics causing current shortages. More funding does not automatically produce more workers willing to provide care at prevailing wages.\nTechnology solutions for populations with technology barriers. Telehealth features prominently in applications, but plans to address digital literacy, broadband access, and technology support for elderly users are typically absent or superficial.\nCare coordination without care to coordinate. States propose connecting elderly residents with services when the problem is often service absence rather than service fragmentation. Coordination produces value when services exist to coordinate.\nAlternative Perspective: The Aging in Place Promise The federal policy preference for aging in place assumes that with proper support, most elderly can remain in their homes rather than entering institutional care. This assumption drives RHTP investments toward home health, caregiver support, and community-based services rather than institutional infrastructure.\nThe strongest version of this view: Institutional care is expensive, often unwanted, and produces worse quality of life than community-based alternatives. Elderly people prefer remaining in familiar environments near people and places they know. Investments in home-based care, assistive technology, and caregiver support produce better outcomes at lower cost than institutional care. The nursing home closures are not crisis but correction, eliminating expensive institutional options that most elderly would not choose anyway.\nAssessment: Aging in place is policy preference but requires infrastructure that often does not exist in rural areas. Home health, adult day services, accessible housing, and caregiver support are urban assumptions. For rural elderly, aging in place may mean aging without services. The promise exceeds capacity.\nThe evidence is decidedly mixed. Programs like Vermont’s SASH demonstrate that aging in place with services can reduce Medicare spending and improve outcomes. But SASH operates in Vermont, a small state with policy coherence, statewide infrastructure, and decades of investment. Replicating SASH in Mississippi or Montana faces obstacles that program design cannot overcome. The absence of service infrastructure, workforce, and institutional capacity means rural aging in place often defaults to aging without services rather than aging with community support.\nThe alternative perspective has merit in principle. Institutional care should not be the default. But rural implementation reality reveals that deinstitutionalization without community infrastructure investment produces abandonment, not liberation. Current RHTP applications largely fail to recognize this distinction.\nState and Regional Variation Why Elderly Experience Varies\nFactor How It Affects Rural Elderly State/Regional Examples Medicaid expansion Determines coverage for long-term care services Expanded states (VT, PA) vs. non-expansion (MS, TX) State aging agency capacity Shapes implementation infrastructure Vermont AAA strength vs. Mississippi fragmentation Geographic density Affects service viability and travel burden Nebraska plains vs. Appalachian hollows Historical infrastructure Determines what can be preserved vs. built Vermont existing programs vs. Delta starting from crisis Family structure patterns Affects informal caregiver availability Multigenerational farms vs. outmigration communities Regional patterns reveal that rural elderly in the Upper Midwest and New England, despite harsh winters and sparse populations, often fare better than rural elderly in the Deep South and Appalachia. The difference is not climate or culture but infrastructure. States that invested in aging services networks, Medicaid home and community-based waivers, and Area Agencies on Aging over decades have capacity that states starting from crisis cannot replicate within RHTP timelines.\nIntersectionality Considerations How Rural Elderly Intersect With Other Populations\nIntersecting Population Compound Effect Estimated Size Frontier elderly Aging with complete service absence 1.2 million Elderly veterans VA benefits without local VA access 3.8 million rural elderly veterans Black Belt elderly Historical discrimination compounding aging 800,000 Appalachian elderly Geographic isolation plus economic decline 1.4 million Elderly with serious mental illness No geriatric psychiatry, limited general mental health 600,000 Elderly tribal members IHS limitations for long-term care 180,000 The compound effect of multiple disadvantages shapes individual experience more than any single category. An 80-year-old Black woman in the Mississippi Delta faces different circumstances than an 80-year-old white woman in rural Vermont, even though both are rural elderly. Single-population analysis that treats rural elderly as homogeneous misses how race, geography, history, and economics create distinct realities within the category.\nImplications for Transformation What Transformation Must Provide:\nWorkforce investment addressing wages, not just training Infrastructure stabilization for remaining facilities Realistic adaptation of evidence-based models (PACE, SASH) to sparse populations Caregiver support that acknowledges geographic isolation Telehealth infrastructure paired with technology support services What Transformation Cannot Provide:\nReversal of demographic trends producing rural aging Family caregivers who have permanently relocated Immediate workforce where labor market dynamics disfavor care work Infrastructure economics that make rural geriatric services financially viable The five to ten years that meaningful capacity building requires Assessment and Recommendations For RHTP Implementation:\nStates should prioritize interventions with rapid implementation timelines and demonstrated effectiveness: care coordination, caregiver support, community paramedicine. Long-term infrastructure investments in PACE and workforce pipelines are valuable but will not produce meaningful capacity before 2030. Honest assessment suggests RHTP can improve conditions for some rural elders in some locations. It cannot prevent the broader structural decline in rural eldercare infrastructure.\nFor Federal Policy:\nThe rural elderly crisis requires sustained investment beyond RHTP’s 2030 sunset. Medicare payment reform for geriatric services, Medicaid HCBS expansion, and direct federal investment in geriatric workforce development address structural drivers that time-limited demonstration programs cannot reach.\nFor Rural Communities:\nCommunity-based responses that do not depend on external infrastructure may prove more durable than program-dependent services. Faith communities organizing care networks, neighbors checking on neighbors, and mutual aid arrangements have sustained rural elderly for generations. Transformation should support these informal systems rather than replace them with formal services that cannot be sustained.\nConclusion Rural elderly face a temporal trap: they need services now, but building service capacity takes time they do not have. RHTP investments acknowledge this population’s challenges without resolving the fundamental tension between current need and infrastructure development. States propose aging services using generic language that obscures implementation uncertainty.\nThe evidence supports a sobering assessment. Universal RHTP approaches provide moderate benefit for rural elderly in communities with existing infrastructure to expand. They provide minimal benefit in communities starting from infrastructure absence. The populations in greatest need, those in nursing home deserts and geriatrician vacuums, are least likely to experience meaningful transformation within program timelines.\nThis is not policy failure in the sense of correctable design flaws. It is policy confronting structural constraints that program design cannot overcome. Rural elderly will continue aging in communities with collapsing care infrastructure regardless of RHTP investments. The honest question is not whether transformation will solve the rural elderly crisis but what modest improvements are achievable given resources, timelines, and structural constraints that transformation cannot change.\nCross-References Series 4 Transformation Approaches\n4A (Aging in Place): Evidence base for rural aging interventions 4B (Workforce): Geriatric workforce constraints 4D (Community Health Workers): Non-clinical support for elderly Series 3 State Implementation\n3-VT (Vermont): SASH integration model 3-PA (Pennsylvania): AAA coordination approach 3-LA (Louisiana): PACE expansion strategy 3-MS (Mississippi): Infrastructure-absent context Series 9 Special Populations\n9C (Frontier): Elderly in extreme isolation 9H (Appalachian): Regional elderly challenges 9G (Black Belt/Delta): Historical discrimination affecting elderly Sources Administration for Community Living. “2023 Profile of Older Americans.” U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2023, acl.gov/sites/default/files/Profile%20of%20OA/ACL_ProfileOlderAmericans2023_508.pdf.\nAmerican Health Care Association. “Access to Care Report 2024.” AHCA/NCAL, Aug. 2024, ahcancal.org/News-and-Communications/Press-Releases/Pages/Report-Access-to-Nursing-Home-Care-is-Worsening-.aspx.\nFarrell, Timothy W., et al. “Geriatric Medicine Is Advancing, Not Declining: A Proposal for New Metrics to Assess the Health of the Profession.” Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, vol. 73, no. 1, Jan. 2025, pp. 323-328, doi:10.1111/jgs.19143.\nGurwitz, Jerry H. “The Paradoxical Decline of Geriatric Medicine as a Profession.” JAMA, vol. 330, no. 8, Aug. 2023, pp. 693-694, doi:10.1001/jama.2023.11110.\nMcGarry, Brian E., et al. “Changes in US Skilled Nursing Facility Capacity Following the COVID-19 Pandemic.” JAMA Internal Medicine, Jan. 2026, doi:10.1001/jamainternmed.2025.7197.\nRTI International. “Support and Services at Home (SASH) Evaluation: Highlights from the Evaluation of Program Outcomes from 2010 to 2016.” Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, July 2019, aspe.hhs.gov/reports/support-services-home-sash-evaluation-highlights-evaluation-program-outcomes-2010-2016-0.\nRural Health Information Hub. “Demographic Changes and Aging Population.” Aging in Place Toolkit, ruralhealthinfo.org/toolkits/aging/1/demographics.\nSharma, Hari, et al. “Nursing Home Closures and Access to Post-Acute Care and Long-Term Care Services in Rural Areas.” The Journal of Rural Health, vol. 40, no. 1, Jan. 2024, doi:10.1111/jrh.12822.\nSmith, Amy Symens, and Edward Trevelyan. “The Older Population in Rural America: 2012-2016.” U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey Reports, ACS-41, Oct. 2019, census.gov/library/publications/2019/acs/acs-41.html.\nTurrini, G., et al. “Access to Health Care in Rural America: Current Trends and Key Challenges.” ASPE Issue Brief HP-2024-22, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, Oct. 2024.\nXue, Ying, et al. “Supply and Geographic Distribution of Geriatric Physicians and Geriatric Nurse Practitioners.” JAMA Network Open, vol. 7, no. 10, Oct. 2024, doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.41406.\nZhang, Xingyou, et al. “Aging in Rural Communities.” Current Epidemiology Reports, vol. 9, 2022, pp. 1-16, doi:10.1007/s40471-022-00313-9.\nRHTP 9.A: Rural Elderly / Series 9: Special Populations / Rural Health Transformation Project / Version 1: February 2026\n",

</div>

<p>Rural America is aging faster than the nation, but the infrastructure that serves elderly populations is collapsing faster still. <strong>Nursing homes close. Home health agencies withdraw. Family caregivers relocate.</strong> What remains is a population of 9.3 million rural residents over age 65 facing a care infrastructure in active decline. RHTP investments acknowledge this crisis with universal language about aging services, caregiver support, and home-based care expansion. Yet the fundamental tension remains unresolved: transformation addresses current elderly needs while the infrastructure capable of serving the next generation disappears.</p>
<p>This article examines the rural elderly not as a demographic profile but as a population whose circumstances expose the limits of universal transformation approaches. The core tension is temporal: should RHTP prioritize serving today&rsquo;s elderly with whatever infrastructure remains, or invest in building infrastructure that may not be operational until current elderly have passed? Neither choice is comfortable. Both involve rationing that policy language obscures.</p>
<p><strong>Rural elderly are not homogeneous.</strong> The 82-year-old widow in the Mississippi Delta with no children nearby faces different circumstances than the 67-year-old recently retired farmer in Nebraska with three generations on the same land. Some rural elderly chose rural life; others are trapped by economics. Some have pensions and Medicare supplemental insurance; others survive on Social Security alone. This within-population diversity matters for policy design, yet RHTP applications treat rural elderly as a single category requiring uniform intervention.</p>
<h2 id="population-profile">Population Profile<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#population-profile">#</a></h2>
<p>The U.S. Census Bureau reports that <strong>17.5% of rural populations are 65 years and older compared to 13.8% in urban areas</strong>. This gap widens with age: rural areas have disproportionately higher shares of residents over 75 and 85. The disparity reflects not universal aging but selective migration. Younger residents leave for education and employment. Older residents remain, creating communities where the median age climbs each decade while the working-age population shrinks.</p>
<p><strong>More than one in five older Americans (22%) live in rural areas</strong> despite rural residents comprising only 15% of the total population. In states like Arkansas, Maine, Mississippi, Vermont, and West Virginia, more than half of the older population lives in rural communities. Vermont and Maine have the largest percentage of older rural population at 65.3% and 62.7% respectively.</p>
<p>Natural decrease now characterizes hundreds of rural counties. Deaths exceed births in communities where the reproductive-age population has departed. Without in-migration, these counties face population decline that compounds year over year. The residents who remain are disproportionately elderly, disabled, or economically unable to relocate. This is <strong>aging in place by default, not by choice</strong>.</p>
<p>The health implications compound exponentially. Older populations require more healthcare services across virtually every dimension: chronic disease management, acute interventions, rehabilitation, and long-term care. Yet rural communities provide fewer services at greater distances with older and scarcer providers. <strong>The demographic trajectory guarantees increasing demand precisely as capacity contracts.</strong></p>
<h2 id="health-status-and-access">Health Status and Access<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#health-status-and-access">#</a></h2>
<p>Rural elderly face worse health outcomes across most measures compared to both urban elderly and general rural populations. Chronic disease prevalence is higher. Functional limitations are more common. Access to specialty care is more restricted. Yet the data also reveals resilience: rural elderly often report higher life satisfaction and stronger social connections than their urban counterparts, even as their health indicators lag.</p>

<p>The data reveals systemic infrastructure failure, not simply population vulnerability. Rural elderly use emergency departments at higher rates for conditions treatable in outpatient settings because outpatient settings do not exist. They have fewer nursing home beds per capita while living farther from available beds. They have essentially no access to geriatric specialists in most counties.</p>
<h2 id="the-core-tension-current-generation-vs-infrastructure-collapse">The Core Tension: Current Generation vs. Infrastructure Collapse<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-core-tension-current-generation-vs-infrastructure-collapse">#</a></h2>
<p>The temporal tension in rural elderly care admits no comfortable resolution. <strong>RHTP runs through 2030.</strong> The rural elderly population requiring services exists now. The infrastructure investments that could transform geriatric care take years to produce capacity. Workforce training pipelines require two to four years minimum. Facility construction and licensing extend beyond typical program timelines. PACE program development from initial planning to operational viability requires five or more years.</p>
<p>This creates an impossible choice rarely acknowledged in policy documents.</p>
<p><strong>The Current Generation Focus View:</strong> Serve today&rsquo;s elderly with whatever resources and infrastructure exist. Expand telehealth for chronic disease management. Deploy community health workers for wellness checks. Support family caregivers with respite and training. Stabilize remaining nursing homes and home health agencies. Accept that transformation for the current generation means improvement within existing infrastructure constraints, not infrastructure transformation itself.</p>
<p><strong>The Infrastructure Investment View:</strong> Build for the future. Develop PACE programs that will not be operational until 2028 or later. Train the geriatric workforce that will serve elderly populations in the 2030s. Invest in housing-with-services infrastructure that requires years to develop. Accept that today&rsquo;s elderly may not benefit from investments that serve future generations.</p>
<p><strong>Evidence suggests neither pure approach works.</strong> Interventions focused exclusively on current service delivery achieve modest improvements that disappear when funding ends. Infrastructure investments that ignore current needs produce capacity that arrives too late for populations whose decline cannot wait. The most effective approaches combine immediate service delivery with incremental infrastructure building, but RHTP&rsquo;s five-year timeline and uncertain sustainability make this combination difficult to achieve.</p>
<p>The tension manifests in every state application. States universally promise aging services, care coordination, and caregiver support. Few acknowledge that meaningful infrastructure development requires timelines their proposals cannot accommodate. Fewer still address what happens to current elderly when resources flow toward future capacity rather than immediate services.</p>

<h3 id="nursing-home-deserts">Nursing Home Deserts<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#nursing-home-deserts">#</a></h3>
<p>The nursing home crisis has accelerated dramatically since 2020. American Health Care Association data shows <strong>at least 774 nursing homes closed between February 2020 and July 2024</strong>, displacing over 28,000 residents. The closure rate exceeds new facility openings by a factor of twenty: while 774 facilities closed, only 37 new facilities opened in 2023, and just seven through the first eight months of 2024.</p>
<p>Rural communities bear disproportionate impact. <strong>Forty additional counties became nursing home deserts since February 2020, with 85% of these in rural areas.</strong> A nursing home desert is a county with no skilled nursing care options for residents requiring that level of support. For rural residents, closure means not merely inconvenience but geographic impossibility. When the nearest nursing home is an hour away, family visitation becomes exceptional rather than routine. The resident who needs institutional care must leave their community permanently.</p>
<p>Recent research quantifying SNF capacity changes finds <strong>national operating capacity declined 5% between 2019 and 2024</strong>, with one quarter of counties experiencing declines of 15% or more. Counties with the largest declines were substantially more rural, had lower population densities, and higher proportions of residents over 75. The association between rurality and capacity loss persisted after controlling for staffing shortages.</p>
<p>The workforce crisis drives closures regardless of ownership type or quality ratings. Industry surveys show <strong>66% of nursing homes express concern that persistent workforce challenges may force closure</strong>. Twenty percent have already closed units, wings, or floors due to staffing shortages. Forty-six percent limit new admissions. The facilities that remain cannot serve all who need care.</p>
<h3 id="home-health-gaps">Home Health Gaps<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#home-health-gaps">#</a></h3>
<p>Medicare-certified home health agencies theoretically provide an alternative to institutional care, but <strong>coverage gaps leave approximately 21% of rural counties without any certified home health provider</strong>. Even where agencies exist, capacity constraints mean referrals go unfilled and services remain unavailable.</p>
<p>The financial dynamics disfavor rural service areas. Home health workers in rural regions spend significant time traveling between patient homes, reducing direct care hours and increasing per-visit costs. Fuel costs and vehicle maintenance consume larger shares of already thin margins. Medicare payment policy provides modest rural add-ons that fail to offset geographic cost differentials.</p>
<p>Agency consolidation compounds access problems. Publicly traded companies and insurer-owned organizations that acquire independent agencies often subsequently reduce service areas, especially in low-density rural markets. <strong>The same caregiver can complete more visits per day in dense suburban territories than in scattered rural geographies.</strong> Rationalization follows financial logic that rural coverage cannot survive.</p>
<h3 id="the-geriatrician-vacuum">The Geriatrician Vacuum<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-geriatrician-vacuum">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>The United States has approximately 7,000 geriatricians for a 65+ population exceeding 58 million</strong>, yielding roughly 1.07 geriatricians for every 10,000 geriatric patients. The American Geriatrics Society estimates that one geriatrician can care for about 700 patients. The gap between need and capacity is enormous and growing.</p>
<p>Rural areas fare worse. A 2024 JAMA Network Open study found that <strong>63.9% of all U.S. counties, primarily small and nonmetropolitan counties, had no geriatricians or geriatric nurse practitioners throughout the 2010 to 2020 study period</strong>. The national per capita supply of geriatricians actually decreased by 12.7% during this period even as the elderly population expanded.</p>
<p>The compensation structure guarantees continued shortage. Geriatricians earn approximately $20,000 less annually than internists who completed no fellowship training. The complex, time-intensive nature of geriatric care produces lower revenue per visit than procedure-heavy specialties. <strong>Young physicians choosing specialties have strong financial incentives to avoid geriatrics.</strong> Only one in ten U.S. medical schools now requires a clinical experience in geriatrics, down from one in four in 2010.</p>
<h3 id="family-caregiver-exhaustion">Family Caregiver Exhaustion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#family-caregiver-exhaustion">#</a></h3>
<p>The traditional backstop for formal care has been family caregiving. But the demographic dynamics that aged rural communities also depleted the family caregiver pool. <strong>Adult children who might provide care have moved to metropolitan areas for employment.</strong> They manage crises from a distance through phone calls and periodic visits but cannot provide daily assistance.</p>
<p>Family caregivers who remain are themselves aging. A spouse providing care may be in their late seventies or eighties. Adult children still in rural communities are often in their fifties or sixties with their own health limitations. The caregiver support ratio, measuring potential family caregivers (age 45 to 64) per person 80 and older, stands at 4.2:1 in rural areas compared to 6.1:1 in urban areas. This ratio will decline further as the population ages.</p>
<p><strong>Caregiver burnout produces predictable consequences:</strong> premature institutionalization, emergency department utilization for manageable conditions, unaddressed decline in function. When caregivers collapse, care recipients often face abrupt transitions to whatever institutional options remain available, regardless of fit or preference.</p>
<h2 id="what-collapse-looks-like">What Collapse Looks Like<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-collapse-looks-like">#</a></h2>
<p>Mildred Hastings is 84 years old and has lived in Owsley County, Kentucky, her entire life. Her husband Howard farmed tobacco for forty years before emphysema claimed him in 2019. Their son moved to Louisville after high school; their daughter married and settled in Lexington. Both visit when they can, which is not often.</p>
<p>Mildred managed independently until a fall fractured her hip in October 2024. After surgery in Berea, the hospital discharge planner searched for rehabilitation options. <strong>The county&rsquo;s only nursing home closed in 2021.</strong> The nearest available facility was in Richmond, forty miles away through winding mountain roads. Her daughter took family leave to bring her home instead, arranging physical therapy visits twice weekly.</p>
<p>The home health agency serving Owsley County has two therapists covering five counties. Mildred&rsquo;s sessions were often cancelled due to weather, scheduling conflicts, or therapist illness. Her daughter returned to work after four weeks. Mildred&rsquo;s progress stalled.</p>
<p>Now Mildred uses a walker but cannot safely cook, bathe, or manage her medications independently. <strong>Her options are stark:</strong> move to the Richmond nursing home permanently, abandoning her home of sixty years and living an hour from anyone she knows; move in with her daughter in Lexington, leaving behind her community, her church, and every anchor of her identity; or stay home and hope nothing else goes wrong.</p>
<p>She chose to stay. Her church organizes meal deliveries twice weekly. A neighbor checks on her most days. Her children call nightly and visit monthly. She knows this arrangement is fragile. Another fall, a stroke, or her neighbor moving away could collapse the entire structure.</p>
<p><strong>What would transformation provide?</strong> RHTP funding flows to Kentucky. The state&rsquo;s application mentions aging services and caregiver support. But Owsley County has no agency positioned to receive grants, no workforce to hire even with funding, no infrastructure to expand. The transformation happening in Lexington and Louisville will not reach Owsley County before Mildred&rsquo;s options run out.</p>

<p><strong>Reviewing state RHTP applications reveals universal acknowledgment of aging challenges and nearly universal absence of evidence-based intervention specifications.</strong> States propose aging services, caregiver support, and care coordination without specifying which program models they will implement, how they will adapt models for rural contexts, or what outcomes they expect to achieve.</p>
<p>Common concerning patterns include:</p>
<p><strong>Workforce assumptions without workforce strategies.</strong> States propose expanding home health and direct care services without addressing the labor market dynamics causing current shortages. More funding does not automatically produce more workers willing to provide care at prevailing wages.</p>
<p><strong>Technology solutions for populations with technology barriers.</strong> Telehealth features prominently in applications, but plans to address digital literacy, broadband access, and technology support for elderly users are typically absent or superficial.</p>
<p><strong>Care coordination without care to coordinate.</strong> States propose connecting elderly residents with services when the problem is often service absence rather than service fragmentation. Coordination produces value when services exist to coordinate.</p>
<h2 id="alternative-perspective-the-aging-in-place-promise">Alternative Perspective: The Aging in Place Promise<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#alternative-perspective-the-aging-in-place-promise">#</a></h2>
<p>The federal policy preference for aging in place assumes that with proper support, most elderly can remain in their homes rather than entering institutional care. This assumption drives RHTP investments toward home health, caregiver support, and community-based services rather than institutional infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>The strongest version of this view:</strong> Institutional care is expensive, often unwanted, and produces worse quality of life than community-based alternatives. Elderly people prefer remaining in familiar environments near people and places they know. Investments in home-based care, assistive technology, and caregiver support produce better outcomes at lower cost than institutional care. The nursing home closures are not crisis but correction, eliminating expensive institutional options that most elderly would not choose anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment: Aging in place is policy preference but requires infrastructure that often does not exist in rural areas.</strong> Home health, adult day services, accessible housing, and caregiver support are urban assumptions. For rural elderly, aging in place may mean aging without services. The promise exceeds capacity.</p>
<p>The evidence is decidedly mixed. Programs like Vermont&rsquo;s SASH demonstrate that aging in place with services can reduce Medicare spending and improve outcomes. But SASH operates in Vermont, a small state with policy coherence, statewide infrastructure, and decades of investment. <strong>Replicating SASH in Mississippi or Montana faces obstacles that program design cannot overcome.</strong> The absence of service infrastructure, workforce, and institutional capacity means rural aging in place often defaults to aging without services rather than aging with community support.</p>
<p>The alternative perspective has merit in principle. Institutional care should not be the default. But rural implementation reality reveals that deinstitutionalization without community infrastructure investment produces abandonment, not liberation. Current RHTP applications largely fail to recognize this distinction.</p>

<p>Regional patterns reveal that rural elderly in the Upper Midwest and New England, despite harsh winters and sparse populations, often fare better than rural elderly in the Deep South and Appalachia. The difference is not climate or culture but infrastructure. States that invested in aging services networks, Medicaid home and community-based waivers, and Area Agencies on Aging over decades have capacity that states starting from crisis cannot replicate within RHTP timelines.</p>

<h2 id="assessment-and-recommendations">Assessment and Recommendations<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#assessment-and-recommendations">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>For RHTP Implementation:</strong></p>
<p>States should prioritize interventions with rapid implementation timelines and demonstrated effectiveness: care coordination, caregiver support, community paramedicine. Long-term infrastructure investments in PACE and workforce pipelines are valuable but will not produce meaningful capacity before 2030. <strong>Honest assessment suggests RHTP can improve conditions for some rural elders in some locations. It cannot prevent the broader structural decline in rural eldercare infrastructure.</strong></p>
<p><strong>For Federal Policy:</strong></p>
<p>The rural elderly crisis requires sustained investment beyond RHTP&rsquo;s 2030 sunset. Medicare payment reform for geriatric services, Medicaid HCBS expansion, and direct federal investment in geriatric workforce development address structural drivers that time-limited demonstration programs cannot reach.</p>
<p><strong>For Rural Communities:</strong></p>
<p>Community-based responses that do not depend on external infrastructure may prove more durable than program-dependent services. Faith communities organizing care networks, neighbors checking on neighbors, and mutual aid arrangements have sustained rural elderly for generations. <strong>Transformation should support these informal systems rather than replace them with formal services that cannot be sustained.</strong></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>Rural elderly face a temporal trap: they need services now, but building service capacity takes time they do not have. RHTP investments acknowledge this population&rsquo;s challenges without resolving the fundamental tension between current need and infrastructure development. States propose aging services using generic language that obscures implementation uncertainty.</p>
<p><strong>The evidence supports a sobering assessment.</strong> Universal RHTP approaches provide moderate benefit for rural elderly in communities with existing infrastructure to expand. They provide minimal benefit in communities starting from infrastructure absence. The populations in greatest need, those in nursing home deserts and geriatrician vacuums, are least likely to experience meaningful transformation within program timelines.</p>
<p>This is not policy failure in the sense of correctable design flaws. It is policy confronting structural constraints that program design cannot overcome. Rural elderly will continue aging in communities with collapsing care infrastructure regardless of RHTP investments. The honest question is not whether transformation will solve the rural elderly crisis but what modest improvements are achievable given resources, timelines, and structural constraints that transformation cannot change.</p>
