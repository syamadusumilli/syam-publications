  "articleBody": "Nearly 4.7 million veterans live in rural America. They served their country in Vietnam, the Gulf War, Iraq, Afghanistan, and peacetime deployments across the globe. They earned healthcare through that service. The Department of Veterans Affairs promises to deliver it. But VA facilities concentrate in cities, and the promise does not reach the places where rural veterans live.\nRHTP operates through state health systems. VA operates through a federal system independent of states. When a veteran in rural Montana needs care for service-connected PTSD and Agent Orange exposure, the VA system that understands his conditions is 150 miles away. The local rural hospital is 20 miles away but knows nothing about military trauma. RHTP can strengthen that rural hospital. RHTP cannot make it understand what this veteran experienced.\nThe tension rural veterans face is not about eligibility but about geography. They have earned healthcare. They cannot access it without choosing between systems that understand them and systems that are close enough to reach.\nPopulation Profile Definition and Scale\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs defines rural veterans using Rural-Urban Commuting Area (RUCA) codes. By this classification, approximately 4.7 million veterans (26% of all veterans) live in rural areas. Of the approximately 9.1 million veterans enrolled in VA healthcare, about 2.7 million (30%) live in rural communities.\nVeterans are not evenly distributed across rural America:\nState Rural Veterans % of State Veterans VA Facilities Texas 312,000 18% 5 VAMCs Florida 195,000 13% 8 VAMCs Pennsylvania 142,000 18% 6 VAMCs North Carolina 138,000 19% 4 VAMCs Ohio 125,000 16% 4 VAMCs Georgia 121,000 17% 3 VAMCs Tennessee 98,000 20% 4 VAMCs Virginia 94,000 15% 3 VAMCs States with large veteran populations have multiple VA Medical Centers, but those facilities concentrate in metropolitan areas. Rural counties may have Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs), but CBOCs provide limited services compared to full VAMCs.\nDemographic Characteristics\nRural veterans are older on average than both urban veterans and the general rural population. The median age of rural veterans exceeds 60. Vietnam-era veterans constitute a substantial portion, bringing Agent Orange exposure, PTSD from that conflict, and the aging-related conditions that compound service-connected disabilities.\nPost-9/11 veterans are younger but face different challenges. PACT Act expansion has made millions of Gulf War and post-9/11 veterans eligible for VA healthcare based on toxic exposure presumptions. Burn pit exposure, particulate matter, and chemical hazards during deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan produce respiratory conditions, cancers, and other illnesses that manifest years after service.\nService-connected disabilities are more common among veterans who seek VA care than among veterans generally. Rural veterans accessing VA have higher rates of PTSD, traumatic brain injury, musculoskeletal conditions from physical demands of service, and hearing loss from weapons fire and equipment noise.\nEconomic status varies. Many rural veterans are retired and rely on VA healthcare as their primary or sole coverage. Others work in agriculture, manufacturing, and trades where employer-sponsored insurance may be limited. Veterans often have multiple coverage sources: VA, Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance may all apply depending on service-connection status and income.\nHealth Status and Access Outcome Disparities\nMeasure Rural Veterans Urban Veterans Gap Source Suicide rate 32.4/100,000 22.1/100,000 +47% VA Mental health treatment 42% 51% -9pp VA Drive time to VAMC 75+ minutes 25 minutes +200% VA Specialty care wait 34 days 28 days +21% VA Diabetes control (A1C \u003c9) 71% 76% -5pp VA Preventive care completion 68% 74% -6pp VA Opioid prescriptions Higher Lower Variable VA Telehealth utilization 31% 24% +7pp VA Rural veterans show higher suicide rates than urban veterans, a disparity driven by access to lethal means (firearms), isolation, and reduced access to mental health services. The rural veteran suicide crisis represents one of the most urgent challenges in veteran health.\nAccess Barriers\nDistance to VA facilities is the defining barrier. Only 64% of rural veterans live within 40 miles of a VA healthcare facility. Many live 100+ miles from the nearest VAMC. CBOCs provide primary care but not the specialty services that complex conditions require.\nWorkforce shortages affect VA facilities serving rural areas. The 25% physician vacancy rate at IHS appears in VA rural facilities as well. Mental health providers are particularly scarce. A veteran needing specialized PTSD treatment may wait months for appointments or travel hours for each session.\nCommunity Care coordination problems persist despite the MISSION Act’s expansion of non-VA care options. Veterans eligible for community care must navigate authorization processes that create delays. Local providers may be unfamiliar with VA administrative requirements. Care coordination between VA and community providers often fails.\nBroadband limitations constrain telehealth expansion. VA has invested heavily in telehealth for mental health and primary care. Rural veterans in areas without reliable internet cannot access these services. The digital divide creates healthcare access disparities within the veteran population.\nVA Healthcare System Structure\nThe Veterans Health Administration operates the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States:\nVA Medical Centers (VAMCs) number 171 facilities providing comprehensive inpatient and outpatient services. VAMCs are located primarily in metropolitan areas where veteran populations concentrate.\nCommunity Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs) number over 1,000 facilities providing primary care, mental health, and limited specialty services in communities outside VAMC catchment areas. CBOCs bring VA care closer to rural veterans but cannot provide comprehensive services.\nVet Centers number 300+ facilities providing readjustment counseling, PTSD treatment, and Military Sexual Trauma services in community-based settings. Vet Centers specifically serve combat veterans and survivors of MST.\nCommunity Care enables VA to pay for care at non-VA facilities when veterans meet eligibility criteria. The MISSION Act of 2018 established the current Veterans Community Care Program with access standards based on drive time and appointment wait times.\nThe Office of Rural Health within VHA focuses specifically on rural veteran access. Established by Congress in 2006, ORH funds research, develops innovative programs, and operates five Veterans Rural Health Resource Centers that test approaches to rural care delivery.\nCommunity Care Expansion\nThe VA MISSION Act created access standards that determine community care eligibility:\nDrive time standards: Veterans qualify for community care if average drive time to the nearest VA facility exceeds 30 minutes for primary care or mental health, or if wait times exceed 20 days for primary care/mental health or 28 days for specialty care.\nBest medical interest: Veterans may receive community care when a VA provider determines it serves the veteran’s best medical interest, though this determination has been inconsistently applied.\nElizabeth Dole Act changes (2025): Recent legislation streamlined the best medical interest determination process, removing administrative hurdles that delayed community care authorizations.\nCommunity care spending has grown substantially. The FY2026 budget includes $34.7 billion for community care, representing approximately 50% increase from recent years. This growth reflects both policy expansion and VA facility capacity limitations.\nThe Coordination Problem\nCommunity care creates coordination challenges that RHTP cannot solve but rural health transformation must accommodate:\nInformation sharing between VA and community providers remains inconsistent. Veterans receive care from providers who cannot access their VA medical records. Prescriptions, lab results, and treatment plans may not transfer between systems.\nProvider familiarity with veteran-specific conditions varies dramatically. A rural hospital may be excellent at general medicine but unfamiliar with military trauma, toxic exposure conditions, or the psychological effects of combat. Veterans receive technically competent care from providers who do not understand their experience.\nCare continuity suffers when veterans move between VA and community systems. Chronic disease management requires consistent provider relationships. Veterans accessing both systems may have inconsistent treatment approaches.\nThe Core Tension: Separate Systems vs. Mainstream Integration Veterans have earned healthcare through service. VA provides specialized care that understands military experience. But VA facilities are far from rural veterans’ homes. Local providers are close but unfamiliar with what veterans have experienced.\nThe Separate Systems Value\nVA healthcare provides services that mainstream systems cannot replicate:\nMilitary cultural competence shapes every aspect of VA care. Providers understand rank structures, deployment experiences, military sexual trauma, and the unique stressors of military service. This understanding enables therapeutic relationships that civilian providers may struggle to establish.\nSpecialized expertise concentrates in VA for conditions prevalent among veterans: PTSD, traumatic brain injury, amputee care, spinal cord injury, toxic exposure conditions, and blast injuries. VA has developed treatment protocols and provider expertise that civilian healthcare systems lack.\nPresumptive eligibility under the PACT Act means veterans with toxic exposure during service can access VA care without proving service connection for specific conditions. Over 5.6 million veterans have received free toxic exposure screenings under PACT Act provisions.\nResearch integration connects VA clinical care with the nation’s largest clinical research program focused on veteran health. Veterans receiving VA care may access clinical trials and innovative treatments unavailable in civilian systems.\nThe Mainstream Integration Case\nSeparate systems fail when separation means inaccessibility:\nGeographic reality means most rural veterans cannot reach VA facilities for routine care. A veteran needing blood pressure monitoring should not drive three hours each direction for a 15-minute appointment.\nService limitations at rural CBOCs mean VA cannot provide comprehensive care close to home. Specialty care, surgery, and advanced diagnostics require traveling to VAMCs regardless of distance.\nCoordination with other care becomes essential for veterans with non-service-connected conditions. Veterans may have VA coverage for PTSD and private insurance for cardiac conditions. Integrated care requires systems that can communicate.\nWorkforce economics favor integration. Rural areas cannot support duplicate healthcare systems. A rural hospital and a CBOC competing for the same small patient population weakens both. Integration could strengthen rural health infrastructure while maintaining veteran-specific services.\nThe Evidence Assessment\nEvidence does not clearly favor either pure separation or complete integration. Outcomes improve when veterans access both VA specialty services and local primary care with effective coordination. Outcomes suffer when veterans fall between systems, traveling hours for VA care or receiving community care from providers who do not understand their experience.\nThe question is not which system is better but how systems coordinate. RHTP could support coordination by training rural providers in veteran-specific conditions, funding telehealth infrastructure that connects rural providers with VA specialists, and requiring RHTP-funded facilities to establish VA partnerships.\nCarl’s War Carl Johannsen is 72 years old and has lived in rural Oregon since returning from Vietnam in 1971. His service-connected conditions include PTSD from combat operations and diabetes presumed connected to Agent Orange exposure. Managing both requires regular care that rural Oregon makes difficult to access.\nThe nearest VA Medical Center is in Portland, 175 miles from Carl’s home. The drive takes three and a half hours in good weather, longer when mountain passes ice over in winter. Portland VA has providers who understand what he experienced in the Central Highlands. They have seen thousands of veterans like him. They do not ask why sudden noises startle him or why he cannot sleep without nightmares five decades later.\nThe CBOC in his county is 40 miles away. It offers primary care and telemental health but not the specialized PTSD treatment he needs. The diabetes educator visits monthly. Lab work is available but specialist consultations require traveling to Portland.\nCommunity Care authorization allows Carl to see local providers for some services. The rural hospital 25 miles from his home has competent physicians. But when he tried to explain why he needed to sit facing the door in the waiting room, they looked at him like he was strange. When the nurse asked about his military service for a routine form, he could not explain Vietnam to someone who had never heard of the places where his friends died.\nCarl manages his conditions using both systems. He makes the Portland trip quarterly for PTSD treatment and endocrinology. He uses the CBOC for routine primary care. He uses the local hospital for emergencies and lab work. His medical records do not connect. Each system knows part of his story.\n“I served my country,” Carl says. “The VA serves me well. They just serve me 175 miles away.”\nRHTP and Rural Veteran Access What RHTP Provides\nRHTP funding flows to states, not to VA. But RHTP-supported initiatives can improve care for veterans accessing non-VA rural healthcare:\nWorkforce development programs could include veteran-specific training. Rural providers who understand military culture, trauma-informed care, and service-connected conditions can better serve veterans accessing community care.\nTelehealth infrastructure investments benefit veterans and non-veterans alike. Broadband expansion, telehealth equipment, and platform adoption enable VA telehealth services to reach rural veterans at local facilities.\nCare coordination improvements in rural health systems could extend to VA relationships. HIE connections, care management programs, and transition protocols could include VA coordination.\nSeveral states have incorporated veteran-specific provisions in RHTP applications:\nState Veteran Provisions Implementation Approach Montana CBOC partnerships VA-rural hospital coordination Texas Veteran telehealth Broadband expansion focus Virginia Military trauma training Workforce development Oklahoma Veteran suicide prevention Behavioral health integration North Carolina Veteran outreach CHW veteran navigation States with large veteran populations and strong veterans’ advocacy have generally included veteran components. States where veteran populations are less visible politically may not prioritize veteran-specific transformation.\nWhat RHTP Cannot Provide\nVA system redesign is beyond RHTP scope. RHTP cannot move VAMCs closer to rural veterans, increase VA staffing, or change VA facility placement decisions.\nVA funding increases require congressional appropriations. The fundamental resource constraints affecting VA healthcare for rural veterans are federal budget decisions that RHTP does not influence.\nMilitary cultural competence in the civilian workforce requires sustained training investment that RHTP workforce programs may not emphasize. A few hours of cultural competency training does not produce providers who understand military experience.\nCoordination authority over VA activities does not rest with states. RHTP can fund state initiatives that complement VA services, but states cannot direct VA coordination efforts.\nWhat Transformation Requires\nEffective transformation for rural veterans requires action from both VA and state-administered RHTP:\nVA must extend reach through expanded telehealth, mobile clinics, and partnerships with rural health facilities. The Office of Rural Health has piloted innovative approaches; scaling successful models requires sustained investment.\nStates must include veterans in RHTP planning and implementation. Veteran Service Organizations, VA representatives, and veteran community members should participate in transformation design.\nTraining investments should include veteran-specific components. Rural providers receiving RHTP-supported training should learn about military trauma, service-connected conditions, and VA coordination.\nCoordination mechanisms should connect RHTP-funded initiatives with VA services. Electronic health record interoperability, shared care protocols, and joint quality improvement could improve outcomes for veterans accessing both systems.\nSuicide prevention requires coordinated state-VA efforts. The rural veteran suicide crisis demands community-based approaches that neither VA nor RHTP can implement alone.\nAlternative Perspective: The VA Coordination View The strongest version of this view: VA should coordinate with rather than replace local care for rural veterans. VA expertise in military-specific conditions combined with local primary care access could serve better than either alone. Veterans should not have to choose between systems that understand them and systems they can reach.\nThis view has practical appeal. Rural areas cannot support duplicate healthcare systems. VA telehealth connecting to local facilities could bring VA expertise to communities where VA facilities will never exist. Training local providers in veteran-specific care could extend VA-quality services through mainstream systems.\nThe counterargument: Coordination requires systems that communicate effectively. VA and civilian healthcare are different worlds with different medical records, different administrative requirements, different cultures. Veterans who have navigated VA bureaucracy understand its particular frustrations; adding civilian bureaucracy creates complexity, not coordination.\nAssessment: The coordination view has merit but faces implementation challenges. Successful coordination models exist: VA partnerships with community health centers, telehealth programs connecting rural facilities with VA specialists, and Community Care arrangements that work when properly managed. But scaling successful pilots requires sustained investment and administrative capacity that neither VA nor state systems consistently demonstrate.\nRHTP could support coordination by funding rural health infrastructure that connects with VA services. States that build VA partnerships into transformation planning will serve rural veterans better than states that treat VA as a separate system beyond their concern.\nIntersectionality Note Veterans belong to multiple populations simultaneously. An elderly veteran in a persistent poverty Appalachian community faces compounding challenges that single-population analysis misses.\nTribal veterans may be eligible for both IHS and VA care, navigating two federal systems that do not coordinate well with each other or with state-administered RHTP initiatives.\nVeterans with substance use disorder face treatment deserts common in rural areas, compounded by stigma that military culture may reinforce. Medication-assisted treatment availability is limited; culturally appropriate SUD treatment for veterans is rarer still.\nElderly veterans experience aging-related conditions while managing service-connected disabilities. Long-term care options for veterans in rural areas are severely limited. The VA Community Living Centers have long wait lists; community nursing homes may lack capacity to manage complex veteran health needs.\nWomen veterans face barriers specific to their experience. Reproductive healthcare, military sexual trauma treatment, and gender-specific services may be unavailable at rural VA facilities. Women veterans report feeling unwelcome in veteran spaces designed around male experience.\nSeries 9 population articles should not treat veteran status as exclusive. Cross-references to other population articles should note where veteran experience intersects with other disadvantaged populations.\nSources Department of Veterans Affairs. “FY2026 Budget Submission.” VA, 2025.\nGovernment Accountability Office. “VA Health Care: Office of Rural Health Efforts and Recommendations for Improvement.” GAO-24-107245.

<p>Nearly 4.7 million veterans live in rural America. They served their country in Vietnam, the Gulf War, Iraq, Afghanistan, and peacetime deployments across the globe. They earned healthcare through that service. The Department of Veterans Affairs promises to deliver it. But VA facilities concentrate in cities, and <strong>the promise does not reach the places where rural veterans live</strong>.</p>
<p>RHTP operates through state health systems. VA operates through a federal system independent of states. When a veteran in rural Montana needs care for service-connected PTSD and Agent Orange exposure, the VA system that understands his conditions is 150 miles away. The local rural hospital is 20 miles away but knows nothing about military trauma. RHTP can strengthen that rural hospital. RHTP cannot make it understand what this veteran experienced.</p>
<p><strong>The tension rural veterans face is not about eligibility but about geography.</strong> They have earned healthcare. They cannot access it without choosing between systems that understand them and systems that are close enough to reach.</p>
<h2 id="population-profile">Population Profile<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#population-profile">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Definition and Scale</strong></p>
<p>The Department of Veterans Affairs defines rural veterans using Rural-Urban Commuting Area (RUCA) codes. By this classification, approximately <strong>4.7 million veterans</strong> (26% of all veterans) live in rural areas. Of the approximately 9.1 million veterans enrolled in VA healthcare, <strong>about 2.7 million</strong> (30%) live in rural communities.</p>
<p>Veterans are not evenly distributed across rural America:</p>

<p>States with large veteran populations have multiple VA Medical Centers, but those facilities concentrate in metropolitan areas. Rural counties may have Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs), but CBOCs provide limited services compared to full VAMCs.</p>
<p><strong>Demographic Characteristics</strong></p>
<p>Rural veterans are <strong>older on average</strong> than both urban veterans and the general rural population. The median age of rural veterans exceeds 60. Vietnam-era veterans constitute a substantial portion, bringing Agent Orange exposure, PTSD from that conflict, and the aging-related conditions that compound service-connected disabilities.</p>
<p>Post-9/11 veterans are younger but face different challenges. <strong>PACT Act expansion</strong> has made millions of Gulf War and post-9/11 veterans eligible for VA healthcare based on toxic exposure presumptions. Burn pit exposure, particulate matter, and chemical hazards during deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan produce respiratory conditions, cancers, and other illnesses that manifest years after service.</p>
<p><strong>Service-connected disabilities</strong> are more common among veterans who seek VA care than among veterans generally. Rural veterans accessing VA have <strong>higher rates</strong> of PTSD, traumatic brain injury, musculoskeletal conditions from physical demands of service, and hearing loss from weapons fire and equipment noise.</p>
<p><strong>Economic status</strong> varies. Many rural veterans are retired and rely on VA healthcare as their primary or sole coverage. Others work in agriculture, manufacturing, and trades where employer-sponsored insurance may be limited. Veterans often have multiple coverage sources: VA, Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance may all apply depending on service-connection status and income.</p>

<p>Rural veterans show <strong>higher suicide rates</strong> than urban veterans, a disparity driven by access to lethal means (firearms), isolation, and reduced access to mental health services. The rural veteran suicide crisis represents one of the most urgent challenges in veteran health.</p>

<p><strong>Distance to VA facilities</strong> is the defining barrier. Only <strong>64% of rural veterans</strong> live within 40 miles of a VA healthcare facility. Many live 100+ miles from the nearest VAMC. CBOCs provide primary care but not the specialty services that complex conditions require.</p>
<p><strong>Workforce shortages</strong> affect VA facilities serving rural areas. The 25% physician vacancy rate at IHS appears in VA rural facilities as well. Mental health providers are particularly scarce. A veteran needing specialized PTSD treatment may wait months for appointments or travel hours for each session.</p>
<p><strong>Community Care coordination problems</strong> persist despite the MISSION Act&rsquo;s expansion of non-VA care options. Veterans eligible for community care must navigate authorization processes that create delays. Local providers may be unfamiliar with VA administrative requirements. Care coordination between VA and community providers often fails.</p>
<p><strong>Broadband limitations</strong> constrain telehealth expansion. VA has invested heavily in telehealth for mental health and primary care. Rural veterans in areas without reliable internet cannot access these services. The <strong>digital divide</strong> creates healthcare access disparities within the veteran population.</p>
<h2 id="va-healthcare-system">VA Healthcare System<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#va-healthcare-system">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Structure</strong></p>
<p>The Veterans Health Administration operates the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States:</p>
<p><strong>VA Medical Centers (VAMCs)</strong> number 171 facilities providing comprehensive inpatient and outpatient services. VAMCs are located primarily in metropolitan areas where veteran populations concentrate.</p>
<p><strong>Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs)</strong> number over 1,000 facilities providing primary care, mental health, and limited specialty services in communities outside VAMC catchment areas. CBOCs bring VA care closer to rural veterans but cannot provide comprehensive services.</p>
<p><strong>Vet Centers</strong> number 300+ facilities providing readjustment counseling, PTSD treatment, and Military Sexual Trauma services in community-based settings. Vet Centers specifically serve combat veterans and survivors of MST.</p>
<p><strong>Community Care</strong> enables VA to pay for care at non-VA facilities when veterans meet eligibility criteria. The MISSION Act of 2018 established the current Veterans Community Care Program with access standards based on drive time and appointment wait times.</p>
<p><strong>The Office of Rural Health</strong> within VHA focuses specifically on rural veteran access. Established by Congress in 2006, ORH funds research, develops innovative programs, and operates five Veterans Rural Health Resource Centers that test approaches to rural care delivery.</p>
<p><strong>Community Care Expansion</strong></p>
<p>The VA MISSION Act created access standards that determine community care eligibility:</p>
<p><strong>Drive time standards:</strong> Veterans qualify for community care if average drive time to the nearest VA facility exceeds <strong>30 minutes for primary care or mental health</strong>, or if wait times exceed <strong>20 days for primary care/mental health</strong> or <strong>28 days for specialty care</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Best medical interest:</strong> Veterans may receive community care when a VA provider determines it serves the veteran&rsquo;s best medical interest, though this determination has been inconsistently applied.</p>
<p><strong>Elizabeth Dole Act changes (2025):</strong> Recent legislation streamlined the best medical interest determination process, removing administrative hurdles that delayed community care authorizations.</p>
<p>Community care spending has grown substantially. The FY2026 budget includes <strong>$34.7 billion</strong> for community care, representing approximately 50% increase from recent years. This growth reflects both policy expansion and VA facility capacity limitations.</p>
<p><strong>The Coordination Problem</strong></p>
<p>Community care creates coordination challenges that RHTP cannot solve but rural health transformation must accommodate:</p>
<p><strong>Information sharing</strong> between VA and community providers remains inconsistent. Veterans receive care from providers who cannot access their VA medical records. Prescriptions, lab results, and treatment plans may not transfer between systems.</p>
<p><strong>Provider familiarity</strong> with veteran-specific conditions varies dramatically. A rural hospital may be excellent at general medicine but unfamiliar with military trauma, toxic exposure conditions, or the psychological effects of combat. Veterans receive technically competent care from providers who do not understand their experience.</p>
<p><strong>Care continuity</strong> suffers when veterans move between VA and community systems. Chronic disease management requires consistent provider relationships. Veterans accessing both systems may have inconsistent treatment approaches.</p>
<h2 id="the-core-tension-separate-systems-vs-mainstream-integration">The Core Tension: Separate Systems vs. Mainstream Integration<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-core-tension-separate-systems-vs-mainstream-integration">#</a></h2>
<p>Veterans have earned healthcare through service. VA provides specialized care that understands military experience. But VA facilities are far from rural veterans&rsquo; homes. Local providers are close but unfamiliar with what veterans have experienced.</p>
<p><strong>The Separate Systems Value</strong></p>
<p>VA healthcare provides services that mainstream systems cannot replicate:</p>
<p><strong>Military cultural competence</strong> shapes every aspect of VA care. Providers understand rank structures, deployment experiences, military sexual trauma, and the unique stressors of military service. This understanding enables therapeutic relationships that civilian providers may struggle to establish.</p>
<p><strong>Specialized expertise</strong> concentrates in VA for conditions prevalent among veterans: PTSD, traumatic brain injury, amputee care, spinal cord injury, toxic exposure conditions, and blast injuries. VA has developed treatment protocols and provider expertise that civilian healthcare systems lack.</p>
<p><strong>Presumptive eligibility</strong> under the PACT Act means veterans with toxic exposure during service can access VA care without proving service connection for specific conditions. Over 5.6 million veterans have received free toxic exposure screenings under PACT Act provisions.</p>
<p><strong>Research integration</strong> connects VA clinical care with the nation&rsquo;s largest clinical research program focused on veteran health. Veterans receiving VA care may access clinical trials and innovative treatments unavailable in civilian systems.</p>
<p><strong>The Mainstream Integration Case</strong></p>
<p>Separate systems fail when separation means inaccessibility:</p>
<p><strong>Geographic reality</strong> means most rural veterans cannot reach VA facilities for routine care. A veteran needing blood pressure monitoring should not drive three hours each direction for a 15-minute appointment.</p>
<p><strong>Service limitations</strong> at rural CBOCs mean VA cannot provide comprehensive care close to home. Specialty care, surgery, and advanced diagnostics require traveling to VAMCs regardless of distance.</p>
<p><strong>Coordination with other care</strong> becomes essential for veterans with non-service-connected conditions. Veterans may have VA coverage for PTSD and private insurance for cardiac conditions. Integrated care requires systems that can communicate.</p>
<p><strong>Workforce economics</strong> favor integration. Rural areas cannot support duplicate healthcare systems. A rural hospital and a CBOC competing for the same small patient population weakens both. Integration could strengthen rural health infrastructure while maintaining veteran-specific services.</p>
<p><strong>The Evidence Assessment</strong></p>
<p>Evidence does not clearly favor either pure separation or complete integration. <strong>Outcomes improve</strong> when veterans access both VA specialty services and local primary care with effective coordination. <strong>Outcomes suffer</strong> when veterans fall between systems, traveling hours for VA care or receiving community care from providers who do not understand their experience.</p>
<p>The question is not which system is better but <strong>how systems coordinate</strong>. RHTP could support coordination by training rural providers in veteran-specific conditions, funding telehealth infrastructure that connects rural providers with VA specialists, and requiring RHTP-funded facilities to establish VA partnerships.</p>
<h2 id="carls-war">Carl&rsquo;s War<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#carls-war">#</a></h2>
<p><em>Carl Johannsen is 72 years old and has lived in rural Oregon since returning from Vietnam in 1971. His service-connected conditions include PTSD from combat operations and diabetes presumed connected to Agent Orange exposure. Managing both requires regular care that rural Oregon makes difficult to access.</em></p>
<p><em>The nearest VA Medical Center is in Portland, 175 miles from Carl&rsquo;s home. The drive takes three and a half hours in good weather, longer when mountain passes ice over in winter. Portland VA has providers who understand what he experienced in the Central Highlands. They have seen thousands of veterans like him. They do not ask why sudden noises startle him or why he cannot sleep without nightmares five decades later.</em></p>
<p><em>The CBOC in his county is 40 miles away. It offers primary care and telemental health but not the specialized PTSD treatment he needs. The diabetes educator visits monthly. Lab work is available but specialist consultations require traveling to Portland.</em></p>
<p><em>Community Care authorization allows Carl to see local providers for some services. The rural hospital 25 miles from his home has competent physicians. But when he tried to explain why he needed to sit facing the door in the waiting room, they looked at him like he was strange. When the nurse asked about his military service for a routine form, he could not explain Vietnam to someone who had never heard of the places where his friends died.</em></p>
<p><em>Carl manages his conditions using both systems. He makes the Portland trip quarterly for PTSD treatment and endocrinology. He uses the CBOC for routine primary care. He uses the local hospital for emergencies and lab work. His medical records do not connect. Each system knows part of his story.</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I served my country,&rdquo; Carl says. &ldquo;The VA serves me well. They just serve me 175 miles away.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><strong>What RHTP Provides</strong></p>
<p>RHTP funding flows to states, not to VA. But RHTP-supported initiatives can improve care for veterans accessing non-VA rural healthcare:</p>
<p><strong>Workforce development</strong> programs could include veteran-specific training. Rural providers who understand military culture, trauma-informed care, and service-connected conditions can better serve veterans accessing community care.</p>
<p><strong>Telehealth infrastructure</strong> investments benefit veterans and non-veterans alike. Broadband expansion, telehealth equipment, and platform adoption enable VA telehealth services to reach rural veterans at local facilities.</p>
<p><strong>Care coordination</strong> improvements in rural health systems could extend to VA relationships. HIE connections, care management programs, and transition protocols could include VA coordination.</p>
<p>Several states have incorporated veteran-specific provisions in RHTP applications:</p>

<p>States with large veteran populations and strong veterans&rsquo; advocacy have generally included veteran components. States where veteran populations are less visible politically may not prioritize veteran-specific transformation.</p>
<p><strong>What RHTP Cannot Provide</strong></p>
<p><strong>VA system redesign</strong> is beyond RHTP scope. RHTP cannot move VAMCs closer to rural veterans, increase VA staffing, or change VA facility placement decisions.</p>
<p><strong>VA funding increases</strong> require congressional appropriations. The fundamental resource constraints affecting VA healthcare for rural veterans are federal budget decisions that RHTP does not influence.</p>
<p><strong>Military cultural competence</strong> in the civilian workforce requires sustained training investment that RHTP workforce programs may not emphasize. A few hours of cultural competency training does not produce providers who understand military experience.</p>
<p><strong>Coordination authority</strong> over VA activities does not rest with states. RHTP can fund state initiatives that complement VA services, but states cannot direct VA coordination efforts.</p>
<p><strong>What Transformation Requires</strong></p>
<p>Effective transformation for rural veterans requires action from both VA and state-administered RHTP:</p>
<p><strong>VA must extend reach</strong> through expanded telehealth, mobile clinics, and partnerships with rural health facilities. The Office of Rural Health has piloted innovative approaches; scaling successful models requires sustained investment.</p>
<p><strong>States must include veterans</strong> in RHTP planning and implementation. Veteran Service Organizations, VA representatives, and veteran community members should participate in transformation design.</p>
<p><strong>Training investments</strong> should include veteran-specific components. Rural providers receiving RHTP-supported training should learn about military trauma, service-connected conditions, and VA coordination.</p>
<p><strong>Coordination mechanisms</strong> should connect RHTP-funded initiatives with VA services. Electronic health record interoperability, shared care protocols, and joint quality improvement could improve outcomes for veterans accessing both systems.</p>
<p><strong>Suicide prevention</strong> requires coordinated state-VA efforts. The rural veteran suicide crisis demands community-based approaches that neither VA nor RHTP can implement alone.</p>
<h2 id="alternative-perspective-the-va-coordination-view">Alternative Perspective: The VA Coordination View<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#alternative-perspective-the-va-coordination-view">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>The strongest version of this view:</strong> VA should coordinate with rather than replace local care for rural veterans. VA expertise in military-specific conditions combined with local primary care access could serve better than either alone. Veterans should not have to choose between systems that understand them and systems they can reach.</p>
<p>This view has practical appeal. Rural areas cannot support duplicate healthcare systems. VA telehealth connecting to local facilities could bring VA expertise to communities where VA facilities will never exist. Training local providers in veteran-specific care could extend VA-quality services through mainstream systems.</p>
<p><strong>The counterargument:</strong> Coordination requires systems that communicate effectively. VA and civilian healthcare are different worlds with different medical records, different administrative requirements, different cultures. Veterans who have navigated VA bureaucracy understand its particular frustrations; adding civilian bureaucracy creates complexity, not coordination.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment:</strong> The coordination view has merit but faces implementation challenges. Successful coordination models exist: VA partnerships with community health centers, telehealth programs connecting rural facilities with VA specialists, and Community Care arrangements that work when properly managed. But scaling successful pilots requires sustained investment and administrative capacity that neither VA nor state systems consistently demonstrate.</p>
<p>RHTP could support coordination by funding rural health infrastructure that connects with VA services. States that build VA partnerships into transformation planning will serve rural veterans better than states that treat VA as a separate system beyond their concern.</p>
<h2 id="intersectionality-note">Intersectionality Note<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#intersectionality-note">#</a></h2>
<p>Veterans belong to multiple populations simultaneously. An elderly veteran in a persistent poverty Appalachian community faces compounding challenges that single-population analysis misses.</p>
<p><strong>Tribal veterans</strong> may be eligible for both IHS and VA care, navigating two federal systems that do not coordinate well with each other or with state-administered RHTP initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>Veterans with substance use disorder</strong> face treatment deserts common in rural areas, compounded by stigma that military culture may reinforce. Medication-assisted treatment availability is limited; culturally appropriate SUD treatment for veterans is rarer still.</p>
<p><strong>Elderly veterans</strong> experience aging-related conditions while managing service-connected disabilities. Long-term care options for veterans in rural areas are severely limited. The VA Community Living Centers have long wait lists; community nursing homes may lack capacity to manage complex veteran health needs.</p>
<p><strong>Women veterans</strong> face barriers specific to their experience. Reproductive healthcare, military sexual trauma treatment, and gender-specific services may be unavailable at rural VA facilities. Women veterans report feeling unwelcome in veteran spaces designed around male experience.</p>
<p>Series 9 population articles should not treat veteran status as exclusive. Cross-references to other population articles should note where veteran experience intersects with other disadvantaged populations.</p>
