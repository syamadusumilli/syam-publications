  "articleBody": "Who counts as a member of a special population determines who receives targeted services, how resources allocate, and whether transformation reaches those most in need. This question seems technical but is fundamentally political. Every definition includes some people and excludes others. The elderly veteran living off-reservation who self-identifies as American Indian but lacks tribal enrollment faces different system access than the enrolled member living on tribal land. Both are “rural tribal veterans.” Programs may serve one or neither.\nThis technical document provides the methodological framework for identifying and quantifying the sixteen special populations examined across Series 9. The framework serves RHTP planners who must translate universal program language into population-specific implementation. It surfaces the definitional conflicts that arise when federal categories meet lived experience, and it acknowledges the fundamental limitation: administrative categories cannot capture human complexity.\nThe document emerges from methodological challenges encountered across Series 9 articles rather than abstract framework development. Each population article revealed specific identification problems. Rural farmworkers who move across state lines monthly cannot be counted through any static administrative system. Justice-involved individuals reenter communities without documentation of their status. Frontier populations exist only through geographic definitions that vary by agency. The framework below consolidates these challenges into usable guidance.\nWhy Definitions Matter for Transformation RHTP applications universally promise to serve “rural populations” and “underserved communities.” These phrases carry no operational meaning until translated into specific identification criteria. A state that commits to serving tribal populations must decide whether that means IHS-eligible individuals, Census-identified American Indians and Alaska Natives, or anyone residing on tribal land regardless of tribal membership. Each definition produces different counts, different service delivery requirements, and different coordination partners.\nDefinitional choices shape resource allocation in ways that policy language obscures. Consider two states with identical RHTP awards:\nState A defines rural elderly as Census-identified residents 65 and older in nonmetropolitan counties. This produces a clean count from American Community Survey data, enables straightforward needs assessment, and creates clear accountability metrics.\nState B defines rural elderly as Medicare beneficiaries 65 and older residing in areas meeting HRSA shortage area criteria. This produces a smaller count, focuses on areas with documented access barriers, but excludes elderly populations in technically non-shortage areas who nonetheless face significant access challenges.\nNeither definition is wrong. Both are incomplete. The choice between them is a policy decision disguised as a technical one. States making these choices rarely acknowledge the implications, and RHTP guidance provides no framework for consistent decision-making across states.\nThe identification challenges vary systematically by population type:\nDemographic populations (elderly, children) present fewest challenges because Census data provides reliable counts by age and geography. Definitions are standardized and data is current.\nGeographic populations (frontier, Appalachian, Black Belt) depend entirely on which classification system applies. A county may be frontier under USDA definitions but not under Census rural classifications. Different definitions produce different counts.\nCondition-based populations (SUD, SMI, complex medical conditions) rely on surveys, treatment data, or claims analysis that systematically undercount. Those not in treatment are invisible. Those without insurance generate no claims.\nCircumstance-based populations (farmworkers, justice-involved, veterans) exist through administrative systems that capture only portions of actual populations. Farmworkers who avoid documentation are uncounted. Veterans who never register with VA are invisible to VA data.\nLegally-defined populations (tribal members) require navigating multiple overlapping definitions with different federal authorities and different service implications.\nIdentification Approaches by Population The table below establishes primary identification methods for each Series 9 population, documents data sources, and identifies known limitations. These methods represent current best practice rather than perfect solutions.\nPopulation Primary Identification Method Secondary Methods Data Sources Key Limitations Rural Elderly (65+) Census age by rural geography Medicare enrollment, SSA data ACS, Census, CMS Accurate; definition of “rural” varies Tribal/Indigenous Tribal enrollment, Census AIAN category IHS user population, Urban Indian Organization registration BIA, Census, IHS Significant undercount of non-enrolled; enrollment criteria vary by tribe Frontier USDA Frontier and Remote Area codes (FAR 3-4) Census population density, RUCA codes USDA ERS, Census Accurate for defined criteria; multiple frontier definitions exist Farmworkers Agricultural census employer reports, NCFH estimates DOL H-2A visa data, Migrant Health Center utilization USDA, DOL, NCFH, HRSA Severe undercount of undocumented workers; seasonal variation Persistent Poverty Census poverty rate by county over multiple decades ARC distressed designation, USDA persistent poverty counties Census, ARC, USDA County-level masks within-county variation; 30-year lag in designation criteria Post-Industrial Economic transition indicators (manufacturing decline, mining closures) BLS industry data, ARC designations BLS, Census, ARC No standard definition; identification varies by study Black Belt/Delta Census race composition, historical geography ARC Delta Regional Authority designation Census, ARC Geographic boundaries contested; demographic composition changing Appalachian Appalachian Regional Commission county designation None; ARC designation is authoritative ARC Clear definition; includes economically diverse counties Border Geographic proximity to international boundaries DHS/CBP data, state designations Census, DHS Distance criteria vary (10-100 miles from border) Veterans VA registration, Census veteran identification DOD separation data, state veterans affairs VA, Census, DOD Accurate for VA-registered; significant non-registered population Children Census age by rural geography School enrollment, Medicaid child enrollment ACS, Census, Education, CMS Accurate; pediatric access measures less developed Justice-Involved BJS incarceration and community supervision data State DOC data, county jail records BJS, state DOC Captures currently supervised; poor tracking post-supervision SUD SAMHSA survey estimates, treatment admissions Medicaid claims, ED visit data NSDUH, TEDS, CMS Prevalence estimated; treatment data misses untreated SMI SAMHSA survey estimates, state mental health authority data Medicaid disability enrollment, SSI/SSDI NSDUH, state MHA, SSA Prevalence estimated; severe undercount in rural areas Complex Conditions Medicare/Medicaid claims, disease registries Hospital discharge data, specialty referral patterns CMS, HCUP, disease registries Misses uninsured; condition-specific data quality varies Autism/IDD CDC ADDM surveillance, Medicaid DD waiver enrollment Special education (IDEA) data, SSI childhood disability CDC, CMS, Education, SSA Rural underdiagnosis distorts prevalence; waiver waitlists obscure actual counts Critical Methodological Notes Census Undercounts\nThe decennial Census and American Community Survey systematically undercount specific populations. The Census Bureau estimates net undercounts of:\nAmerican Indian and Alaska Native populations on reservations: approximately 5.6% Hispanic populations: approximately 4.9% Children under age 5: approximately 2.8% Rural populations overall: approximately 1.5% These undercounts compound when populations overlap. An American Indian child on a rural reservation faces multiplicative undercount risk. State planners using Census data as denominators should adjust for known undercounts when available.\nAdministrative Data Limitations\nAdministrative data captures only populations touching specific systems. This creates systematic biases:\nTreatment data identifies those receiving services, not those needing them. SUD prevalence estimates based on treatment admissions miss the majority of individuals with substance use disorders who never enter treatment. Rural treatment gaps mean rural prevalence estimates from treatment data are particularly unreliable.\nClaims data identifies insured populations. The uninsured generate no claims. In states without Medicaid expansion, low-income adults may have conditions never documented in claims data. Complex condition identification from claims systematically excludes rural uninsured populations.\nEnrollment data identifies those who register. Veterans must actively register with VA to appear in VA data. Rural veterans, particularly younger veterans and those without service-connected disabilities, register at lower rates than urban veterans.\nSurvey Data Challenges\nSAMHSA’s National Survey on Drug Use and Health provides the primary prevalence estimates for SUD and SMI. Survey methodology creates rural-specific limitations:\nSample sizes in rural areas are small, producing large confidence intervals around rural prevalence estimates. State-level rural estimates may be based on fewer than 100 respondents.\nResponse rates differ between rural and urban populations. Whether rural populations are more or less likely to report stigmatized conditions remains debated.\nSurvey timing creates point-in-time estimates that may not capture seasonal variation in migrant populations or condition patterns.\nPopulation Size Estimates The estimates below represent the best available quantification of each Series 9 population. Confidence levels reflect both data quality and definitional stability. High confidence indicates reliable data with standardized definitions. Low confidence indicates significant measurement challenges, definitional variation, or both.\nPopulation Estimated Size (Rural) Confidence Level Primary Basis Key Qualifications Rural Elderly (65+) 9.3 million High Census ACS Stable definition; accurate counts Rural Tribal 1.1 million Moderate Census, IHS Undercount likely; enrollment criteria vary Frontier (FAR 3-4) 5.2 million High USDA ERS Accurate for FAR definition; other definitions yield different counts Farmworkers (rural) 1.8-2.5 million Low NCFH estimates Undocumented workers severely undercounted; seasonal variation Persistent Poverty 8.5 million Moderate Census, ARC County-level definition; within-county variation masked Post-Industrial 10-15 million Low Definition-dependent No standardized definition; range reflects definitional choices Black Belt/Delta 4.2 million Moderate Census Geographic boundaries shift with demographic change Appalachian 26.3 million total; approximately 11 million rural High ARC Defined boundaries; includes economically diverse areas Border 7.1 million total; approximately 2.8 million rural High Census Distance definition varies (10-100 miles) Rural Veterans 4.7 million High VA, Census Accurate for self-identified; VA registration subset Rural Children 9.1 million High Census ACS Accurate counts Justice-Involved 1.5 million (rural residence) Moderate BJS Captures currently supervised; post-supervision invisible Rural SUD 3.0-3.5 million Moderate NSDUH estimates Prevalence estimated; treatment penetration low Rural SMI 1.8-2.3 million Moderate NSDUH estimates Prevalence estimated; rural underdiagnosis likely Complex Conditions Variable by condition Variable Condition-specific Definition varies by condition; uninsured undercounted Rural Autism/IDD 1.2-1.8 million Low CDC ADDM, waiver data Rural underdiagnosis distorts; waiver waitlists obscure Population Size Uncertainty The ranges above mask substantial uncertainty that RHTP planners must acknowledge. Consider three populations with particularly problematic estimates:\nFarmworkers: The National Center for Farmworker Health estimates 2.4 million farmworkers nationally, with approximately 70% residing in rural areas during peak agricultural seasons. However, undocumented workers avoid enumeration, seasonal workers may be counted in multiple locations or none, and the distinction between farmworkers and agricultural laborers varies by data source. True rural farmworker population may be 20-40% higher than estimates suggest.\nJustice-Involved: Bureau of Justice Statistics reports 5.5 million adults under correctional supervision nationally. Rural residence estimates derive from offense location, release location, and survey data with significant missing information. Post-supervision populations are essentially invisible to administrative data. A person who completed probation five years ago and now lives in a rural community with health needs related to incarceration history appears in no justice-involved population count.\nAutism/IDD: CDC’s Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network estimates 1 in 36 children has autism spectrum disorder. However, ADDM sites are primarily metropolitan, and rural areas have documented diagnostic delays and underdiagnosis. Applying national prevalence to rural populations likely overstates identified cases while understating true prevalence. The rural autism population may be simultaneously undercounted (true prevalence) and overcounted (diagnosed prevalence) depending on which measure matters for service planning.\nIntersectionality Matrix Real people belong to multiple population categories simultaneously. Single-population analysis misses the compound disadvantage that shapes individual experience. The intersectionality matrix below identifies high-impact population overlaps that RHTP implementation must address.\nIntersection Population 1 Population 2 Compound Effect Estimated Size System Coordination Challenge Elderly + Frontier Rural Elderly Frontier Aging with no accessible services 1.1-1.3 million No infrastructure to coordinate Tribal + SUD Tribal SUD Historical trauma intersects addiction 180,000-220,000 IHS-state treatment system coordination Veteran + SMI Veterans SMI Military trauma, combat-related conditions 320,000-380,000 VA-state mental health coordination Black Belt + Elderly Black Belt/Delta Rural Elderly Historical discrimination compounds aging 750,000-850,000 Medicaid-Medicare dual eligible coordination Farmworker + Complex Conditions Farmworkers Complex Conditions Mobility disrupts specialty care 120,000-180,000 Cross-state continuity impossible Appalachian + SUD Appalachian SUD Economic despair, opioid crisis 550,000-650,000 Multi-state, multi-system coordination Justice + SUD Justice-Involved SUD Reentry + addiction recovery 700,000-800,000 Correctional-community treatment transitions Tribal + Elderly Tribal Rural Elderly Cultural context, IHS limitations 140,000-180,000 IHS-Medicare coordination Frontier + Children Frontier Children Development without pediatric access 680,000-750,000 Telehealth-dependent services Border + Farmworker Border Farmworkers Documentation barriers, seasonal migration 450,000-550,000 Cross-border continuity, documentation sensitivity Autism + Frontier Autism/IDD Frontier Diagnosis and services impossible 85,000-120,000 Telehealth inadequate for hands-on therapy Persistent Poverty + SMI Persistent Poverty SMI Economic distress, treatment access 280,000-350,000 Medicaid coverage gaps, workforce absence Analytical Implications Compound disadvantage is not additive. An elderly veteran in frontier Montana does not face elderly challenges plus veteran challenges plus frontier challenges in simple combination. The intersection creates qualitatively different circumstances. The veteran’s VA benefits exist in name only when the nearest VA facility is 200 miles away. The elderly person’s Medicare coverage provides little when no providers accept Medicare within driving distance. Each additional population membership does not add to disadvantage proportionally; it multiplies barriers.\nSystem coordination failures concentrate at intersections. A tribal member with SMI living in a persistent poverty county navigates IHS (tribal health), state mental health authority (SMI services), and potentially Medicaid (if expansion state) or no coverage (if non-expansion state). Each system has different eligibility criteria, different providers, different electronic records, and different geographic boundaries. The person most in need of coordinated care is least likely to receive it because multiple systems claim partial responsibility while none assumes full accountability.\nProgram design rarely acknowledges intersectionality. RHTP applications describe services for elderly populations and services for SUD populations as separate workstreams. The elderly person with alcohol use disorder receives neither geriatric-informed addiction treatment nor addiction-informed geriatric care. Categorical program design produces categorical service delivery that fragments care for people whose needs do not fit single categories.\nState-Level Estimation Guidance RHTP implementation requires states to translate national population estimates into state-specific service planning. The guidance below provides methodology for state-level population estimation.\nStep 1: Establish Geographic Baseline Define “rural” consistently for all population estimates. Options include:\nCensus Rural-Urban Continuum Codes (RUCC): Nine-category classification from metropolitan to completely rural. Most states use RUCC codes 4-9 or 7-9 depending on program requirements.\nHRSA Rural Health Information Hub definition: Nonmetropolitan counties plus metropolitan census tracts meeting specific population density criteria.\nState-specific definition: Some states have statutory rural definitions that may not align with federal classifications.\nWhatever definition selected, apply it consistently across all population estimates. Mixing definitions produces population estimates that cannot be summed or compared.\nStep 2: Apply Population-Specific Methodology For demographic populations (elderly, children, veterans):\nPull Census ACS data for selected geography Apply age, sex, or veteran status filters Adjust for known undercounts where available Confidence: High For geographic populations (frontier, Appalachian, Black Belt):\nApply authoritative designation (USDA FAR codes, ARC counties) Pull total population for designated areas Note overlap with state’s rural definition Confidence: High for designated populations; geographic overlap may create confusion For tribal populations:\nContact state tribal liaison and individual tribal governments Obtain IHS user population data for state Pull Census AIAN data for rural geography Reconcile differences (IHS eligible vs. self-identified vs. residing in state) Confidence: Moderate; multiple definitions yield different counts For condition-based populations (SUD, SMI, complex conditions):\nApply national prevalence to state rural population Adjust for state-specific factors (e.g., opioid prescribing rates, treatment availability) Cross-reference with treatment data as floor estimate Confidence: Low to moderate; prevalence estimates imprecise, treatment data undercounts For circumstance-based populations (farmworkers, justice-involved):\nObtain state-specific administrative data where available Apply multipliers for undocumented/uncounted populations Acknowledge uncertainty in planning documents Confidence: Low; administrative data captures fraction of true population Step 3: Assess Intersectionality Identify populations with significant state overlap Estimate intersection sizes using national ratios where state data unavailable Design service delivery that addresses compound disadvantage Build coordination mechanisms between systems serving overlapping populations Step 4: Document Methodology and Limitations Every state population estimate should include:\nDefinition used for each population category Data sources and vintage Known limitations and biases Confidence level assessment Comparison to alternative estimates where available Documentation enables accountability. When state plans claim to serve a population of a certain size, documentation enables evaluation of whether services actually reached that population. Without transparent methodology, evaluation is impossible.\nFederal Data Source Reference Primary Federal Sources Source Agency Content Update Frequency Access Rural Utility American Community Survey Census Demographics, disability, health insurance Annual Public High Decennial Census Census Total population, demographics Every 10 years Public High Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System CDC Health behaviors, chronic conditions Annual Public Moderate (state-level only) National Survey on Drug Use and Health SAMHSA SUD and mental health prevalence Annual Public (limited) Moderate (small rural sample) Treatment Episode Data Set SAMHSA SUD treatment admissions Annual Public Limited (treatment population only) Medicare Provider Data CMS Provider locations, enrollment, claims Continuous Public (aggregated) High Medicaid State Drug Utilization CMS Prescribing patterns Quarterly Public Moderate IHS User Population Data IHS AI/AN population receiving IHS services Annual Request required High for tribal populations Bureau of Justice Statistics DOJ Incarceration, supervision, recidivism Variable Public Moderate Agricultural Census USDA Farm operations, hired workers Every 5 years Public Moderate for farmworkers Rural-Urban Continuum Codes USDA ERS County rurality classification Every 10 years Public Essential Frontier and Remote Area Codes USDA ERS Frontier classification Every 10 years Public Essential for frontier Area Health Resources Files HRSA Health workforce, facilities Annual Public High State Data Integration Federal data provides baseline but state sources often offer greater specificity:\nState health departments maintain vital statistics, disease registries, and sometimes state-specific health surveys with better rural coverage than national surveys.\nState Medicaid agencies have detailed enrollment and claims data that CMS aggregates mask. State-level requests can produce rural-specific utilization patterns.\nState departments of corrections maintain incarceration and supervision data with residence information that BJS aggregates cannot provide.\nState labor departments may have farmworker program data beyond federal sources.\nState mental health authorities have data on public mental health system utilization not captured in national surveys.\nTribal governments maintain enrollment data more accurate than Census estimates for specific tribal nations.\nMethodological Recommendations For State RHTP Planners Use consistent definitions. Select rural classification and population definitions that apply throughout your application and implementation. Document selections explicitly.\nAcknowledge uncertainty. Precision implies false accuracy. Report ranges where appropriate, identify confidence levels, and explain limitations.\nPlan for intersectionality. Design services that address compound disadvantage, not just categorical populations.\nBuild local partnerships. Community organizations, tribal governments, and advocacy groups often have population knowledge that administrative data cannot capture.\nUpdate estimates regularly. Population distributions change. Annual reassessment using updated sources improves targeting.\nFor Federal RHTP Oversight Provide definitional guidance. States make different definitional choices producing non-comparable results. Standardized guidance would enable cross-state comparison.\nFund improved rural data collection. National surveys have inadequate rural sample sizes. Dedicated rural health surveys would improve prevalence estimates.\nRequire intersection analysis. Applications that address populations separately perpetuate categorical thinking that fails people with compound disadvantage.\nSupport tribal data sovereignty. Tribal nations should control how their population data is collected, analyzed, and shared.\nFor Researchers Report rural subgroup analyses. When study populations include rural participants, report rural-specific findings even with smaller sample sizes.\nDevelop rural prevalence adjustments. Research establishing how national prevalence estimates should be adjusted for rural populations would substantially improve state planning.\nStudy intersectionality empirically. The compound disadvantage framework is theoretically sound but empirical estimation of intersection effects remains limited.\nCross-References Series 9 Population Articles: Each article applies these identification methods to specific populations.

<p>Who counts as a member of a special population determines who receives targeted services, how resources allocate, and whether transformation reaches those most in need. This question seems technical but is fundamentally political. <strong>Every definition includes some people and excludes others.</strong> The elderly veteran living off-reservation who self-identifies as American Indian but lacks tribal enrollment faces different system access than the enrolled member living on tribal land. Both are &ldquo;rural tribal veterans.&rdquo; Programs may serve one or neither.</p>
<p>This technical document provides the methodological framework for identifying and quantifying the sixteen special populations examined across Series 9. The framework serves RHTP planners who must translate universal program language into population-specific implementation. It surfaces the definitional conflicts that arise when federal categories meet lived experience, and it acknowledges the fundamental limitation: <strong>administrative categories cannot capture human complexity</strong>.</p>
<p>The document emerges from methodological challenges encountered across Series 9 articles rather than abstract framework development. Each population article revealed specific identification problems. Rural farmworkers who move across state lines monthly cannot be counted through any static administrative system. Justice-involved individuals reenter communities without documentation of their status. Frontier populations exist only through geographic definitions that vary by agency. The framework below consolidates these challenges into usable guidance.</p>
<h2 id="why-definitions-matter-for-transformation">Why Definitions Matter for Transformation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#why-definitions-matter-for-transformation">#</a></h2>
<p>RHTP applications universally promise to serve &ldquo;rural populations&rdquo; and &ldquo;underserved communities.&rdquo; These phrases carry no operational meaning until translated into specific identification criteria. <strong>A state that commits to serving tribal populations must decide whether that means IHS-eligible individuals, Census-identified American Indians and Alaska Natives, or anyone residing on tribal land regardless of tribal membership.</strong> Each definition produces different counts, different service delivery requirements, and different coordination partners.</p>
<p>Definitional choices shape resource allocation in ways that policy language obscures. Consider two states with identical RHTP awards:</p>
<p><strong>State A</strong> defines rural elderly as Census-identified residents 65 and older in nonmetropolitan counties. This produces a clean count from American Community Survey data, enables straightforward needs assessment, and creates clear accountability metrics.</p>
<p><strong>State B</strong> defines rural elderly as Medicare beneficiaries 65 and older residing in areas meeting HRSA shortage area criteria. This produces a smaller count, focuses on areas with documented access barriers, but excludes elderly populations in technically non-shortage areas who nonetheless face significant access challenges.</p>
<p>Neither definition is wrong. Both are incomplete. <strong>The choice between them is a policy decision disguised as a technical one.</strong> States making these choices rarely acknowledge the implications, and RHTP guidance provides no framework for consistent decision-making across states.</p>
<p>The identification challenges vary systematically by population type:</p>
<p><strong>Demographic populations</strong> (elderly, children) present fewest challenges because Census data provides reliable counts by age and geography. Definitions are standardized and data is current.</p>
<p><strong>Geographic populations</strong> (frontier, Appalachian, Black Belt) depend entirely on which classification system applies. A county may be frontier under USDA definitions but not under Census rural classifications. Different definitions produce different counts.</p>
<p><strong>Condition-based populations</strong> (SUD, SMI, complex medical conditions) rely on surveys, treatment data, or claims analysis that systematically undercount. Those not in treatment are invisible. Those without insurance generate no claims.</p>
<p><strong>Circumstance-based populations</strong> (farmworkers, justice-involved, veterans) exist through administrative systems that capture only portions of actual populations. Farmworkers who avoid documentation are uncounted. Veterans who never register with VA are invisible to VA data.</p>
<p><strong>Legally-defined populations</strong> (tribal members) require navigating multiple overlapping definitions with different federal authorities and different service implications.</p>

<p><strong>Census Undercounts</strong></p>
<p>The decennial Census and American Community Survey systematically undercount specific populations. The Census Bureau estimates net undercounts of:</p>
<ul>
<li>American Indian and Alaska Native populations on reservations: approximately 5.6%</li>
<li>Hispanic populations: approximately 4.9%</li>
<li>Children under age 5: approximately 2.8%</li>
<li>Rural populations overall: approximately 1.5%</li>
</ul>
<p>These undercounts compound when populations overlap. An American Indian child on a rural reservation faces multiplicative undercount risk. <strong>State planners using Census data as denominators should adjust for known undercounts when available.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Administrative Data Limitations</strong></p>
<p>Administrative data captures only populations touching specific systems. This creates systematic biases:</p>
<p><strong>Treatment data</strong> identifies those receiving services, not those needing them. SUD prevalence estimates based on treatment admissions miss the majority of individuals with substance use disorders who never enter treatment. Rural treatment gaps mean rural prevalence estimates from treatment data are particularly unreliable.</p>
<p><strong>Claims data</strong> identifies insured populations. The uninsured generate no claims. In states without Medicaid expansion, low-income adults may have conditions never documented in claims data. Complex condition identification from claims systematically excludes rural uninsured populations.</p>
<p><strong>Enrollment data</strong> identifies those who register. Veterans must actively register with VA to appear in VA data. Rural veterans, particularly younger veterans and those without service-connected disabilities, register at lower rates than urban veterans.</p>
<p><strong>Survey Data Challenges</strong></p>
<p>SAMHSA&rsquo;s National Survey on Drug Use and Health provides the primary prevalence estimates for SUD and SMI. Survey methodology creates rural-specific limitations:</p>
<p><strong>Sample sizes</strong> in rural areas are small, producing large confidence intervals around rural prevalence estimates. State-level rural estimates may be based on fewer than 100 respondents.</p>
<p><strong>Response rates</strong> differ between rural and urban populations. Whether rural populations are more or less likely to report stigmatized conditions remains debated.</p>
<p><strong>Survey timing</strong> creates point-in-time estimates that may not capture seasonal variation in migrant populations or condition patterns.</p>

<h3 id="population-size-uncertainty">Population Size Uncertainty<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#population-size-uncertainty">#</a></h3>
<p>The ranges above mask substantial uncertainty that RHTP planners must acknowledge. Consider three populations with particularly problematic estimates:</p>
<p><strong>Farmworkers:</strong> The National Center for Farmworker Health estimates 2.4 million farmworkers nationally, with approximately 70% residing in rural areas during peak agricultural seasons. However, undocumented workers avoid enumeration, seasonal workers may be counted in multiple locations or none, and the distinction between farmworkers and agricultural laborers varies by data source. <strong>True rural farmworker population may be 20-40% higher than estimates suggest.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Justice-Involved:</strong> Bureau of Justice Statistics reports 5.5 million adults under correctional supervision nationally. Rural residence estimates derive from offense location, release location, and survey data with significant missing information. Post-supervision populations are essentially invisible to administrative data. A person who completed probation five years ago and now lives in a rural community with health needs related to incarceration history appears in no justice-involved population count.</p>
<p><strong>Autism/IDD:</strong> CDC&rsquo;s Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network estimates 1 in 36 children has autism spectrum disorder. However, ADDM sites are primarily metropolitan, and rural areas have documented diagnostic delays and underdiagnosis. Applying national prevalence to rural populations likely overstates identified cases while understating true prevalence. <strong>The rural autism population may be simultaneously undercounted (true prevalence) and overcounted (diagnosed prevalence) depending on which measure matters for service planning.</strong></p>

<h3 id="analytical-implications">Analytical Implications<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#analytical-implications">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Compound disadvantage is not additive.</strong> An elderly veteran in frontier Montana does not face elderly challenges plus veteran challenges plus frontier challenges in simple combination. The intersection creates qualitatively different circumstances. The veteran&rsquo;s VA benefits exist in name only when the nearest VA facility is 200 miles away. The elderly person&rsquo;s Medicare coverage provides little when no providers accept Medicare within driving distance. <strong>Each additional population membership does not add to disadvantage proportionally; it multiplies barriers.</strong></p>
<p><strong>System coordination failures concentrate at intersections.</strong> A tribal member with SMI living in a persistent poverty county navigates IHS (tribal health), state mental health authority (SMI services), and potentially Medicaid (if expansion state) or no coverage (if non-expansion state). Each system has different eligibility criteria, different providers, different electronic records, and different geographic boundaries. <strong>The person most in need of coordinated care is least likely to receive it because multiple systems claim partial responsibility while none assumes full accountability.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Program design rarely acknowledges intersectionality.</strong> RHTP applications describe services for elderly populations and services for SUD populations as separate workstreams. The elderly person with alcohol use disorder receives neither geriatric-informed addiction treatment nor addiction-informed geriatric care. <strong>Categorical program design produces categorical service delivery that fragments care for people whose needs do not fit single categories.</strong></p>

<p>RHTP implementation requires states to translate national population estimates into state-specific service planning. The guidance below provides methodology for state-level population estimation.</p>
<h3 id="step-1-establish-geographic-baseline">Step 1: Establish Geographic Baseline<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#step-1-establish-geographic-baseline">#</a></h3>
<p>Define &ldquo;rural&rdquo; consistently for all population estimates. Options include:</p>
<p><strong>Census Rural-Urban Continuum Codes (RUCC):</strong> Nine-category classification from metropolitan to completely rural. Most states use RUCC codes 4-9 or 7-9 depending on program requirements.</p>
<p><strong>HRSA Rural Health Information Hub definition:</strong> Nonmetropolitan counties plus metropolitan census tracts meeting specific population density criteria.</p>
<p><strong>State-specific definition:</strong> Some states have statutory rural definitions that may not align with federal classifications.</p>
<p><strong>Whatever definition selected, apply it consistently across all population estimates.</strong> Mixing definitions produces population estimates that cannot be summed or compared.</p>

<li>Pull total population for designated areas</li>
<li>Note overlap with state&rsquo;s rural definition</li>
<li>Confidence: High for designated populations; geographic overlap may create confusion</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For tribal populations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Contact state tribal liaison and individual tribal governments</li>
<li>Obtain IHS user population data for state</li>
<li>Pull Census AIAN data for rural geography</li>
<li>Reconcile differences (IHS eligible vs. self-identified vs. residing in state)</li>

<li>Adjust for state-specific factors (e.g., opioid prescribing rates, treatment availability)</li>
<li>Cross-reference with treatment data as floor estimate</li>
<li>Confidence: Low to moderate; prevalence estimates imprecise, treatment data undercounts</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For circumstance-based populations (farmworkers, justice-involved):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Obtain state-specific administrative data where available</li>
<li>Apply multipliers for undocumented/uncounted populations</li>
<li>Acknowledge uncertainty in planning documents</li>

<h3 id="step-3-assess-intersectionality">Step 3: Assess Intersectionality<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#step-3-assess-intersectionality">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Identify populations with significant state overlap</li>
<li>Estimate intersection sizes using national ratios where state data unavailable</li>
<li>Design service delivery that addresses compound disadvantage</li>
<li>Build coordination mechanisms between systems serving overlapping populations</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-4-document-methodology-and-limitations">Step 4: Document Methodology and Limitations<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#step-4-document-methodology-and-limitations">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Every state population estimate should include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Definition used for each population category</li>
<li>Data sources and vintage</li>
<li>Known limitations and biases</li>
<li>Confidence level assessment</li>
<li>Comparison to alternative estimates where available</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Documentation enables accountability.</strong> When state plans claim to serve a population of a certain size, documentation enables evaluation of whether services actually reached that population. Without transparent methodology, evaluation is impossible.</p>

<p>Federal data provides baseline but state sources often offer greater specificity:</p>
<p><strong>State health departments</strong> maintain vital statistics, disease registries, and sometimes state-specific health surveys with better rural coverage than national surveys.</p>
<p><strong>State Medicaid agencies</strong> have detailed enrollment and claims data that CMS aggregates mask. State-level requests can produce rural-specific utilization patterns.</p>
<p><strong>State departments of corrections</strong> maintain incarceration and supervision data with residence information that BJS aggregates cannot provide.</p>
<p><strong>State labor departments</strong> may have farmworker program data beyond federal sources.</p>
<p><strong>State mental health authorities</strong> have data on public mental health system utilization not captured in national surveys.</p>
<p><strong>Tribal governments</strong> maintain enrollment data more accurate than Census estimates for specific tribal nations.</p>

<h3 id="for-state-rhtp-planners">For State RHTP Planners<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#for-state-rhtp-planners">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Use consistent definitions.</strong> Select rural classification and population definitions that apply throughout your application and implementation. Document selections explicitly.</p>
<p><strong>Acknowledge uncertainty.</strong> Precision implies false accuracy. Report ranges where appropriate, identify confidence levels, and explain limitations.</p>
<p><strong>Plan for intersectionality.</strong> Design services that address compound disadvantage, not just categorical populations.</p>
<p><strong>Build local partnerships.</strong> Community organizations, tribal governments, and advocacy groups often have population knowledge that administrative data cannot capture.</p>
<p><strong>Update estimates regularly.</strong> Population distributions change. Annual reassessment using updated sources improves targeting.</p>
<h3 id="for-federal-rhtp-oversight">For Federal RHTP Oversight<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#for-federal-rhtp-oversight">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Provide definitional guidance.</strong> States make different definitional choices producing non-comparable results. Standardized guidance would enable cross-state comparison.</p>
<p><strong>Fund improved rural data collection.</strong> National surveys have inadequate rural sample sizes. Dedicated rural health surveys would improve prevalence estimates.</p>
<p><strong>Require intersection analysis.</strong> Applications that address populations separately perpetuate categorical thinking that fails people with compound disadvantage.</p>
<p><strong>Support tribal data sovereignty.</strong> Tribal nations should control how their population data is collected, analyzed, and shared.</p>
<h3 id="for-researchers">For Researchers<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#for-researchers">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Report rural subgroup analyses.</strong> When study populations include rural participants, report rural-specific findings even with smaller sample sizes.</p>
<p><strong>Develop rural prevalence adjustments.</strong> Research establishing how national prevalence estimates should be adjusted for rural populations would substantially improve state planning.</p>
<p><strong>Study intersectionality empirically.</strong> The compound disadvantage framework is theoretically sound but empirical estimation of intersection effects remains limited.</p>
