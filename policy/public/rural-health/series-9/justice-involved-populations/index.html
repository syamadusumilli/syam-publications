  "articleBody": "Every year, more than 650,000 people return to communities from state and federal prisons. Approximately 10 million jail admissions occur annually, with most individuals returning to communities within weeks or months. These transitions create healthcare discontinuities that compound already-elevated health needs. People leave incarceration with chronic conditions undertreated, mental illness unmanaged, substance use disorders unaddressed, and medications expiring within days of release.\nThe core tension this article examines is population visibility versus population need. Justice-involved populations have among the highest healthcare needs of any group: chronic disease rates exceeding general population, mental illness prevalence reaching 50% or higher, substance use disorder histories characterizing the majority, and mortality risk spiking dramatically in the weeks following release. They also have among the lowest political visibility and support. They cannot vote in many states. They are stigmatized. Political systems do not reward investment in people society has designated for punishment.\nThis tension shapes everything about reentry health. Need is extreme. Support is minimal. The political calculation is clear: justice-involved health investment generates no electoral return and risks accusations of coddling criminals. RHTP’s promise to transform rural health for “all rural residents” tests whether transformation can reach populations that politics renders invisible and morality debates render controversial.\nWhat analytical value does this article add beyond population description? It examines whether RHTP can address healthcare transitions that cross system boundaries, assesses which state approaches recognize versus ignore reentry health needs, and identifies what genuine continuity would require versus what carceral systems and healthcare systems are each willing to provide.\nPopulation Profile Definition and Categories Justice-involved populations encompass multiple categories with distinct healthcare circumstances:\nPopulation Categories:\nCategory Definition Estimated Population Currently Incarcerated Held in state/federal prisons or local jails ~1.9 million Recently Released Released within past 12 months ~650,000 annually (prisons) On Supervision Parole, probation, or community supervision ~3.7 million Justice History Prior incarceration affecting current access ~19 million living Rural Jail Population Incarcerated in rural county jails ~200,000+ These categories overlap and transition. A person may move from jail to prison to supervised release to parole completion, each transition creating new healthcare system interfaces. The rural dimension is significant: rural communities contain both rural jails (often smaller, with fewer health resources) and receive returning citizens from both rural and urban facilities.\nHealth Burden Profile People who experience incarceration carry disproportionate health burdens that predate, continue during, and are exacerbated by justice system involvement.\nHealth Status Comparisons:\nCondition Justice-Involved General Population Gap Source Any Mental Health Condition 44% 19% +25% BJS Serious Mental Illness 14-24% 5% +9-19% BJS Substance Use Disorder History 65%+ 8% +57%+ SAMHSA Chronic Condition (any) 50%+ 40% +10%+ Research Hepatitis C 17% 1% +16% CDC HIV 1.3% 0.4% +0.9% CDC Diabetes 9% 10% ~same Research Hypertension 30%+ 30% ~same Research Tuberculosis 5x higher baseline 5x CDC Dental Disease 60%+ untreated 15% +45%+ Research Mental illness prevalence is particularly striking. Studies consistently find that 44% or more of people in jails and prisons have mental health conditions, with serious mental illness (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, severe depression) affecting 14 to 24% depending on facility type and assessment methodology. The prevalence in jails exceeds prisons because jails hold people with acute mental health crises that would previously have resulted in psychiatric hospitalization.\nSubstance use disorder characterizes the majority of justice-involved populations. An estimated 65% or more have substance use disorder histories, with opioid use disorder, alcohol use disorder, and stimulant use disorder particularly prevalent. The intersection of SUD and mental illness (co-occurring disorders) is common, creating treatment needs that neither carceral systems nor community healthcare systems adequately address.\nRural Dimensions Rural communities experience justice involvement distinctly from urban areas:\nRural Jail Characteristics:\nSmaller facilities with fewer health resources Less access to on-site medical and mental health staff Limited medication-assisted treatment availability Longer distances to specialty care Less frequent contract physician visits Fewer community reentry services upon release Rural Reentry Challenges:\nReturning to communities with minimal healthcare infrastructure Transportation barriers to distant services Behavioral health treatment deserts Limited housing options Fewer employment opportunities Weaker social service networks Approximately 200,000 or more individuals are held in rural county jails at any given time. These facilities often operate with minimal healthcare capacity. A rural jail might have a nurse available 8 hours daily with physician visits weekly or less frequently. Psychiatric services may require transport to distant facilities. Medication continuity depends on systems that rural jails may lack capacity to maintain.\nDemographic Characteristics Justice-involved populations reflect systemic inequities in criminal justice processing:\nDemographic Profile:\nCharacteristic Prison Population General Population Source Male 93% 49% BJS Black 38% 13% BJS Hispanic 21% 19% BJS Age 25-44 55% 27% BJS No HS Diploma 41% 12% BJS Pre-Incarceration Poverty 50%+ 12% Research The intersection of race, poverty, and justice involvement shapes population health. Communities with high incarceration rates experience both individual health impacts and community-level effects as family members, economic providers, and community participants are removed and return. Mass incarceration concentrates in specific neighborhoods, creating cumulative disadvantage that compounds across generations.\nHealthcare During Incarceration Constitutional Requirements The 1976 Supreme Court decision Estelle v. Gamble established that the Eighth Amendment prohibits deliberate indifference to serious medical needs of incarcerated people. This constitutional requirement means that carceral facilities must provide healthcare, creating one of the few contexts in America where healthcare is legally guaranteed regardless of ability to pay.\nHowever, constitutional floors do not equal adequate care:\nReality of Carceral Healthcare:\nAspect Legal Requirement Typical Reality Access to Care Cannot be deliberately indifferent Long waits, gatekeeping, care delays Quality of Care Not constitutionally defined Variable, often inadequate Mental Health Must treat serious mental illness Psychiatric boarding, medication only SUD Treatment Evolving legal requirements MAT often unavailable Chronic Disease Must address serious conditions Interrupted medications, limited monitoring Specialty Care Cannot ignore serious needs Delayed referrals, denied access Rural jails face particular challenges in meeting even minimal healthcare standards. With smaller budgets, fewer staff, and less bargaining power with healthcare contractors, rural jails often provide care that larger facilities would consider inadequate. A rural county jail may have difficulty attracting any medical provider willing to serve the facility.\nMedication-Assisted Treatment Access Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorder during incarceration has expanded following legal challenges and policy changes, but access remains incomplete:\nMAT Availability:\nFacility Type Offering MAT Full MAT Access Source State Prisons ~70% some ~30% all meds Prison Policy Local Jails ~30% some ~15% all meds Estimates Federal Prisons ~40% some ~20% all meds BOP Most facilities that offer MAT provide only naltrexone (often injectable Vivitrol), which does not require DEA licensing and cannot be diverted. Buprenorphine and methadone, often more effective for many patients, remain less available due to regulatory barriers, diversion concerns, and ideological opposition to medication-based treatment.\nFor people stable on MAT prior to incarceration, forced withdrawal upon entry creates immediate crisis. For people who could benefit from MAT initiation during incarceration, absence of services means untreated addiction. For both groups, release without MAT continuity produces overdose risk.\nThe Incarceration Health Paradox Incarceration produces a paradoxical health effect: some health measures improve during incarceration (housing stability, regular meals, reduced substance access, healthcare access however inadequate), while other measures worsen (mental health from isolation, chronic stress, violence exposure, inadequate disease management).\nThe health gains of incarceration are temporary and artificial. They do not represent genuine improvement but rather reflect controlled conditions that cannot persist upon release. A person whose blood pressure improves with regular medication during incarceration will likely see it rise again if medication access disappears upon release.\nTransition and Reentry The Deadly Period The weeks following release from incarceration represent the highest-risk period for justice-involved populations. Research documents dramatically elevated mortality risk immediately post-release:\nPost-Release Mortality:\nPeriod Relative Risk Primary Causes Source Week 1-2 12.7x baseline Overdose, homicide, suicide Binswanger et al. Month 1 3.5x baseline Overdose, cardiovascular Multiple studies Year 1 2.0x baseline All causes elevated Multiple studies Opioid overdose drives much of the immediate post-release mortality. Tolerance to opioids decreases during incarceration (whether through forced abstinence or MAT). Upon release, individuals who resume opioid use at pre-incarceration levels face extreme overdose risk because their bodies no longer tolerate previous doses. The first two weeks post-release are particularly dangerous.\nMedicaid Coverage Disruption The federal Inmate Payment Exclusion prohibits Medicaid from paying for services provided during incarceration (except inpatient hospitalization exceeding 24 hours). This policy does not make incarcerated individuals ineligible for Medicaid; rather, it prevents federal payment during incarceration.\nStates respond to this policy in two ways:\nState Approaches to Medicaid During Incarceration:\nApproach Process Post-Release Impact Termination End Medicaid enrollment at incarceration Must reapply after release; coverage gaps Suspension Pause enrollment during incarceration Faster reinstatement; still delays possible Historically, most states terminated Medicaid enrollment, requiring released individuals to reapply from scratch. Beginning January 1, 2026, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2024 requires all states to suspend rather than terminate Medicaid coverage. This federal mandate represents significant progress but does not eliminate coverage gaps.\nEven with suspension, bureaucratic delays, system disconnects, and administrative barriers produce coverage lapses. Studies find that even in suspension states, released individuals frequently experience days to weeks without active coverage while reinstatement processes complete. During this gap, healthcare access depends on ability to pay out-of-pocket or charity care availability.\nSection 1115 Reentry Demonstrations CMS has encouraged states to pursue Section 1115 demonstration waivers enabling Medicaid coverage for pre-release services. As of August 2024, eleven states have received approval: California, Illinois, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Montana, Oregon, Utah, Vermont, Washington, and others. Additional states have applications pending.\nThese demonstrations allow limited Medicaid payment for services in the 90 days prior to release, including:\nPhysical and behavioral health screening Treatment for chronic conditions Care coordination and discharge planning Connection to community providers Medication bridging California will be the first state to implement its reentry demonstration in October 2024, potentially informing other states’ approaches. The demonstrations require states to reinvest federal matching funds received for carceral health services into activities improving access and quality for justice-involved populations.\nHowever, rural jails often lack capacity to participate in these demonstrations. The administrative requirements, data sharing systems, and provider networks required for effective pre-release services exceed what many rural counties can implement without significant technical assistance.\nVignette: Marcus Returns to Greene County Marcus, 34, spent six months in Greene County Jail awaiting trial and then disposition for drug possession. He has type 2 diabetes, major depression, and opioid use disorder. Before arrest, he managed diabetes with metformin and depression with sertraline, obtained through a community health center sliding-fee program. He was not in treatment for opioid use but was contemplating it.\nThe jail’s contracted nurse visits twice weekly. She continues his metformin and sertraline but cannot initiate MAT; the jail has no MAT program. Marcus experiences opioid withdrawal in the first week, managed with comfort medications but no treatment for the underlying disorder. His depression deepens in jail’s isolation. His diabetes control worsens as jail meals do not accommodate diabetic dietary needs and exercise opportunities are minimal.\nUpon release, Marcus receives a two-week supply of metformin but no prescription he can refill. His sertraline runs out; the jail did not provide any. His Medicaid, suspended during incarceration, shows as inactive when he attempts to use it at a pharmacy three days post-release.\nGreene County has no behavioral health provider. The community health center where Marcus previously received care has a six-week wait for returning patients. The nearest MAT provider is 45 miles away and not accepting new patients. Marcus has no vehicle; public transportation does not exist in Greene County.\nWithin the first week, Marcus’s diabetes medication supply dwindles. His depression, untreated, deepens. The stress of reentry without housing, employment, or support intensifies cravings. He knows people who use. He knows where to find opioids.\nTwo weeks post-release, Marcus experiences a diabetic crisis requiring emergency transport to a hospital 30 miles away. He is stabilized and discharged with prescriptions but no means to fill them and no follow-up care arranged. His Medicaid remains in processing limbo.\nAt week three, Marcus relapses. His tolerance has decreased during six months of forced abstinence. The dose that would have produced euphoria before incarceration produces respiratory depression now. A friend finds him unresponsive and calls 911. The rural EMS response time is 22 minutes. Marcus survives, barely, with permanent anoxic brain injury.\nWhat would continuity look like? Pre-release care coordination identifying his conditions and community resources. Medicaid activated before release, not weeks after. Medication supplies exceeding two weeks. MAT offered during incarceration and continued upon release. Behavioral health appointment scheduled before release. Transportation assistance to reach services. A reentry plan that recognized him as a person with healthcare needs, not merely a former inmate to be released.\nAlternative Perspectives The Political Prioritization Reality Justice-involved populations have minimal political support. They cannot vote in many states during incarceration and sometimes for years after. They are stigmatized as criminals undeserving of investment. Political systems do not reward serving people society has designated for punishment. Investing in reentry health generates no electoral return and risks accusations of misplaced compassion.\nAssessment: This view accurately describes political reality. It does not follow that political reality should determine healthcare policy. People emerging from incarceration are returning community members whose health affects family, community, and public safety. Untreated mental illness produces crises. Untreated addiction produces overdose and crime. Unmanaged chronic disease produces emergency department visits taxpayers fund anyway. The question is not whether to pay for justice-involved healthcare but when and how: proactively through continuity, or reactively through crisis response.\nThe Public Safety View Some argue that reentry health investment serves public safety by reducing recidivism. People with access to mental health treatment, substance use treatment, and chronic disease management are less likely to return to criminal behavior. Framing reentry health as public safety investment may generate support that humanitarian framing cannot.\nAssessment: Evidence supports connections between healthcare access and reduced recidivism. Research finds that Medicaid enrollment reduces re-arrest rates, particularly for multi-time offenders. States with Medicaid expansion report fewer violent crime and drug arrests within the first three years of expansion. However, instrumentalizing healthcare as crime prevention tools carries risks: it makes healthcare contingent on demonstrated crime reduction rather than recognizing healthcare as intrinsically warranted for all people. Justice-involved individuals deserve healthcare because they are people, not because treating them reduces their criminal behavior.\nThe Moral Desert View Others argue that people who commit crimes forfeit claims to public investment. Resources directed to justice-involved populations could serve law-abiding citizens whose needs also go unmet. Limited healthcare resources should prioritize people who have not violated social norms.\nAssessment: This view reflects genuine moral intuitions held by substantial portions of the public. It does not withstand scrutiny. First, incarceration itself is the designated punishment; additional suffering through healthcare denial is extrajudicial punishment not authorized by any sentence. Second, the moral desert view ignores how justice system involvement reflects structural factors (poverty, mental illness, addiction, educational failure) that individuals did not choose. Third, released individuals are returning community members whose health affects others regardless of their prior behavior. Fourth, constitutional requirements mandate healthcare during incarceration, making the moral desert view legally irrelevant within carceral settings and practically irrelevant upon release when individuals rejoin communities entitled to functional healthcare systems.\nRHTP Relevance Current State Approaches State RHTP applications vary dramatically in their recognition of justice-involved populations:\nState Approaches to Justice-Involved Health:\nState Recognition Specific Provisions Assessment California Explicit CalAIM justice-involved ECM Most developed Kentucky Explicit Pre-release linkage programs Substantial Massachusetts Mentioned Reentry coordination Moderate North Carolina Mentioned Prison Medicaid enrollment Moderate Texas Minimal General rural focus Inadequate Mississippi Absent No justice provisions None Alabama Absent No justice provisions None California’s approach integrates justice-involved populations into Enhanced Care Management (ECM) under CalAIM, identifying people transitioning from incarceration as a priority population requiring intensive care coordination. This approach recognizes that reentry creates healthcare needs that standard systems cannot address.\nKentucky has pursued Section 1115 reentry demonstration approval and operates programs connecting incarcerated individuals to community services before release. The state’s approach acknowledges that healthcare continuity requires action before release, not merely after.\nMost states, however, treat “rural residents” as a homogeneous category without distinguishing populations with distinct healthcare transition needs. Justice-involved individuals are rural residents, but their healthcare needs during reentry differ from needs of settled community members with continuous coverage and established provider relationships.\nWhat RHTP Could Provide RHTP’s flexible structure could support reentry health if states chose this priority:\nPotential RHTP Applications:\nPre-release care coordination programs in rural jails Medicaid enrollment assistance during incarceration MAT expansion in rural carceral facilities Reentry health navigation services Telehealth connecting rural released individuals to behavioral health Community health worker programs targeting reentry populations RHTP funding could support rural jail health capacity building that current criminal justice funding streams cannot provide. It could fund reentry specialists positioned in rural communities receiving returning citizens. It could support telehealth infrastructure enabling behavioral health access where in-person providers do not exist.\nWhat RHTP Cannot Provide Fundamental barriers lie beyond RHTP’s scope:\nWhat RHTP Cannot Provide:\nPolitical priority for stigmatized population Resolution of criminal justice system issues Immediate community infrastructure where none exists Housing stability and employment opportunity Social support networks Change in public attitudes toward formerly incarcerated RHTP can improve healthcare systems; it cannot address the social determinants that produce both incarceration and poor health outcomes. A person released to a rural community without housing, employment, transportation, or social support faces barriers that healthcare transformation alone cannot overcome.\nHonest Assessment RHTP is unlikely to prioritize justice-involved populations regardless of need because political systems do not reward serving people who are politically invisible and socially stigmatized. States will fund popular interventions serving sympathetic populations. Justice-involved individuals are neither popular nor sympathetic in public perception.\nFor RHTP to serve justice-involved populations, specific design choices are required:\nExplicit identification of justice-involved individuals as a target population Collaboration requirements between health agencies and corrections departments Pre-release service authorization enabling healthcare before release Medicaid enrollment integration with release planning processes Behavioral health prioritization recognizing high mental health and SUD needs Rural jail inclusion despite capacity limitations Without these design choices, RHTP will transform rural health for populations whose needs are visible while leaving invisible populations behind.\nIntersectionality Considerations Justice-involved populations intersect with other categories creating compound disadvantage:\nIntersecting Populations:\nIntersection Compound Effect Estimated Population Justice-Involved + SUD Reentry overdose risk, treatment gap ~750,000 Justice-Involved + SMI Cycling through jails, crisis care ~300,000 Justice-Involved + Rural Transportation barriers, service absence ~200,000+ Justice-Involved + Black Belt Historical discrimination compounds Variable Justice-Involved + Veterans VA coordination challenges ~180,000 Justice-Involved + Elderly Aging behind bars, healthcare needs ~200,000 The intersection of justice involvement and substance use disorder creates the highest immediate risk. Post-release overdose mortality reflects this intersection: people with SUD, tolerance reduced during incarceration, released without MAT continuation, returning to environments where substances are available. This intersection kills people in the weeks following release.\nThe intersection of justice involvement and serious mental illness produces cycling through jails, emergency departments, and streets. People with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and severe depression experience incarceration at rates vastly exceeding their population proportion. Rural communities lack psychiatric services that could divert from incarceration or treat upon release.\nWhat Transformation Requires Necessary Conditions Genuine transformation for justice-involved populations requires:\nPre-Release Planning:\nHealthcare needs assessment before release Medicaid enrollment completed before release Medication supply exceeding 30 days at release Community provider appointment scheduled before release Care coordination connecting carceral and community providers Community Infrastructure:\nBehavioral health services in rural communities receiving releases MAT providers accessible without multi-week waits Primary care accepting new patients with complex needs Transportation to reach services Housing supporting health stability System Coordination:\nData sharing between corrections and Medicaid agencies Real-time notification systems for release dates Provider networks spanning carceral and community settings Accountability for post-release outcomes What Transformation Cannot Provide RHTP cannot resolve fundamental contradictions in American approaches to incarceration and health:\nWhat Transformation Cannot Provide:\nResolution of mass incarceration Adequate carceral healthcare funding Political support for stigmatized populations Housing and employment that stabilize health Change in public attitudes toward punishment Immediate workforce where none exists Conclusion Justice-involved populations experience healthcare discontinuities that transform high-need individuals into crisis events. The transition from incarceration to community creates gaps that existing systems are not designed to bridge. Medicaid coverage lapses. Medications run out. Behavioral health needs go unmet. Overdose claims lives in the weeks that policy neglects.\nRHTP could address some of these gaps. Pre-release care coordination, Medicaid enrollment assistance, MAT expansion, and reentry navigation are all within RHTP’s potential scope. States could designate justice-involved populations as priority groups. Rural jails could receive capacity building. Community health workers could support reentry transitions.\nThey probably will not. Political systems do not reward serving invisible, stigmatized populations. States will pursue interventions that generate political support, and supporting people emerging from incarceration generates opposition, not support. The mathematical need is clear; the political will is absent.\nThe residents emerging from rural jails and returning to rural communities deserve healthcare continuity. They also deserve acknowledgment that their current treatment reflects not their healthcare needs but political judgments about whose suffering matters. Some populations are visible; systems respond. Others are invisible; gaps persist.

</div>

<p>Every year, more than <strong>650,000 people return to communities from state and federal prisons</strong>. Approximately <strong>10 million jail admissions</strong> occur annually, with most individuals returning to communities within weeks or months. These transitions create healthcare discontinuities that compound already-elevated health needs. People leave incarceration with chronic conditions undertreated, mental illness unmanaged, substance use disorders unaddressed, and medications expiring within days of release.</p>
<p>The core tension this article examines is <strong>population visibility versus population need</strong>. Justice-involved populations have among the highest healthcare needs of any group: chronic disease rates exceeding general population, mental illness prevalence reaching 50% or higher, substance use disorder histories characterizing the majority, and mortality risk spiking dramatically in the weeks following release. They also have among the lowest political visibility and support. They cannot vote in many states. They are stigmatized. Political systems do not reward investment in people society has designated for punishment.</p>
<p>This tension shapes everything about reentry health. Need is extreme. Support is minimal. The political calculation is clear: justice-involved health investment generates no electoral return and risks accusations of coddling criminals. RHTP&rsquo;s promise to transform rural health for &ldquo;all rural residents&rdquo; tests whether transformation can reach populations that politics renders invisible and morality debates render controversial.</p>
<p>What analytical value does this article add beyond population description? It examines whether <strong>RHTP can address healthcare transitions that cross system boundaries</strong>, assesses which state approaches recognize versus ignore reentry health needs, and identifies what genuine continuity would require versus what carceral systems and healthcare systems are each willing to provide.</p>

<p>These categories overlap and transition. A person may move from jail to prison to supervised release to parole completion, each transition creating new healthcare system interfaces.

<p><strong>Mental illness prevalence</strong> is particularly striking. Studies consistently find that <strong>44% or more of people in jails and prisons have mental health conditions</strong>, with serious mental illness (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, severe depression) affecting 14 to 24% depending on facility type and assessment methodology. The prevalence in jails exceeds prisons because jails hold people with acute mental health crises that would previously have resulted in psychiatric hospitalization.</p>
<p><strong>Substance use disorder</strong> characterizes the majority of justice-involved populations. An estimated <strong>65% or more have substance use disorder histories</strong>, with opioid use disorder, alcohol use disorder, and stimulant use disorder particularly prevalent. The intersection of SUD and mental illness (co-occurring disorders) is common, creating treatment needs that neither carceral systems nor community healthcare systems adequately address.</p>
<h3 id="rural-dimensions">Rural Dimensions<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#rural-dimensions">#</a></h3>
<p>Rural communities experience justice involvement distinctly from urban areas:</p>
<p><strong>Rural Jail Characteristics:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Smaller facilities with fewer health resources</li>
<li>Less access to on-site medical and mental health staff</li>
<li>Limited medication-assisted treatment availability</li>
<li>Longer distances to specialty care</li>
<li>Less frequent contract physician visits</li>
<li>Fewer community reentry services upon release</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rural Reentry Challenges:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Returning to communities with minimal healthcare infrastructure</li>
<li>Transportation barriers to distant services</li>
<li>Behavioral health treatment deserts</li>
<li>Limited housing options</li>
<li>Fewer employment opportunities</li>
<li>Weaker social service networks</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Approximately 200,000 or more individuals</strong> are held in rural county jails at any given time. These facilities often operate with minimal healthcare capacity. A rural jail might have a nurse available 8 hours daily with physician visits weekly or less frequently. Psychiatric services may require transport to distant facilities. Medication continuity depends on systems that rural jails may lack capacity to maintain.</p>

<p>The intersection of <strong>race, poverty, and justice involvement</strong> shapes population health. Communities with high incarceration rates experience both individual health impacts and community-level effects as family members, economic providers, and community participants are removed and return. Mass incarceration concentrates in specific neighborhoods, creating cumulative disadvantage that compounds across generations.</p>

<p><strong>Rural jails face particular challenges</strong> in meeting even minimal healthcare standards. With smaller budgets, fewer staff, and less bargaining power with healthcare contractors, rural jails often provide care that larger facilities would consider inadequate. A rural county jail may have difficulty attracting any medical provider willing to serve the facility.</p>

<p>Most facilities that offer MAT provide only <strong>naltrexone</strong> (often injectable Vivitrol), which does not require DEA licensing and cannot be diverted. <strong>Buprenorphine and methadone</strong>, often more effective for many patients, remain less available due to regulatory barriers, diversion concerns, and ideological opposition to medication-based treatment.</p>
<p>For people stable on MAT prior to incarceration, <strong>forced withdrawal</strong> upon entry creates immediate crisis. For people who could benefit from MAT initiation during incarceration, <strong>absence of services</strong> means untreated addiction. For both groups, release without MAT continuity produces overdose risk.</p>
<h3 id="the-incarceration-health-paradox">The Incarceration Health Paradox<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-incarceration-health-paradox">#</a></h3>
<p>Incarceration produces a paradoxical health effect: <strong>some health measures improve during incarceration</strong> (housing stability, regular meals, reduced substance access, healthcare access however inadequate), while <strong>other measures worsen</strong> (mental health from isolation, chronic stress, violence exposure, inadequate disease management).</p>
<p>The health gains of incarceration are temporary and artificial. They do not represent genuine improvement but rather reflect controlled conditions that cannot persist upon release. A person whose blood pressure improves with regular medication during incarceration will likely see it rise again if medication access disappears upon release.</p>

<p><strong>Opioid overdose</strong> drives much of the immediate post-release mortality. Tolerance to opioids decreases during incarceration (whether through forced abstinence or MAT). Upon release, individuals who resume opioid use at pre-incarceration levels face extreme overdose risk because their bodies no longer tolerate previous doses. The first two weeks post-release are particularly dangerous.</p>
<h3 id="medicaid-coverage-disruption">Medicaid Coverage Disruption<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#medicaid-coverage-disruption">#</a></h3>
<p>The federal <strong>Inmate Payment Exclusion</strong> prohibits Medicaid from paying for services provided during incarceration (except inpatient hospitalization exceeding 24 hours). This policy does not make incarcerated individuals ineligible for Medicaid; rather, it prevents federal payment during incarceration.</p>
<p>States respond to this policy in two ways:</p>
<p><strong>State Approaches to Medicaid During Incarceration:</strong></p>

          <td>Pause enrollment during incarceration</td>
          <td>Faster reinstatement; still delays possible</td>
      </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>Historically, most states terminated Medicaid enrollment, requiring released individuals to reapply from scratch. Beginning <strong>January 1, 2026</strong>, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2024 requires all states to suspend rather than terminate Medicaid coverage. This federal mandate represents significant progress but does not eliminate coverage gaps.</p>
<p>Even with suspension, <strong>bureaucratic delays, system disconnects, and administrative barriers</strong> produce coverage lapses. Studies find that even in suspension states, released individuals frequently experience days to weeks without active coverage while reinstatement processes complete. During this gap, healthcare access depends on ability to pay out-of-pocket or charity care availability.</p>
<h3 id="section-1115-reentry-demonstrations">Section 1115 Reentry Demonstrations<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#section-1115-reentry-demonstrations">#</a></h3>
<p>CMS has encouraged states to pursue <strong>Section 1115 demonstration waivers</strong> enabling Medicaid coverage for pre-release services. As of August 2024, <strong>eleven states have received approval</strong>: California, Illinois, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Montana, Oregon, Utah, Vermont, Washington, and others. Additional states have applications pending.</p>
<p>These demonstrations allow limited Medicaid payment for services in the <strong>90 days prior to release</strong>, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Physical and behavioral health screening</li>
<li>Treatment for chronic conditions</li>
<li>Care coordination and discharge planning</li>
<li>Connection to community providers</li>
<li>Medication bridging</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>California</strong> will be the first state to implement its reentry demonstration in October 2024, potentially informing other states&rsquo; approaches. The demonstrations require states to reinvest federal matching funds received for carceral health services into activities improving access and quality for justice-involved populations.</p>
<p>However, <strong>rural jails often lack capacity</strong> to participate in these demonstrations. The administrative requirements, data sharing systems, and provider networks required for effective pre-release services exceed what many rural counties can implement without significant technical assistance.</p>
<h3 id="vignette-marcus-returns-to-greene-county">Vignette: Marcus Returns to Greene County<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#vignette-marcus-returns-to-greene-county">#</a></h3>
<p>Marcus, 34, spent six months in Greene County Jail awaiting trial and then disposition for drug possession. He has type 2 diabetes, major depression, and opioid use disorder. Before arrest, he managed diabetes with metformin and depression with sertraline, obtained through a community health center sliding-fee program. He was not in treatment for opioid use but was contemplating it.</p>
<p>The jail&rsquo;s contracted nurse visits twice weekly. She continues his metformin and sertraline but cannot initiate MAT; the jail has no MAT program. Marcus experiences opioid withdrawal in the first week, managed with comfort medications but no treatment for the underlying disorder. His depression deepens in jail&rsquo;s isolation. His diabetes control worsens as jail meals do not accommodate diabetic dietary needs and exercise opportunities are minimal.</p>
<p>Upon release, Marcus receives a two-week supply of metformin but no prescription he can refill. His sertraline runs out; the jail did not provide any. His Medicaid, suspended during incarceration, shows as inactive when he attempts to use it at a pharmacy three days post-release.</p>
<p>Greene County has no behavioral health provider. The community health center where Marcus previously received care has a six-week wait for returning patients. The nearest MAT provider is 45 miles away and not accepting new patients. Marcus has no vehicle; public transportation does not exist in Greene County.</p>
<p>Within the first week, Marcus&rsquo;s diabetes medication supply dwindles. His depression, untreated, deepens. The stress of reentry without housing, employment, or support intensifies cravings. He knows people who use. He knows where to find opioids.</p>
<p>Two weeks post-release, Marcus experiences a diabetic crisis requiring emergency transport to a hospital 30 miles away. He is stabilized and discharged with prescriptions but no means to fill them and no follow-up care arranged. His Medicaid remains in processing limbo.</p>
<p>At week three, Marcus relapses. His tolerance has decreased during six months of forced abstinence. The dose that would have produced euphoria before incarceration produces respiratory depression now. A friend finds him unresponsive and calls 911. The rural EMS response time is 22 minutes. Marcus survives, barely, with permanent anoxic brain injury.</p>
<p><strong>What would continuity look like?</strong> Pre-release care coordination identifying his conditions and community resources. Medicaid activated before release, not weeks after. Medication supplies exceeding two weeks. MAT offered during incarceration and continued upon release. Behavioral health appointment scheduled before release. Transportation assistance to reach services. A reentry plan that recognized him as a person with healthcare needs, not merely a former inmate to be released.</p>

<h3 id="the-political-prioritization-reality">The Political Prioritization Reality<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-political-prioritization-reality">#</a></h3>
<p>Justice-involved populations have minimal political support. They cannot vote in many states during incarceration and sometimes for years after. They are stigmatized as criminals undeserving of investment. Political systems do not reward serving people society has designated for punishment. Investing in reentry health generates no electoral return and risks accusations of misplaced compassion.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment:</strong> This view accurately describes political reality. It does not follow that political reality should determine healthcare policy. People emerging from incarceration are returning community members whose health affects family, community, and public safety. Untreated mental illness produces crises. Untreated addiction produces overdose and crime. Unmanaged chronic disease produces emergency department visits taxpayers fund anyway. The question is not whether to pay for justice-involved healthcare but when and how: proactively through continuity, or reactively through crisis response.</p>
<h3 id="the-public-safety-view">The Public Safety View<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-public-safety-view">#</a></h3>
<p>Some argue that reentry health investment serves public safety by reducing recidivism. People with access to mental health treatment, substance use treatment, and chronic disease management are less likely to return to criminal behavior. Framing reentry health as public safety investment may generate support that humanitarian framing cannot.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment:</strong> Evidence supports connections between healthcare access and reduced recidivism. Research finds that Medicaid enrollment reduces re-arrest rates, particularly for multi-time offenders. States with Medicaid expansion report fewer violent crime and drug arrests within the first three years of expansion. However, instrumentalizing healthcare as crime prevention tools carries risks: it makes healthcare contingent on demonstrated crime reduction rather than recognizing healthcare as intrinsically warranted for all people. Justice-involved individuals deserve healthcare because they are people, not because treating them reduces their criminal behavior.</p>
<h3 id="the-moral-desert-view">The Moral Desert View<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-moral-desert-view">#</a></h3>
<p>Others argue that people who commit crimes forfeit claims to public investment. Resources directed to justice-involved populations could serve law-abiding citizens whose needs also go unmet. Limited healthcare resources should prioritize people who have not violated social norms.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment:</strong> This view reflects genuine moral intuitions held by substantial portions of the public. It does not withstand scrutiny. First, incarceration itself is the designated punishment; additional suffering through healthcare denial is extrajudicial punishment not authorized by any sentence. Second, the moral desert view ignores how justice system involvement reflects structural factors (poverty, mental illness, addiction, educational failure) that individuals did not choose. Third, released individuals are returning community members whose health affects others regardless of their prior behavior. Fourth, constitutional requirements mandate healthcare during incarceration, making the moral desert view legally irrelevant within carceral settings and practically irrelevant upon release when individuals rejoin communities entitled to functional healthcare systems.</p>

<p><strong>California&rsquo;s approach</strong> integrates justice-involved populations into Enhanced Care Management (ECM) under CalAIM, identifying people transitioning from incarceration as a priority population requiring intensive care coordination. This approach recognizes that reentry creates healthcare needs that standard systems cannot address.</p>
<p><strong>Kentucky</strong> has pursued Section 1115 reentry demonstration approval and operates programs connecting incarcerated individuals to community services before release. The state&rsquo;s approach acknowledges that healthcare continuity requires action before release, not merely after.</p>
<p>Most states, however, treat &ldquo;rural residents&rdquo; as a homogeneous category without distinguishing populations with distinct healthcare transition needs. Justice-involved individuals are rural residents, but their healthcare needs during reentry differ from needs of settled community members with continuous coverage and established provider relationships.</p>
<h3 id="what-rhtp-could-provide">What RHTP Could Provide<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-rhtp-could-provide">#</a></h3>
<p>RHTP&rsquo;s flexible structure could support reentry health if states chose this priority:</p>
<p><strong>Potential RHTP Applications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pre-release care coordination programs in rural jails</li>
<li>Medicaid enrollment assistance during incarceration</li>
<li>MAT expansion in rural carceral facilities</li>
<li>Reentry health navigation services</li>
<li>Telehealth connecting rural released individuals to behavioral health</li>
<li>Community health worker programs targeting reentry populations</li>
</ul>
<p>RHTP funding could support <strong>rural jail health capacity building</strong> that current criminal justice funding streams cannot provide. It could fund <strong>reentry specialists</strong> positioned in rural communities receiving returning citizens. It could support <strong>telehealth infrastructure</strong> enabling behavioral health access where in-person providers do not exist.</p>
<h3 id="what-rhtp-cannot-provide">What RHTP Cannot Provide<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-rhtp-cannot-provide">#</a></h3>
<p>Fundamental barriers lie beyond RHTP&rsquo;s scope:</p>
<p><strong>What RHTP Cannot Provide:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Political priority for stigmatized population</li>
<li>Resolution of criminal justice system issues</li>
<li>Immediate community infrastructure where none exists</li>
<li>Housing stability and employment opportunity</li>
<li>Social support networks</li>
<li>Change in public attitudes toward formerly incarcerated</li>
</ul>
<p>RHTP can improve healthcare systems; it cannot address the social determinants that produce both incarceration and poor health outcomes. A person released to a rural community without housing, employment, transportation, or social support faces barriers that healthcare transformation alone cannot overcome.</p>
<h3 id="honest-assessment">Honest Assessment<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#honest-assessment">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>RHTP is unlikely to prioritize justice-involved populations regardless of need</strong> because political systems do not reward serving people who are politically invisible and socially stigmatized. States will fund popular interventions serving sympathetic populations. Justice-involved individuals are neither popular nor sympathetic in public perception.</p>
<p>For RHTP to serve justice-involved populations, <strong>specific design choices are required:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Explicit identification</strong> of justice-involved individuals as a target population</li>
<li><strong>Collaboration requirements</strong> between health agencies and corrections departments</li>
<li><strong>Pre-release service authorization</strong> enabling healthcare before release</li>
<li><strong>Medicaid enrollment integration</strong> with release planning processes</li>
<li><strong>Behavioral health prioritization</strong> recognizing high mental health and SUD needs</li>
<li><strong>Rural jail inclusion</strong> despite capacity limitations</li>
</ol>
<p>Without these design choices, RHTP will transform rural health for populations whose needs are visible while leaving invisible populations behind.</p>

<p>The intersection of <strong>justice involvement and substance use disorder</strong> creates the highest immediate risk. Post-release overdose mortality reflects this intersection: people with SUD, tolerance reduced during incarceration, released without MAT continuation, returning to environments where substances are available. This intersection kills people in the weeks following release.</p>
<p>The intersection of <strong>justice involvement and serious mental illness</strong> produces cycling through jails, emergency departments, and streets. People with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and severe depression experience incarceration at rates vastly exceeding their population proportion. Rural communities lack psychiatric services that could divert from incarceration or treat upon release.</p>

<li>Medicaid enrollment completed before release</li>
<li>Medication supply exceeding 30 days at release</li>

<p>RHTP cannot resolve fundamental contradictions in American approaches to incarceration and health:</p>
<p><strong>What Transformation Cannot Provide:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Resolution of mass incarceration</li>
<li>Adequate carceral healthcare funding</li>
<li>Political support for stigmatized populations</li>
<li>Housing and employment that stabilize health</li>
<li>Change in public attitudes toward punishment</li>
<li>Immediate workforce where none exists</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>Justice-involved populations experience healthcare discontinuities that transform high-need individuals into crisis events. The transition from incarceration to community creates gaps that existing systems are not designed to bridge. Medicaid coverage lapses. Medications run out. Behavioral health needs go unmet. Overdose claims lives in the weeks that policy neglects.</p>
<p>RHTP could address some of these gaps. Pre-release care coordination, Medicaid enrollment assistance, MAT expansion, and reentry navigation are all within RHTP&rsquo;s potential scope. States could designate justice-involved populations as priority groups. Rural jails could receive capacity building. Community health workers could support reentry transitions.</p>
<p>They probably will not. Political systems do not reward serving invisible, stigmatized populations. States will pursue interventions that generate political support, and supporting people emerging from incarceration generates opposition, not support. The mathematical need is clear; the political will is absent.</p>
<p>The residents emerging from rural jails and returning to rural communities deserve healthcare continuity. They also deserve acknowledgment that their current treatment reflects not their healthcare needs but political judgments about whose suffering matters. Some populations are visible; systems respond. Others are invisible; gaps persist. Justice-involved individuals transition from one system that barely provides care to communities that cannot provide care at all.</p>
<p>Until political systems value all rural residents, transformation will remain incomplete.</p>
