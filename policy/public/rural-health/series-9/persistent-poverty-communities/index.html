  "articleBody": "Persistent poverty counties are places where 20 percent or more of residents have lived in poverty across four consecutive measurement periods spanning 30 years. The USDA Economic Research Service currently identifies approximately 353 such counties in the United States. Eighty-five percent of them are rural. They concentrate in identifiable regions: the Mississippi Delta stretching through Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi; the Black Belt of Alabama and Georgia; Appalachian Kentucky and West Virginia; the Texas-Mexico border; and tribal areas across the Southwest and Great Plains.\nThis article examines a fundamental tension that shapes all discussion of healthcare transformation in these communities: current generation versus intergenerational change. The RHTP operates on a five-year timeline ending in 2030. Persistent poverty counties have experienced structural disadvantage for generations. Can a healthcare intervention with a fixed endpoint address health problems rooted in economic conditions transmitted across 30, 50, or even 100 years?\nThe analytical value of this article lies not in cataloging the health burdens of persistent poverty, which are well documented, but in assessing whether healthcare transformation can make meaningful difference in communities where health outcomes reflect living conditions that healthcare cannot change. If income, housing, food security, and employment explain more health variation than healthcare access, what should transformation accomplish? What honest assessment should guide expectations?\nWithin persistent poverty communities lies significant diversity. The Mississippi Delta differs from Appalachian coal country. Border colonias differ from Pine Ridge Reservation. Some persistent poverty counties retain strong social networks and community institutions. Others have experienced erosion of the social fabric that compounds material deprivation. This article acknowledges that diversity while examining common patterns that federal classification captures.\nPopulation Profile Definition and Identification The USDA Economic Research Service defines persistent poverty counties as those with poverty rates of 20 percent or higher in the 1990 and 2000 decennial censuses and in the 2007-11 and 2017-21 five-year American Community Survey estimates. The threshold captures counties where poverty is not cyclical or temporary but structural. The 2025 County Typology Codes update identifies 353 counties meeting this definition.\nThe federal definition serves specific purposes: targeting resources, measuring policy impact, and identifying areas requiring sustained attention. It does not capture all dimensions of poverty. Census tract analysis reveals persistent poverty tracts within non-persistent-poverty counties, identifying concentrated disadvantage that county-level data masks. Approximately 8,300 census tracts meet persistent poverty criteria, and 75 percent of them are located outside persistent poverty counties.\nGeographic Distribution Persistent poverty concentrates regionally. Nearly 84 percent of persistent poverty counties are in the South, comprising more than 20 percent of all counties in the region. The remaining counties cluster in tribal areas of the Great Plains and Southwest, border regions of Texas, and isolated pockets elsewhere.\nRegion Persistent Poverty Counties Share of Regional Counties Mississippi Delta 72 68% Appalachia (central) 54 31% Black Belt 41 52% Texas Border 24 43% Great Plains (tribal) 28 12% Other 134 \u003c5% The geographic concentration matters for RHTP implementation. States with many persistent poverty counties include Mississippi (49), Kentucky (38), Louisiana (21), Georgia (26), and Texas (43). These states receive RHTP funding, but whether funding formulas adequately weight persistent poverty status varies.\nDemographic Characteristics Persistent poverty counties are demographically distinct from rural America generally. They have higher proportions of Black residents (Delta, Black Belt), higher proportions of Hispanic residents (border region), and higher proportions of American Indian/Alaska Native residents (Great Plains, Southwest). The persistent poverty classification cuts across racial and ethnic categories, but its regional concentration means specific populations bear disproportionate burden.\nEducational attainment in persistent poverty counties trails national averages significantly. Approximately 57 percent of working-age adults lack any post-secondary education, compared to 42 percent nationally. Low educational attainment constrains employment options, perpetuates low wages, and limits health literacy.\nEmployment patterns in persistent poverty counties reflect limited opportunity. Less than 63 percent of prime working-age adults (25-54) are employed in many of these counties, compared to 79 percent nationally. The jobs that exist tend toward low-wage service, agriculture, or government employment. Manufacturing has largely departed. Resource extraction (coal, timber) has declined.\nHistorical Context Persistent poverty is not accidental. It reflects historical patterns of wealth extraction, structural discrimination, and policy choices that created conditions transmitted across generations. The Delta’s poverty traces to plantation agriculture that extracted wealth while impoverishing workers. Appalachia’s poverty traces to extractive industries that took coal and timber while leaving environmental degradation and occupational disease. Border region poverty reflects historical exclusion and limited infrastructure investment.\nUnderstanding this history matters for assessing what healthcare transformation can accomplish. Health outcomes in persistent poverty communities reflect not individual choices or even current conditions but accumulated disadvantage over decades or centuries. Expecting healthcare investment to overcome this accumulated disadvantage overestimates what healthcare can do.\nHealth Status and Access Health Outcomes Health outcomes in persistent poverty counties are among the worst in the nation. The disparities are stark and consistent across measures.\nMeasure Persistent Poverty Counties General Rural Gap Data Source Life expectancy 72-75 years 77 years 2-5 years IHME County Data All-cause mortality (per 100,000) 1,100-1,400 830 +270-570 CDC WONDER Infant mortality (per 1,000) 9-12 6 +3-6 NVSS Diabetes prevalence 14-18% 11% +3-7% BRFSS Heart disease mortality 250-320/100K 170 +80-150 CDC WONDER Obesity prevalence 38-45% 34% +4-11% BRFSS Child poverty rate 35-70% 22% +13-48% ACS Adults reporting fair/poor health 28-35% 18% +10-17% BRFSS Mental health distress 19-24% 14% +5-10% BRFSS The worst counties show even more severe outcomes. Claiborne County, Mississippi has a child poverty rate of 72 percent. East Carroll Parish, Louisiana, approaches 66 percent. Some South Dakota counties with majority American Indian populations exceed 60 percent. These are not statistical anomalies but consistent patterns across persistent poverty regions.\nAccess Barriers Healthcare access in persistent poverty counties faces multiple compounding barriers.\nProvider shortage is severe. Persistent poverty counties average 40 primary care physicians per 100,000 residents, compared to 90 in metropolitan areas. Specialist presence is essentially nonexistent. Many persistent poverty counties have no psychiatrist, no cardiologist, no oncologist. The workforce crisis compounds as existing providers age without replacement.\nHospital presence is precarious. Of the 28 hospitals that closed in Mississippi between 2010 and 2025, most were in persistent poverty counties. Rural hospital closure risk analysis identifies 49 percent of Mississippi’s remaining rural hospitals as at risk of closure. Similar patterns appear across the Delta and Black Belt.\nInsurance coverage gaps persist. Persistent poverty counties are disproportionately located in states that have not expanded Medicaid. Mississippi, Texas, Georgia, and other states with high persistent poverty concentrations left millions in the coverage gap where residents earn too much for traditional Medicaid but too little for marketplace subsidies.\nTransportation barriers are acute. Many persistent poverty counties lack public transportation entirely. Personal vehicle ownership rates are lower than national averages. The distance to healthcare combined with transportation barriers creates access problems that insurance coverage alone cannot solve.\nUtilization Patterns Healthcare utilization in persistent poverty counties reflects barriers, not preference. Emergency department use is higher, reflecting delayed care and lack of primary care alternatives. Preventive care utilization is lower, reflecting barriers to access and competing demands from economic survival. Chronic disease management is worse, reflecting fragmented care and inability to follow treatment regimens that assume stable housing, reliable transportation, and food security.\nThe Core Tension: Current Generation vs. Intergenerational Change The Current Generation Focus RHTP operates through 2030. From this perspective, transformation should address current healthcare needs with available resources. Building clinics, deploying telehealth, training community health workers, and expanding access can improve health outcomes for people living in persistent poverty counties today. Perfect is the enemy of good. Waiting for structural change that may never come means abandoning current residents.\nThis view has merit. People in persistent poverty counties need healthcare now. Children born this year will benefit from maternal care improvements. Elders aging in place need geriatric services. Diabetes patients need management programs. Current investments yield current benefits. The RHTP timeline demands current-focused implementation.\nThe Intergenerational Necessity Poverty transmitted across 30+ years cannot be addressed by five-year programs. Children growing up in persistent poverty counties inherit disadvantage regardless of healthcare access. Educational opportunity remains limited. Employment options remain constrained. Housing remains substandard. Food security remains uncertain. Healthcare addresses downstream consequences while upstream causes persist.\nFrom this perspective, healthcare transformation without economic transformation produces temporary improvement rather than lasting change. When RHTP funding ends in 2030, what sustains the clinics, the workforce, the programs? Persistent poverty counties lack the tax base, the population growth, and the economic activity to support healthcare infrastructure without external subsidy. The pattern repeats: federal investment, modest improvement, funding withdrawal, return to baseline.\nWhat Evidence Suggests Social determinants research consistently demonstrates that income, education, and living conditions explain more health variation than healthcare access. The relationship is causal, not merely correlational. Improving income improves health. Improving education improves health. Improving housing improves health. Healthcare can mitigate consequences of poverty but cannot overcome poverty’s causes.\nThis does not mean healthcare transformation is useless. It means transformation must be honest about what it can achieve. Healthcare in persistent poverty counties can reduce preventable deaths, manage chronic conditions, support maternal and child health, and address mental health needs. It cannot eliminate the health gap between persistent poverty counties and prosperous communities because that gap reflects conditions healthcare does not control.\nRHTP Relevance How RHTP Addresses Persistent Poverty Communities RHTP funding flows to states, which allocate to regions and programs. Persistent poverty counties do not automatically receive enhanced funding. Whether transformation reaches these communities depends on state priorities, allocation formulas, and implementation capacity.\nState Persistent Poverty Counties RHTP Approach Assessment Mississippi 49 Regional networks, CHW deployment Mixed: high need, limited per-capita funding Kentucky 38 Appalachian focus, workforce emphasis Moderate: Medicaid expansion helps Georgia 26 Statewide distribution, partial Medicaid Limited: non-expansion undermines access Texas 43 Regional variation, scale challenges Weak: massive scale penalty, non-expansion Louisiana 21 Medicaid expansion, Delta focus Better: expansion provides coverage base Alabama 17 State-controlled distribution Uncertain: opacity limits assessment Gap Assessment What RHTP provides:\nInfrastructure investment in underserved areas Workforce development and loan repayment Telehealth expansion and digital infrastructure Community health worker deployment Care coordination and chronic disease management What RHTP fails to provide:\nMedicaid expansion requirement (states can remain non-expansion) Persistent poverty weighting in allocation formula Economic development integration Housing, food security, or transportation solutions Sustainability mechanisms beyond 2030 Adequacy assessment: The universal RHTP approach treats persistent poverty counties as a subset of rural America rather than a distinct category requiring distinct intervention. The formula does not adequately weight the severity of persistent poverty. States with many persistent poverty counties receive per-capita funding that does not match need intensity.\nVignette: The Carter Family of Bolivar County\nFour generations in the Mississippi Delta\nJames Carter’s great-grandfather worked the cotton fields as a sharecropper in the 1930s, his family never escaping debt to the landowner. His grandfather moved to the catfish processing plant when agriculture mechanized, earning minimum wage until the plant closed in 1998. His father worked construction when work was available, developed hypertension at 35, had a stroke at 48, and died at 52 without ever seeing a cardiologist. James, now 34, works gig delivery when his car runs, has diabetes diagnosed at 29, and has not seen a doctor in two years because the nearest one accepting Medicaid is 45 miles away and his car barely makes it.\nHis son, born last year, arrived premature at 34 weeks after his girlfriend’s preeclampsia went undetected because she missed prenatal appointments. The nearest OB had a three-month wait. She drove herself to the hospital in labor because the ambulance takes 40 minutes from the north end of the county.\nA new RHTP-funded health center will open in Cleveland, 18 miles away, next year. It will offer primary care, chronic disease management, and prenatal services. James plans to establish care there. But the center will not give him a better job, will not repair his car, will not fix the mold in his rental housing, and will not put more food in the kitchen when his diabetes needs dietary management. The center represents real progress. It also represents the limits of healthcare transformation in places where health outcomes reflect conditions healthcare cannot change.\nWhat would transform the Carters’ health trajectory? Not healthcare alone. A job paying living wage. Housing without mold exposure. Reliable transportation. Food access beyond dollar stores. These are not healthcare responsibilities, but without them, healthcare treats symptoms while causes persist.\nAlternative Perspective: The Medical Model Limitation The Perspective Healthcare transformation operates within the medical model: identify health problems, provide healthcare services, improve health outcomes. The medical model assumes that healthcare intervention is the appropriate response to health problems. For persistent poverty communities, this assumption requires examination.\nThe Strongest Version Social determinants research demonstrates conclusively that health is produced primarily outside healthcare settings. Income predicts health better than healthcare access. Education predicts health better than healthcare access. Neighborhood conditions predict health better than healthcare access. Healthcare addresses perhaps 10-20 percent of health variation; the remainder reflects social, economic, and environmental factors.\nExpecting healthcare transformation to overcome persistent poverty’s health effects is like expecting emergency rooms to solve car crashes while ignoring road design, vehicle safety, and drunk driving policy. Emergency rooms treat crash victims. They do not prevent crashes. Healthcare treats poverty’s health consequences. It does not prevent poverty.\nFrom this perspective, persistent poverty county health outcomes will not substantially improve until persistent poverty ends. Healthcare transformation is necessary but insufficient. Investing heavily in healthcare while neglecting economic development, educational opportunity, housing quality, and food access produces limited returns because healthcare addresses the wrong level of causation.\nAssessment This perspective has substantial support from evidence. The communities with the best health outcomes are not those with the most healthcare but those with the most economic opportunity, educational attainment, and social stability. Persistent poverty counties could double their physician supply and would still have health outcomes reflecting economic conditions.\nHowever, the perspective can be taken too far. Healthcare does matter for some outcomes. Maternal mortality responds to obstetric care access. Diabetes complications respond to management programs. Vaccine-preventable diseases respond to vaccination. Acute care needs respond to emergency services. Healthcare transformation cannot solve persistent poverty, but it can reduce preventable suffering within persistent poverty.\nThe honest conclusion: healthcare transformation is necessary but will not be sufficient. Persistent poverty county health outcomes will improve modestly with RHTP investment. They will not approach national averages until persistent poverty itself is addressed. Transformation advocates should be honest about this limitation rather than promising health equity that healthcare alone cannot deliver.\nState and Regional Variation Why Persistent Poverty Experience Varies Factor Effect on Health Outcomes Examples Medicaid expansion Coverage determines access to care Louisiana expanded (better), Mississippi did not (worse) State investment State supplements federal funding Kentucky invests more than Alabama Regional institutions Some regions have anchor institutions Delta has Delta Health Alliance; other areas lack equivalent Historical discrimination Racism compounds poverty Black Belt outcomes worse than Appalachian at similar income Community cohesion Social networks buffer deprivation Some communities maintain support systems; others eroded Economic trajectory Declining versus stable matters Coal counties declining; agricultural counties more stable Regional Variation Examples Mississippi Delta: The highest concentration of persistent poverty counties in the nation. Majority Black population. No Medicaid expansion. Worst maternal and infant mortality. Fewest providers per capita. RHTP funding approximately $129 per rural resident annually cannot offset accumulated disinvestment.\nAppalachian Kentucky: High persistent poverty concentration. Majority white population. Medicaid expansion since 2014. Opioid crisis epicenter. Better coverage but still severe outcomes because expansion addresses insurance, not social determinants.\nTexas Border: High persistent poverty in colonias lacking basic infrastructure. Majority Hispanic population. No Medicaid expansion. Distance to care plus documentation fear limits access. RHTP funding diluted by Texas scale penalty ($65 per rural resident).\nVignette: Two Counties, Two Contexts\nMcCreary County, Kentucky and Holmes County, Mississippi\nBoth counties meet persistent poverty criteria. Both have poverty rates exceeding 25 percent. Both face provider shortages and hospital closure risk. But their contexts differ in ways that shape health outcomes.\nMcCreary County benefits from Kentucky’s 2014 Medicaid expansion. Eighty percent of eligible residents gained coverage. The county’s hospital remains open, stabilized by Medicaid revenue. A new RHTP-funded community health worker program connects residents to care. Life expectancy has modestly improved since 2015. The opioid crisis remains severe, but medication-assisted treatment is now available locally.\nHolmes County has no Medicaid expansion. An estimated 18 percent of adults are uninsured in the coverage gap. The nearest hospital is 30 miles away after the county hospital converted to emergency-only. No community health worker program exists because the state did not prioritize CHW deployment. Life expectancy has declined since 2015. Maternal mortality rates exceed 40 per 100,000, triple the national average.\nSame federal classification. Same poverty rates. Different state policy choices. Different outcomes.\nIntersectionality Considerations Compound Disadvantage People in persistent poverty counties often belong to multiple disadvantaged categories simultaneously.\nIntersecting Population Compound Effect Estimated Size Elderly in persistent poverty Fixed income + poverty infrastructure ~1.2 million Tribal members in persistent poverty IHS underfunding + poverty context ~400,000 Black residents in Delta/Black Belt Racism + poverty + non-expansion ~2.1 million Children in persistent poverty Developmental impacts + limited opportunity ~1.8 million Disabled in persistent poverty Access barriers + income limitations ~800,000 Single-population analysis misses how these intersections compound disadvantage. An elderly Black woman in a non-expansion Delta persistent poverty county experiences multiple barriers simultaneously: Medicare gaps, no Medicaid expansion, racism in healthcare, distance to care, transportation barriers, and caregiver shortage. Her health trajectory reflects all these factors interacting, not any single one.\nImplications for Transformation What Transformation Must Provide Within persistent poverty context:\nPrimary care access with sliding scale or Medicaid acceptance Chronic disease management adapted to resource constraints Maternal and child health services reaching underserved communities Mental health and substance use treatment Community health worker deployment for navigation and social support Telehealth infrastructure where broadband permits Structural recognition:\nSDOH screening and referral (knowing resources are limited) Food insecurity intervention where possible Transportation assistance programs Housing condition linkages to health What Transformation Cannot Provide Economic development: Healthcare cannot create jobs, raise wages, or attract industry Educational opportunity: Healthcare cannot improve schools or expand college access Housing improvement: Healthcare cannot repair homes, address lead paint, or fix mold Intergenerational mobility: Healthcare cannot break poverty cycles transmitted across generations Tax base restoration: Healthcare cannot fund local services when population and economy decline Honest Expectations RHTP investment in persistent poverty counties will produce modest health improvements for current residents. It will not eliminate health disparities rooted in economic conditions. When funding ends in 2030, sustainability depends on factors healthcare cannot control: will Medicaid expansion occur? Will economic conditions improve? Will population stabilize?\nStates should target persistent poverty counties explicitly rather than distributing funding uniformly. But states should also communicate realistic expectations. Healthcare transformation addresses healthcare access. It does not transform persistent poverty.\nAssessment and Recommendations For RHTP Implementation Target explicitly: States should identify persistent poverty counties and ensure proportional or enhanced resource allocation. Universal distribution disadvantages highest-need communities.\nDeploy community health workers: CHW models work particularly well in persistent poverty contexts where trust in formal healthcare is limited and navigation complexity is high.\nIntegrate SDOH: Screen for social needs and connect to available resources, while being honest that resources are limited.\nPlan for sustainability: Identify what can continue after 2030 and what cannot. Build toward sustainable models rather than temporary programs.\nFor Federal Policy Weight formulas for persistent poverty: Current RHTP allocation does not adequately weight persistent poverty status. Formula revision could direct more resources to highest-need counties.\nLink to economic development: Connect RHTP to USDA rural development, ARC Appalachian investment, and DRA Delta programs. Healthcare transformation alone is insufficient.\nRequire Medicaid expansion: Coverage is foundational. Non-expansion states cannot achieve transformation when millions lack insurance.\nFor Communities Engage transformation planning: Persistent poverty communities have knowledge of local conditions that outside planners lack. Community voice should shape implementation.\nMaintain realistic expectations: Healthcare improvement matters but will not solve problems rooted in economic conditions. Advocacy should extend beyond healthcare to economic development, education, and housing.\nBuild on existing strengths: Many persistent poverty communities retain social networks, faith institutions, and mutual aid traditions. Transformation should strengthen rather than replace these assets.\nConclusion Persistent poverty counties represent the hardest test of rural health transformation. Health outcomes in these communities reflect not healthcare access but accumulated disadvantage across generations. The RHTP can improve healthcare access, deploy community health workers, expand telehealth, and strengthen infrastructure. It cannot eliminate health disparities rooted in economic conditions healthcare does not control.\nThe evidence supports a necessary but insufficient assessment. Healthcare transformation is necessary because people in persistent poverty counties deserve healthcare access. It is insufficient because healthcare addresses perhaps 20 percent of what determines health while poverty conditions determine the rest.\nHonest acknowledgment of these limits is not defeatism. It is the foundation for appropriate expectations and sustainable investment. Healthcare transformation in persistent poverty counties should aim for meaningful improvement in access, chronic disease management, maternal health, and preventable mortality. It should not promise health equity that requires economic transformation beyond healthcare scope.\nThe 353 persistent poverty counties and their 5+ million residents deserve federal attention, state investment, and transformation resources. They also deserve honesty about what transformation can and cannot achieve. Healthcare matters.

<p>Persistent poverty counties are places where <strong>20 percent or more of residents have lived in poverty across four consecutive measurement periods spanning 30 years</strong>. The USDA Economic Research Service currently identifies approximately <strong>353 such counties</strong> in the United States. Eighty-five percent of them are rural. They concentrate in identifiable regions: the Mississippi Delta stretching through Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi; the Black Belt of Alabama and Georgia; Appalachian Kentucky and West Virginia; the Texas-Mexico border; and tribal areas across the Southwest and Great Plains.</p>
<p>This article examines a fundamental tension that shapes all discussion of healthcare transformation in these communities: <strong>current generation versus intergenerational change</strong>. The RHTP operates on a five-year timeline ending in 2030. Persistent poverty counties have experienced structural disadvantage for generations. Can a healthcare intervention with a fixed endpoint address health problems rooted in economic conditions transmitted across 30, 50, or even 100 years?</p>
<p>The analytical value of this article lies not in cataloging the health burdens of persistent poverty, which are well documented, but in assessing whether healthcare transformation can make meaningful difference in communities where health outcomes reflect living conditions that healthcare cannot change. If income, housing, food security, and employment explain more health variation than healthcare access, what should transformation accomplish? What honest assessment should guide expectations?</p>
<p>Within persistent poverty communities lies significant diversity. The Mississippi Delta differs from Appalachian coal country. Border colonias differ from Pine Ridge Reservation. Some persistent poverty counties retain strong social networks and community institutions. Others have experienced erosion of the social fabric that compounds material deprivation. This article acknowledges that diversity while examining common patterns that federal classification captures.</p>

<h3 id="definition-and-identification">Definition and Identification<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#definition-and-identification">#</a></h3>
<p>The USDA Economic Research Service defines <strong>persistent poverty counties</strong> as those with poverty rates of 20 percent or higher in the 1990 and 2000 decennial censuses and in the 2007-11 and 2017-21 five-year American Community Survey estimates. The threshold captures counties where poverty is not cyclical or temporary but structural. The 2025 County Typology Codes update identifies <strong>353 counties</strong> meeting this definition.</p>
<p>The federal definition serves specific purposes: targeting resources, measuring policy impact, and identifying areas requiring sustained attention. It does not capture all dimensions of poverty. Census tract analysis reveals <strong>persistent poverty tracts within non-persistent-poverty counties</strong>, identifying concentrated disadvantage that county-level data masks. Approximately 8,300 census tracts meet persistent poverty criteria, and 75 percent of them are located outside persistent poverty counties.</p>
<h3 id="geographic-distribution">Geographic Distribution<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#geographic-distribution">#</a></h3>
<p>Persistent poverty concentrates regionally. Nearly <strong>84 percent of persistent poverty counties are in the South</strong>, comprising more than 20 percent of all counties in the region. The remaining counties cluster in tribal areas of the Great Plains and Southwest, border regions of Texas, and isolated pockets elsewhere.</p>

<p>The geographic concentration matters for RHTP implementation. States with many persistent poverty counties include Mississippi (49), Kentucky (38), Louisiana (21), Georgia (26), and Texas (43). These states receive RHTP funding, but whether funding formulas adequately weight persistent poverty status varies.</p>
<h3 id="demographic-characteristics">Demographic Characteristics<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#demographic-characteristics">#</a></h3>
<p>Persistent poverty counties are demographically distinct from rural America generally. They have <strong>higher proportions of Black residents</strong> (Delta, Black Belt), <strong>higher proportions of Hispanic residents</strong> (border region), and <strong>higher proportions of American Indian/Alaska Native residents</strong> (Great Plains, Southwest). The persistent poverty classification cuts across racial and ethnic categories, but its regional concentration means specific populations bear disproportionate burden.</p>
<p>Educational attainment in persistent poverty counties trails national averages significantly. Approximately <strong>57 percent of working-age adults lack any post-secondary education</strong>, compared to 42 percent nationally. Low educational attainment constrains employment options, perpetuates low wages, and limits health literacy.</p>
<p>Employment patterns in persistent poverty counties reflect limited opportunity. <strong>Less than 63 percent of prime working-age adults (25-54) are employed</strong> in many of these counties, compared to 79 percent nationally. The jobs that exist tend toward low-wage service, agriculture, or government employment. Manufacturing has largely departed. Resource extraction (coal, timber) has declined.</p>
<h3 id="historical-context">Historical Context<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#historical-context">#</a></h3>
<p>Persistent poverty is not accidental. It reflects <strong>historical patterns of wealth extraction, structural discrimination, and policy choices</strong> that created conditions transmitted across generations. The Delta&rsquo;s poverty traces to plantation agriculture that extracted wealth while impoverishing workers. Appalachia&rsquo;s poverty traces to extractive industries that took coal and timber while leaving environmental degradation and occupational disease. Border region poverty reflects historical exclusion and limited infrastructure investment.</p>
<p>Understanding this history matters for assessing what healthcare transformation can accomplish. Health outcomes in persistent poverty communities reflect not individual choices or even current conditions but accumulated disadvantage over decades or centuries. Expecting healthcare investment to overcome this accumulated disadvantage overestimates what healthcare can do.</p>

<p>The worst counties show even more severe outcomes. <strong>Claiborne County, Mississippi has a child poverty rate of 72 percent.</strong> East Carroll Parish, Louisiana, approaches 66 percent. Some South Dakota counties with majority American Indian populations exceed 60 percent. These are not statistical anomalies but consistent patterns across persistent poverty regions.</p>
<h3 id="access-barriers">Access Barriers<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#access-barriers">#</a></h3>
<p>Healthcare access in persistent poverty counties faces multiple compounding barriers.</p>
<p><strong>Provider shortage</strong> is severe. Persistent poverty counties average <strong>40 primary care physicians per 100,000 residents</strong>, compared to 90 in metropolitan areas. Specialist presence is essentially nonexistent. Many persistent poverty counties have <strong>no psychiatrist, no cardiologist, no oncologist</strong>. The workforce crisis compounds as existing providers age without replacement.</p>
<p><strong>Hospital presence</strong> is precarious. Of the 28 hospitals that closed in Mississippi between 2010 and 2025, most were in persistent poverty counties. Rural hospital closure risk analysis identifies <strong>49 percent of Mississippi&rsquo;s remaining rural hospitals as at risk of closure</strong>. Similar patterns appear across the Delta and Black Belt.</p>
<p><strong>Insurance coverage</strong> gaps persist. Persistent poverty counties are disproportionately located in states that have not expanded Medicaid. Mississippi, Texas, Georgia, and other states with high persistent poverty concentrations left millions in the <strong>coverage gap</strong> where residents earn too much for traditional Medicaid but too little for marketplace subsidies.</p>
<p><strong>Transportation</strong> barriers are acute. Many persistent poverty counties lack public transportation entirely. Personal vehicle ownership rates are lower than national averages. The distance to healthcare combined with transportation barriers creates access problems that insurance coverage alone cannot solve.</p>
<h3 id="utilization-patterns">Utilization Patterns<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#utilization-patterns">#</a></h3>
<p>Healthcare utilization in persistent poverty counties reflects barriers, not preference. <strong>Emergency department use is higher</strong>, reflecting delayed care and lack of primary care alternatives. <strong>Preventive care utilization is lower</strong>, reflecting barriers to access and competing demands from economic survival. <strong>Chronic disease management is worse</strong>, reflecting fragmented care and inability to follow treatment regimens that assume stable housing, reliable transportation, and food security.</p>

<p>RHTP operates through 2030. From this perspective, transformation should address current healthcare needs with available resources. Building clinics, deploying telehealth, training community health workers, and expanding access can improve health outcomes for people living in persistent poverty counties today. Perfect is the enemy of good. Waiting for structural change that may never come means abandoning current residents.</p>
<p>This view has merit. People in persistent poverty counties need healthcare now. Children born this year will benefit from maternal care improvements. Elders aging in place need geriatric services. Diabetes patients need management programs. Current investments yield current benefits. The RHTP timeline demands current-focused implementation.</p>
<h3 id="the-intergenerational-necessity">The Intergenerational Necessity<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-intergenerational-necessity">#</a></h3>
<p>Poverty transmitted across 30+ years cannot be addressed by five-year programs. Children growing up in persistent poverty counties inherit disadvantage regardless of healthcare access. Educational opportunity remains limited. Employment options remain constrained. Housing remains substandard. Food security remains uncertain. Healthcare addresses downstream consequences while upstream causes persist.</p>
<p>From this perspective, healthcare transformation without economic transformation produces <strong>temporary improvement</strong> rather than lasting change. When RHTP funding ends in 2030, what sustains the clinics, the workforce, the programs? Persistent poverty counties lack the tax base, the population growth, and the economic activity to support healthcare infrastructure without external subsidy. The pattern repeats: federal investment, modest improvement, funding withdrawal, return to baseline.</p>
<h3 id="what-evidence-suggests">What Evidence Suggests<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-evidence-suggests">#</a></h3>
<p>Social determinants research consistently demonstrates that <strong>income, education, and living conditions explain more health variation than healthcare access</strong>. The relationship is causal, not merely correlational. Improving income improves health. Improving education improves health. Improving housing improves health. Healthcare can mitigate consequences of poverty but cannot overcome poverty&rsquo;s causes.</p>
<p>This does not mean healthcare transformation is useless. It means transformation must be <strong>honest about what it can achieve</strong>. Healthcare in persistent poverty counties can reduce preventable deaths, manage chronic conditions, support maternal and child health, and address mental health needs. It cannot eliminate the health gap between persistent poverty counties and prosperous communities because that gap reflects conditions healthcare does not control.</p>

<p><strong>Adequacy assessment:</strong> The universal RHTP approach treats persistent poverty counties as a subset of rural America rather than a distinct category requiring distinct intervention. The formula does not adequately weight the severity of persistent poverty. States with many persistent poverty counties receive per-capita funding that does not match need intensity.</p>

<p><strong>Vignette: The Carter Family of Bolivar County</strong></p>
<p><em>Four generations in the Mississippi Delta</em></p>
<p>James Carter&rsquo;s great-grandfather worked the cotton fields as a sharecropper in the 1930s, his family never escaping debt to the landowner. His grandfather moved to the catfish processing plant when agriculture mechanized, earning minimum wage until the plant closed in 1998. His father worked construction when work was available, developed hypertension at 35, had a stroke at 48, and died at 52 without ever seeing a cardiologist. James, now 34, works gig delivery when his car runs, has diabetes diagnosed at 29, and has not seen a doctor in two years because the nearest one accepting Medicaid is 45 miles away and his car barely makes it.</p>
<p>His son, born last year, arrived premature at 34 weeks after his girlfriend&rsquo;s preeclampsia went undetected because she missed prenatal appointments. The nearest OB had a three-month wait. She drove herself to the hospital in labor because the ambulance takes 40 minutes from the north end of the county.</p>
<p>A new RHTP-funded health center will open in Cleveland, 18 miles away, next year. It will offer primary care, chronic disease management, and prenatal services. James plans to establish care there. But the center will not give him a better job, will not repair his car, will not fix the mold in his rental housing, and will not put more food in the kitchen when his diabetes needs dietary management. The center represents real progress. It also represents the limits of healthcare transformation in places where health outcomes reflect conditions healthcare cannot change.</p>
<p>What would transform the Carters&rsquo; health trajectory? Not healthcare alone. A job paying living wage. Housing without mold exposure. Reliable transportation. Food access beyond dollar stores. These are not healthcare responsibilities, but without them, healthcare treats symptoms while causes persist.</p>

<h3 id="the-perspective">The Perspective<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-perspective">#</a></h3>
<p>Healthcare transformation operates within the <strong>medical model</strong>: identify health problems, provide healthcare services, improve health outcomes. The medical model assumes that healthcare intervention is the appropriate response to health problems. For persistent poverty communities, this assumption requires examination.</p>
<h3 id="the-strongest-version">The Strongest Version<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-strongest-version">#</a></h3>
<p>Social determinants research demonstrates conclusively that <strong>health is produced primarily outside healthcare settings</strong>. Income predicts health better than healthcare access. Education predicts health better than healthcare access. Neighborhood conditions predict health better than healthcare access. Healthcare addresses perhaps <strong>10-20 percent of health variation</strong>; the remainder reflects social, economic, and environmental factors.</p>
<p>Expecting healthcare transformation to overcome persistent poverty&rsquo;s health effects is like expecting emergency rooms to solve car crashes while ignoring road design, vehicle safety, and drunk driving policy. Emergency rooms treat crash victims. They do not prevent crashes. Healthcare treats poverty&rsquo;s health consequences. It does not prevent poverty.</p>
<p>From this perspective, persistent poverty county health outcomes will not substantially improve until persistent poverty ends. Healthcare transformation is <strong>necessary but insufficient</strong>. Investing heavily in healthcare while neglecting economic development, educational opportunity, housing quality, and food access produces limited returns because healthcare addresses the wrong level of causation.</p>
<h3 id="assessment">Assessment<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#assessment">#</a></h3>
<p>This perspective has <strong>substantial support</strong> from evidence. The communities with the best health outcomes are not those with the most healthcare but those with the most economic opportunity, educational attainment, and social stability. Persistent poverty counties could double their physician supply and would still have health outcomes reflecting economic conditions.</p>
<p>However, the perspective can be taken too far. Healthcare does matter for some outcomes. Maternal mortality responds to obstetric care access. Diabetes complications respond to management programs. Vaccine-preventable diseases respond to vaccination. Acute care needs respond to emergency services. Healthcare transformation cannot solve persistent poverty, but it can reduce preventable suffering within persistent poverty.</p>
<p>The honest conclusion: <strong>healthcare transformation is necessary but will not be sufficient</strong>. Persistent poverty county health outcomes will improve modestly with RHTP investment. They will not approach national averages until persistent poverty itself is addressed. Transformation advocates should be honest about this limitation rather than promising health equity that healthcare alone cannot deliver.</p>

<p><strong>Mississippi Delta:</strong> The highest concentration of persistent poverty counties in the nation. Majority Black population. No Medicaid expansion. Worst maternal and infant mortality. Fewest providers per capita. RHTP funding approximately $129 per rural resident annually cannot offset accumulated disinvestment.</p>
<p><strong>Appalachian Kentucky:</strong> High persistent poverty concentration. Majority white population. Medicaid expansion since 2014. Opioid crisis epicenter. Better coverage but still severe outcomes because expansion addresses insurance, not social determinants.</p>
<p><strong>Texas Border:</strong> High persistent poverty in colonias lacking basic infrastructure. Majority Hispanic population. No Medicaid expansion. Distance to care plus documentation fear limits access. RHTP funding diluted by Texas scale penalty ($65 per rural resident).</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Vignette: Two Counties, Two Contexts</strong></p>
<p><em>McCreary County, Kentucky and Holmes County, Mississippi</em></p>
<p>Both counties meet persistent poverty criteria. Both have poverty rates exceeding 25 percent. Both face provider shortages and hospital closure risk. But their contexts differ in ways that shape health outcomes.</p>
<p>McCreary County benefits from Kentucky&rsquo;s 2014 Medicaid expansion. Eighty percent of eligible residents gained coverage. The county&rsquo;s hospital remains open, stabilized by Medicaid revenue. A new RHTP-funded community health worker program connects residents to care. Life expectancy has modestly improved since 2015. The opioid crisis remains severe, but medication-assisted treatment is now available locally.</p>
<p>Holmes County has no Medicaid expansion. An estimated 18 percent of adults are uninsured in the coverage gap. The nearest hospital is 30 miles away after the county hospital converted to emergency-only. No community health worker program exists because the state did not prioritize CHW deployment. Life expectancy has declined since 2015. Maternal mortality rates exceed 40 per 100,000, triple the national average.</p>
<p>Same federal classification. Same poverty rates. Different state policy choices. Different outcomes.</p>

<p>Single-population analysis misses how these intersections compound disadvantage. An elderly Black woman in a non-expansion Delta persistent poverty county experiences multiple barriers simultaneously: Medicare gaps, no Medicaid expansion, racism in healthcare, distance to care, transportation barriers, and caregiver shortage. Her health trajectory reflects all these factors interacting, not any single one.</p>

<li>Maternal and child health services reaching underserved communities</li>
<li>Mental health and substance use treatment</li>

<h3 id="what-transformation-cannot-provide">What Transformation Cannot Provide<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-transformation-cannot-provide">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Economic development:</strong> Healthcare cannot create jobs, raise wages, or attract industry</li>
<li><strong>Educational opportunity:</strong> Healthcare cannot improve schools or expand college access</li>
<li><strong>Housing improvement:</strong> Healthcare cannot repair homes, address lead paint, or fix mold</li>
<li><strong>Intergenerational mobility:</strong> Healthcare cannot break poverty cycles transmitted across generations</li>
<li><strong>Tax base restoration:</strong> Healthcare cannot fund local services when population and economy decline</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="honest-expectations">Honest Expectations<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#honest-expectations">#</a></h3>
<p>RHTP investment in persistent poverty counties will produce <strong>modest health improvements</strong> for current residents. It will not eliminate health disparities rooted in economic conditions. When funding ends in 2030, sustainability depends on factors healthcare cannot control: will Medicaid expansion occur? Will economic conditions improve? Will population stabilize?</p>
<p>States should target persistent poverty counties explicitly rather than distributing funding uniformly. But states should also communicate realistic expectations. Healthcare transformation addresses healthcare access. It does not transform persistent poverty.</p>
<h2 id="assessment-and-recommendations">Assessment and Recommendations<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#assessment-and-recommendations">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="for-rhtp-implementation">For RHTP Implementation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#for-rhtp-implementation">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Target explicitly:</strong> States should identify persistent poverty counties and ensure proportional or enhanced resource allocation. Universal distribution disadvantages highest-need communities.</p>
<p><strong>Deploy community health workers:</strong> CHW models work particularly well in persistent poverty contexts where trust in formal healthcare is limited and navigation complexity is high.</p>
<p><strong>Integrate SDOH:</strong> Screen for social needs and connect to available resources, while being honest that resources are limited.</p>
<p><strong>Plan for sustainability:</strong> Identify what can continue after 2030 and what cannot. Build toward sustainable models rather than temporary programs.</p>
<h3 id="for-federal-policy">For Federal Policy<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#for-federal-policy">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Weight formulas for persistent poverty:</strong> Current RHTP allocation does not adequately weight persistent poverty status. Formula revision could direct more resources to highest-need counties.</p>
<p><strong>Link to economic development:</strong> Connect RHTP to USDA rural development, ARC Appalachian investment, and DRA Delta programs. Healthcare transformation alone is insufficient.</p>
<p><strong>Require Medicaid expansion:</strong> Coverage is foundational. Non-expansion states cannot achieve transformation when millions lack insurance.</p>
<h3 id="for-communities">For Communities<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#for-communities">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Engage transformation planning:</strong> Persistent poverty communities have knowledge of local conditions that outside planners lack. Community voice should shape implementation.</p>
<p><strong>Maintain realistic expectations:</strong> Healthcare improvement matters but will not solve problems rooted in economic conditions. Advocacy should extend beyond healthcare to economic development, education, and housing.</p>
<p><strong>Build on existing strengths:</strong> Many persistent poverty communities retain social networks, faith institutions, and mutual aid traditions. Transformation should strengthen rather than replace these assets.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>Persistent poverty counties represent the hardest test of rural health transformation. Health outcomes in these communities reflect not healthcare access but accumulated disadvantage across generations. The RHTP can improve healthcare access, deploy community health workers, expand telehealth, and strengthen infrastructure. It cannot eliminate health disparities rooted in economic conditions healthcare does not control.</p>
<p>The evidence supports a <strong>necessary but insufficient</strong> assessment. Healthcare transformation is necessary because people in persistent poverty counties deserve healthcare access. It is insufficient because healthcare addresses perhaps 20 percent of what determines health while poverty conditions determine the rest.</p>
<p>Honest acknowledgment of these limits is not defeatism. It is the foundation for appropriate expectations and sustainable investment. Healthcare transformation in persistent poverty counties should aim for meaningful improvement in access, chronic disease management, maternal health, and preventable mortality. It should not promise health equity that requires economic transformation beyond healthcare scope.</p>
<p>The 353 persistent poverty counties and their 5+ million residents deserve federal attention, state investment, and transformation resources. They also deserve honesty about what transformation can and cannot achieve. Healthcare matters. It is not enough.</p>
