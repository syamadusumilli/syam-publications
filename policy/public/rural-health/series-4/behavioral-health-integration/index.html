  "articleBody": "Rural America faces a behavioral health crisis without the workforce to address it. Over 80 percent of rural counties carry mental health Health Professional Shortage Area designations. Many counties have no psychiatrists at all, with ratios exceeding 30,000 residents per provider in designated shortage areas. The 2024 National Survey on Drug Use and Health reported that approximately 7.2 million nonmetropolitan adults experienced mental illness, representing 22.9 percent of the rural adult population, yet services remain systematically unavailable.\nEvery RHTP application includes behavioral health investment. Every state acknowledges the crisis. Nearly every state proposes some combination of telehealth expansion, integration into primary care, crisis system development, and workforce recruitment. Yet the fundamental question persists: how do you deliver mental health treatment in communities where traditional psychiatric care cannot exist?\nThe answer emerging from research and implementation experience centers on workforce substitution and integration. Rather than importing psychiatrists who will not come, effective rural behavioral health strategies extend existing primary care capacity through collaborative care models, leverage technology through telebehavioral health, develop alternative workforces through peer support and community health workers, and build regional systems that concentrate scarce specialty expertise at hubs while supporting local delivery at spokes.\nThis article examines what the evidence actually shows about rural behavioral health interventions, identifies models with demonstrated effectiveness, and assesses whether RHTP investments align with proven approaches. The findings suggest that states emphasizing traditional workforce recruitment over integration and task-shifting will fail, while states building sustainable systems around collaborative care, telebehavioral health, and hub-and-spoke networks have pathways to meaningful improvement.\nThe Rural Context Behavioral health service delivery in rural America operates under constraints fundamentally different from urban settings. Understanding these constraints is essential for evaluating intervention evidence and assessing RHTP implementation prospects.\nPsychiatrist availability approaches zero in many rural areas. While the national psychiatrist to population ratio is approximately 16.8 per 100,000, rural counties average fewer than 5 per 100,000, and many frontier counties have none. HRSA data through 2025 document 3,862 mental health HPSAs in rural areas, requiring an estimated 1,682 additional practitioners to remove designations. Unlike primary care shortages that might be addressed through physician assistant and nurse practitioner expansion, psychiatrist shortages have no direct substitute under traditional care models.\nWorkforce projections offer no relief. HRSA’s behavioral health workforce brief projects substantial shortages through 2036 across psychiatrists, psychologists, counselors, and marriage and family therapists. Psychiatry residency training takes 12-13 years from undergraduate entry to independent practice. Even aggressive training expansion initiated now produces no meaningful rural supply increase within RHTP’s timeline. The pipeline solution does not exist for behavioral health within the program period.\nEmergency departments serve as the de facto crisis system. Without psychiatric beds, mobile crisis teams, or crisis stabilization units, rural hospitals absorb behavioral health emergencies they cannot appropriately treat. Patients presenting in psychiatric crisis may wait hours or days for transfer to distant facilities. Some rural emergency departments report behavioral health patients accounting for 10-20 percent of total visits, straining resources while delivering suboptimal care.\nStigma and cultural barriers compound access challenges. Rural communities often exhibit heightened stigma around mental illness and treatment-seeking. Small-town dynamics where “everybody knows everybody” undermine confidentiality. Religious and cultural values in some communities frame mental illness as personal weakness or spiritual failing rather than medical condition. These attitudes reduce care-seeking even when services exist.\nSubstance use disorder prevalence exceeds urban rates. Opioid deaths per capita have been higher in rural areas since 2015. Methamphetamine use shows particularly elevated rural prevalence. Drug injection and overdose deaths concentrate in communities with limited treatment access. The SUD crisis intersects with mental health conditions through high comorbidity rates, yet rural areas lack integrated treatment capacity.\nThe evidence gap mirrors the service gap. Most behavioral health research occurs in urban academic medical centers serving insured populations. Rural evidence is sparse. The interventions with strongest evidence bases, including collaborative care and cognitive behavioral therapy, were developed and tested in settings unlike rural communities. Extrapolating urban findings to rural contexts requires assumptions that may not hold.\nEvidence Review Research on behavioral health interventions varies substantially by intervention type and setting. Several approaches demonstrate strong evidence for efficacy, though rural-specific evidence remains limited for most.\nEvidence Rating Summary Intervention Evidence Quality Effect Size Rural Evidence Implementation Difficulty Collaborative care model Strong Moderate-Large Limited High SBIRT in primary care Strong Small-Moderate Yes Moderate Telebehavioral health Strong Moderate-Large Yes Low-Moderate CCBHC model Moderate Moderate Yes High MAT for opioid use disorder Strong Large Yes Moderate Hub-and-spoke for OUD Moderate Large Yes Moderate Crisis stabilization units Moderate Moderate Limited High Peer support specialists Moderate Small-Moderate Limited Low School-based mental health Moderate Moderate Yes Moderate Collaborative Care Model The Collaborative Care Model (CoCM) represents the most rigorously evaluated approach to integrating behavioral health into primary care. Developed at the University of Washington in the 1990s, CoCM structures treatment through five core components: population-based care, measurement-based treatment, care management, psychiatric consultation, and brief evidence-based psychotherapy.\nThe evidence base is robust. Over 90 randomized controlled trials demonstrate CoCM superiority over usual care for depression, anxiety, and other common mental health conditions. A 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis of 78 studies found consistent effect sizes of 0.20-0.33 across conditions and settings, with effects persisting at 24-month follow-up. The IMPACT trial, the seminal collaborative care study, showed that patients receiving collaborative care had 50 percent lower depression at 12 months compared to usual care.\nCoCM demonstrates particular effectiveness for comorbid conditions. The TEAMcare trial showed collaborative care improved depression, diabetes control, and cardiovascular risk simultaneously, providing 114 additional depression-free days and generating cost savings through reduced hospitalizations. These findings address the reality that rural patients often present with multiple chronic conditions requiring integrated management.\nCost-effectiveness evidence is favorable. Economic analyses find collaborative care cost-neutral or cost-saving compared to usual care when accounting for reduced hospitalizations, emergency visits, and improved chronic disease management. The Medicaid health home initiative builds on this evidence to support collaborative care implementation through enhanced payment.\nThe rural implementation challenge centers on psychiatric consultation capacity. CoCM requires psychiatrist time for caseload consultation, typically one to two hours weekly per panel of 50-100 patients. This consulting psychiatrist need not be on-site, enabling telepsychiatry models, but requires psychiatric access that many rural areas lack. States implementing CoCM without adequate consultation infrastructure will fail to achieve model fidelity and evidence-based outcomes.\nScreening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment SBIRT provides a structured approach for identifying and addressing substance use in general healthcare settings. The model involves universal screening using validated instruments, brief intervention for risky use, and referral to specialty treatment for those with disorders.\nEvidence supports SBIRT effectiveness for alcohol use reduction in primary care, emergency department, and other settings. Studies demonstrate modest but consistent reductions in alcohol consumption and related harms. Evidence for other substances is weaker, with mixed findings for drug use intervention effectiveness through brief primary care encounters.\nSBIRT’s value for rural behavioral health lies in systematic identification rather than treatment per se. Primary care providers conducting universal screening can identify patients requiring intervention before crisis presentation. The approach extends behavioral health reach through existing healthcare encounters.\nImplementation difficulty is moderate. Training requirements are manageable, typically involving 8-16 hours for clinical staff. Workflow integration requires electronic health record modification and sustained attention to screening rates. Many states have implemented SBIRT with Medicaid support, creating billing pathways that support sustainability.\nTelebehavioral Health Telehealth for behavioral health services shows consistently positive evidence across modalities and populations. The technology extends specialist access to areas without local providers, addresses stigma through private in-home delivery, and achieves clinical outcomes equivalent to in-person care.\nA systematic review examining telebehavioral health for depression found no significant difference in outcomes compared to face-to-face treatment. Studies of telepsychiatry consultation for primary care providers demonstrate improved patient outcomes and provider confidence. Telehealth-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy achieves effect sizes similar to in-person delivery.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic dramatically expanded telebehavioral health implementation and generated additional evidence. Medicare telehealth claims for behavioral health increased over 3,000 percent between 2019 and 2022. Studies of pandemic-era telebehavioral health found high patient satisfaction, equivalent clinical outcomes, and improved access for rural populations.\nRural-specific evidence is strong for telebehavioral health. The population’s geographic dispersion and provider scarcity create clear use cases. Studies in rural Veterans Administration facilities, Indian Health Service settings, and Federally Qualified Health Centers demonstrate feasibility and effectiveness.\nImplementation requirements are modest compared to other interventions. Technology infrastructure (broadband, devices, platforms) poses the primary barrier, though this has improved substantially since 2020. Payment parity remains variable by state and payer. The DEA’s temporary pandemic-era flexibilities for controlled substance prescribing via telehealth have been extended, supporting MAT delivery.\nCertified Community Behavioral Health Clinics CCBHCs represent a structural intervention establishing comprehensive behavioral health access points. Created under Section 223 of the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, CCBHCs must provide nine required service types including crisis services, screening and assessment, outpatient mental health and substance use treatment, primary care screening, targeted case management, and psychiatric rehabilitation.\nThe demonstration program, initially limited to eight states, has expanded substantially. As of 2025, all 50 states have CCBHCs through the demonstration, SAMHSA expansion grants, or state-funded programs. The prospective payment system provides cost-based reimbursement intended to cover full service costs.\nEvaluation evidence shows improved access and service expansion. CCBHCs serve 25 percent more patients on average than non-certified behavioral health clinics. Quality measure performance shows improvements in depression screening, follow-up after hospitalization, and physical health monitoring. Emergency department utilization findings are mixed, with some studies showing reductions and others showing increases related to newly identified conditions.\nRural CCBHC implementation faces challenges. The comprehensive service array requires workforce and infrastructure that many rural areas lack. Meeting certification standards for 24-hour crisis services, mobile crisis teams, and same-day access strains rural organizational capacity. Smaller clinics may struggle to achieve the scale required for financial viability under prospective payment.\nThe evidence base for CCBHCs is moderate rather than strong, primarily documenting process improvements and access expansion rather than clinical outcomes. The 2023 Report to Congress noted ongoing evaluation of utilization and cost impacts. Whether CCBHCs improve population health outcomes beyond service delivery metrics remains under investigation.\nMedication-Assisted Treatment for Opioid Use Disorder MAT using buprenorphine, methadone, or naltrexone represents the most effective treatment for opioid use disorder, with outcomes vastly superior to abstinence-only approaches. Meta-analyses demonstrate MAT reduces opioid use, overdose deaths, and infectious disease transmission while improving treatment retention.\nRural MAT access has expanded substantially since the 2016 Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act and subsequent policy changes. DATA 2000 waiver requirements for buprenorphine prescribing were eliminated in 2023, enabling any DEA-registered practitioner to prescribe without additional certification. This change theoretically expands prescriber capacity in rural areas with limited providers.\nPractical barriers persist despite regulatory flexibility. Many rural primary care providers remain reluctant to prescribe due to concerns about practice disruption, patient complexity, and inadequate behavioral health support. Rural patients may face long travel distances even when prescribers exist. Methadone treatment requires daily dosing at opioid treatment programs, which are scarce in rural areas.\nThe evidence strongly supports MAT effectiveness in rural settings. Studies of rural buprenorphine prescribing demonstrate retention and outcomes comparable to urban settings. The Vermont hub-and-spoke model provides the clearest evidence of rural MAT system effectiveness at state scale.\nHub-and-Spoke Models for Opioid Use Disorder Vermont’s hub-and-spoke system offers the most evaluated model for rural OUD treatment at population scale. Initiated in 2013, the system comprises regional hubs (opioid treatment programs with authority to dispense methadone and buprenorphine) and community spokes (primary care practices providing office-based buprenorphine treatment).\nEvaluation evidence demonstrates substantial positive impact. A 2017 assessment found patients in treatment reported 96 percent reduction in opioid use and elimination of overdoses. By 2019, Vermont achieved the highest OUD treatment capacity in the nation, with 10.56 people in treatment per 1,000 population, representing 1.7 percent of the adult population receiving MAT. Healthcare costs for Medicaid recipients in MAT were lower than for untreated individuals with OUD.\nThe model addresses rural workforce constraints through task-shifting and consultation. Hub addiction specialists provide intensive treatment and support spokes through consultation, training, and care coordination. Spokes integrate OUD treatment into general medical care with staffing of one nurse and one licensed counselor per 100 patients. Patients move bidirectionally between settings as clinical needs change.\nWashington, California, and other states have adapted the model with similar early results. The approach requires state-level coordination, sustainable financing (Vermont uses Medicaid health home payment), and willingness to build new organizational relationships between specialty and primary care settings.\nImplementation difficulty is moderate to high. Establishing hub infrastructure requires specialty treatment capacity that may not exist in all states. Building spoke capacity requires primary care practice change, staff additions, and sustained support. The model operates at state scale rather than community or facility level.\nCrisis Stabilization and Mobile Crisis Crisis services represent a critical gap in rural behavioral health systems. Without local psychiatric beds, mobile crisis teams, or crisis stabilization units, behavioral health emergencies default to emergency departments, jails, or dangerous situations without intervention.\nEvidence for crisis services is moderate and largely from urban settings. Studies demonstrate that mobile crisis teams reduce emergency department utilization, psychiatric hospitalizations, and law enforcement involvement. Crisis stabilization units provide alternatives to inpatient admission for patients who do not require hospital-level care.\nRural implementation faces severe challenges. Mobile crisis teams require response-time commitments (often 60 minutes or less) that become impossible across large geographic areas. Staffing mobile teams for 24/7 availability requires workforce that rural areas lack. Crisis stabilization units require capital investment and operational capacity beyond most rural communities.\nThe 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline provides national infrastructure for crisis response coordination, but local service capacity determines follow-up capability. Answering calls requires connection to services that may not exist in rural areas.\nRHTP applications frequently propose crisis system development without addressing these fundamental constraints. States claiming to build rural mobile crisis coverage should demonstrate how response-time standards will be met across large distances with limited workforce.\nPeer Support Specialists Peer support services leverage individuals with lived experience of mental illness or substance use disorder to provide recovery support. The approach extends workforce capacity through non-clinical providers and addresses stigma through shared experience.\nEvidence supports peer support effectiveness for engagement, retention, and recovery support, though effects on clinical outcomes are smaller and less consistent than for clinical interventions. Studies find peer support improves treatment engagement, reduces hospitalizations, and enhances quality of life. Effects are strongest for substance use disorder recovery support.\nRural peer support faces implementation advantages and challenges. On one hand, peer specialists can be recruited locally, trained relatively quickly (typically 40-75 hours), and deployed without clinical licensure requirements. Medicaid reimburses peer support services in over 40 states, supporting sustainability. On the other hand, maintaining appropriate boundaries in small communities where peers and clients may know each other requires careful management.\nSchool-Based Mental Health School-based mental health services address childhood and adolescent behavioral health through the setting where young people spend most waking hours. The approach reduces access barriers, destigmatizes treatment, and enables early intervention.\nEvidence supports school-based mental health effectiveness for depression, anxiety, and behavioral problems among children and adolescents. Meta-analyses find moderate effect sizes for school-based interventions. Programs combining screening, group intervention, and individual treatment show strongest effects.\nRural schools face implementation challenges. Workforce shortages affect school counseling and social work positions. Small schools may lack dedicated mental health staff entirely. Telehealth can extend services to rural schools but requires technology infrastructure and appropriate physical spaces for confidential sessions.\nState Program Examples State Program Scale Outcomes Key Lessons Vermont Hub-and-Spoke OUD Statewide 10.56 per 1,000 in MAT; 96% opioid use reduction State coordination and Medicaid financing essential North Carolina CCBHC Expansion 20+ clinics Increased access; reduced wait times Prospective payment supports comprehensive services Alaska Behavioral Health Integration Tribal health system Integrated care delivery; telehealth expansion Cultural adaptation and tribal governance critical Washington Hub-and-Spoke Adaptation Statewide Expanded MAT access Replication requires state-specific adaptation Minnesota CCBHC Demonstration Original 8-state demo Quality measure improvements Certification requirements create implementation burden Missouri CCBHC Demonstration Original 8-state demo Access expansion Rural CCBHCs face scale challenges RHTP Application Assessment What States Are Proposing Behavioral health appears in 100 percent of RHTP applications. Every state identifies behavioral health as a priority, proposes some form of investment, and commits to service expansion. The specificity and evidence alignment of these proposals varies substantially.\nCommon RHTP behavioral health strategies include:\nTelehealth expansion (49 states) represents the most frequent behavioral health intervention. States propose extending telebehavioral health to primary care sites, schools, and patient homes. Evidence alignment is strong for this approach.\nWorkforce recruitment (45 states) proposes loan repayment, training slots, and incentives for behavioral health providers. Evidence suggests limited effectiveness for rural workforce, particularly for psychiatrists. States emphasizing psychiatrist recruitment over integration strategies will likely underperform.\nIntegration initiatives (38 states) propose embedding behavioral health in primary care. Specificity varies from detailed collaborative care implementation to vague mentions of “integration.” States specifying CoCM or similar evidence-based models show stronger evidence alignment than those proposing undefined integration.\nCCBHC development (32 states) proposes establishing or expanding Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics. This approach supports comprehensive services but requires substantial organizational capacity that may not exist in all rural areas.\nCrisis system investment (28 states) proposes mobile crisis teams, crisis stabilization units, and 988 coordination. Few applications address how response-time standards will be met across rural distances.\nSUD treatment expansion (42 states) proposes MAT access, hub-and-spoke models, or SUD-specific services. Evidence alignment is strong for MAT and hub-and-spoke approaches.\nEvidence Alignment Analysis Strongest alignment:\nStates proposing collaborative care implementation with specific model fidelity requirements States expanding telebehavioral health with quality standards States building hub-and-spoke OUD treatment systems States targeting MAT capacity expansion Weakest alignment:\nStates proposing psychiatrist recruitment as primary strategy States describing “integration” without specifying evidence-based models States proposing rural mobile crisis without addressing geographic feasibility States claiming CCBHC expansion without adequate organizational infrastructure Red flags in applications:\nBehavioral health workforce targets implying psychiatrist recruitment at implausible rates Crisis service commitments without distance and travel-time analysis CCBHC certification plans without existing behavioral health organizational capacity Integration language without model specification or outcome accountability Implementation Reality Success Factors Effective rural behavioral health programs share common characteristics:\nPrimary care integration with specialist consultation. The collaborative care model and hub-and-spoke approach both leverage limited specialist capacity through consultation rather than direct service delivery. Primary care serves as the platform, with psychiatric expertise available remotely.\nSustainable financing beyond grants. Medicaid billing pathways, health home payment, CCBHC prospective payment, and other sustainable financing mechanisms matter more than initial grant funding. Programs dependent on time-limited grants face discontinuation when funding ends.\nTechnology as infrastructure. Telehealth, electronic health records, and care registries enable population management that paper-based systems cannot achieve. Technology investment supports rather than replaces workforce.\nState-level coordination. Vermont’s hub-and-spoke success required state coordination across Medicaid, public health, and regulatory agencies. Individual facility or county efforts cannot achieve system-level change.\nFailure Patterns Workforce-first strategies without systems. Recruiting behavioral health providers to rural areas without integration infrastructure produces isolated practitioners who burn out or leave. Workforce investment requires practice support investment.\nGrant-funded positions without sustainability planning. Time-limited positions attract early-career providers who leave when funding ends. States should specify Medicaid or other sustainable financing from program initiation.\nCrisis services without capacity. Launching 988 or crisis programs without local service capacity to respond creates expectations that cannot be met. Call centers are necessary but insufficient.\nModel infidelity. Implementing “collaborative care” without care managers, psychiatric consultation, or measurement-based treatment will not achieve collaborative care outcomes. Labels do not equal implementation.\nImplementation Requirements by Model Model Minimum Infrastructure Workforce Financing Timeline to Effectiveness Collaborative Care Primary care practice; EHR; registry Care manager; consulting psychiatrist Billing codes (99492-99494); health home 12-18 months Telebehavioral Health Broadband; devices; platform Remote providers; local support Telehealth parity 6-12 months CCBHC Comprehensive services; crisis capacity Full behavioral health team Prospective payment 18-24 months Hub-and-Spoke OUD Hub OTP; spoke practices Addiction medicine; MAT prescribers Health home; Medicaid SPA 12-24 months The 2030 Question RHTP investments in behavioral health face sustainability questions that state applications rarely address:\nWill integration become permanent or grant-funded? Collaborative care and primary care behavioral health integration can be sustained through existing Medicaid billing codes and health home payment. States building these pathways create durable capacity. States treating integration as grant-funded demonstration will see reversal when RHTP ends.\nWill CCBHC prospective payment continue? The CCBHC demonstration has been extended repeatedly by Congress. Whether prospective payment continues at current levels post-RHTP remains uncertain. Rural CCBHCs dependent on enhanced payment face viability questions if reimbursement declines.\nWhat happens to crisis investments? Crisis stabilization units and mobile crisis teams require ongoing operational funding that far exceeds initial capital investment. States building crisis infrastructure must identify operational financing for the post-2030 period.\nCan telebehavioral health gains be maintained? Pandemic-era regulatory flexibilities expanded telehealth dramatically. Most flexibilities have been extended or made permanent, but payment rates and coverage requirements vary by state and payer. Sustained telebehavioral health capacity depends on continued payment support.\nWill behavioral health workforce shortages worsen? HRSA projects substantial shortages through 2036 across behavioral health professions. Even successful RHTP workforce investments cannot reverse broader trends. States should plan for persistent shortages rather than workforce sufficiency.\nThe honest assessment: behavioral health transformation within RHTP’s five-year window is achievable through integration, telehealth, and systems approaches. Workforce transformation is not. States promising to eliminate behavioral health shortages or achieve provider ratios comparable to urban areas are making commitments they cannot keep.\nConclusion Rural behavioral health crisis requires responding to a fundamental constraint: the workforce to deliver traditional psychiatric care will not exist within RHTP’s timeline or likely beyond it. Strategies premised on recruiting psychiatrists and psychiatric specialists to rural areas will fail. Strategies that extend limited expertise through integration, consultation, technology, and alternative workforces have evidence-based pathways to meaningful improvement.\nEffective behavioral health strategy requires:\nIntegration as primary modality. Collaborative care, delivered through primary care with psychiatric consultation, represents the most evidence-supported approach for rural behavioral health. States should specify CoCM or equivalent models, ensure implementation fidelity, and build sustainable financing through Medicaid billing.\nTelehealth as infrastructure. Telebehavioral health should be treated as standard care delivery rather than innovation. States should ensure broadband access, platform availability, payment parity, and quality standards for telehealth-delivered behavioral health services.\nSystems for substance use disorder. Hub-and-spoke models for OUD treatment demonstrate effectiveness at state scale. States should build MAT capacity through primary care, establish hub consultation infrastructure, and create bidirectional referral pathways.\nRealistic crisis expectations. Crisis system development in rural areas requires acknowledging geographic constraints. States should invest in telehealth crisis response, regional crisis stabilization, and care coordination rather than claiming universal mobile crisis coverage that cannot be delivered.\nWorkforce diversification. Peer support specialists, community health workers with behavioral health training, and other non-traditional providers extend capacity that licensed clinicians alone cannot provide. States should build these workforces with clear roles, adequate supervision, and sustainable financing.\nThe fundamental tension persists: rural America needs behavioral health services that the behavioral health workforce cannot deliver. RHTP offers an opportunity to build systems that work within this constraint through integration, technology, and task-shifting. States pursuing traditional workforce strategies will spend five years discovering what evidence already shows: psychiatrists are not coming to rural America in meaningful numbers. The question is whether states will use RHTP to build alternatives that work or invest in approaches that cannot succeed.\nCross-References Related Series 2 Articles\n2A: RHTP Structure and Rules (behavioral health investment requirements) 2B: Medicaid Architecture and the $911B Question (behavioral health financing sustainability) 2D: HRSA Rural Programs (behavioral health workforce programs) 2H: The 2030 Cliff (post-sunset behavioral health implications) Related Series 4 Transformation Approaches\n4B: Workforce Recruitment and Retention (behavioral health workforce crisis) 4C: Telehealth and Virtual Care (telebehavioral health delivery) 4D: Community Health Workers (peer support and non-clinical workforce) 4F: Payment Model Innovation (behavioral health payment reform) State Profile Examples\n3.VT (Vermont): Hub-and-spoke OUD treatment model 3.NC (North Carolina): CCBHC expansion 3.AK (Alaska): Tribal behavioral health integration Sources Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. “Integration of Mental Health/Substance Abuse and Primary Care.” AHRQ Evidence Report No. 173, Oct. 2008, effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov.\nAIMS Center, University of Washington. “Evidence Base for Collaborative Care (CoCM).” AIMS Center, Oct. 2025, aims.uw.edu/evidence-base-for-cocm/.\nBrooklyn, John R., and Stacey C.

<p>Rural America faces a behavioral health crisis without the workforce to address it. <strong>Over 80 percent of rural counties carry mental health Health Professional Shortage Area designations.</strong> Many counties have no psychiatrists at all, with ratios exceeding 30,000 residents per provider in designated shortage areas. The 2024 National Survey on Drug Use and Health reported that approximately 7.2 million nonmetropolitan adults experienced mental illness, representing 22.9 percent of the rural adult population, yet services remain systematically unavailable.</p>
<p>Every RHTP application includes behavioral health investment. Every state acknowledges the crisis. Nearly every state proposes some combination of telehealth expansion, integration into primary care, crisis system development, and workforce recruitment. Yet the fundamental question persists: <strong>how do you deliver mental health treatment in communities where traditional psychiatric care cannot exist?</strong></p>
<p>The answer emerging from research and implementation experience centers on <strong>workforce substitution and integration</strong>. Rather than importing psychiatrists who will not come, effective rural behavioral health strategies extend existing primary care capacity through collaborative care models, leverage technology through telebehavioral health, develop alternative workforces through peer support and community health workers, and build regional systems that concentrate scarce specialty expertise at hubs while supporting local delivery at spokes.</p>
<p>This article examines what the evidence actually shows about rural behavioral health interventions, identifies models with demonstrated effectiveness, and assesses whether RHTP investments align with proven approaches. The findings suggest that <strong>states emphasizing traditional workforce recruitment over integration and task-shifting will fail</strong>, while states building sustainable systems around collaborative care, telebehavioral health, and hub-and-spoke networks have pathways to meaningful improvement.</p>
<h2 id="the-rural-context">The Rural Context<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-rural-context">#</a></h2>
<p>Behavioral health service delivery in rural America operates under constraints fundamentally different from urban settings. Understanding these constraints is essential for evaluating intervention evidence and assessing RHTP implementation prospects.</p>
<p><strong>Psychiatrist availability approaches zero in many rural areas.</strong> While the national psychiatrist to population ratio is approximately 16.8 per 100,000, rural counties average fewer than 5 per 100,000, and many frontier counties have none. HRSA data through 2025 document <strong>3,862 mental health HPSAs in rural areas</strong>, requiring an estimated 1,682 additional practitioners to remove designations. Unlike primary care shortages that might be addressed through physician assistant and nurse practitioner expansion, psychiatrist shortages have no direct substitute under traditional care models.</p>
<p><strong>Workforce projections offer no relief.</strong> HRSA&rsquo;s behavioral health workforce brief projects substantial shortages through 2036 across psychiatrists, psychologists, counselors, and marriage and family therapists. Psychiatry residency training takes 12-13 years from undergraduate entry to independent practice. Even aggressive training expansion initiated now produces no meaningful rural supply increase within RHTP&rsquo;s timeline. The pipeline solution does not exist for behavioral health within the program period.</p>
<p><strong>Emergency departments serve as the de facto crisis system.</strong> Without psychiatric beds, mobile crisis teams, or crisis stabilization units, rural hospitals absorb behavioral health emergencies they cannot appropriately treat. Patients presenting in psychiatric crisis may wait hours or days for transfer to distant facilities. Some rural emergency departments report <strong>behavioral health patients accounting for 10-20 percent of total visits</strong>, straining resources while delivering suboptimal care.</p>
<p><strong>Stigma and cultural barriers compound access challenges.</strong> Rural communities often exhibit heightened stigma around mental illness and treatment-seeking. Small-town dynamics where &ldquo;everybody knows everybody&rdquo; undermine confidentiality. Religious and cultural values in some communities frame mental illness as personal weakness or spiritual failing rather than medical condition. These attitudes reduce care-seeking even when services exist.</p>
<p><strong>Substance use disorder prevalence exceeds urban rates.</strong> Opioid deaths per capita have been higher in rural areas since 2015. Methamphetamine use shows particularly elevated rural prevalence. Drug injection and overdose deaths concentrate in communities with limited treatment access. The SUD crisis intersects with mental health conditions through high comorbidity rates, yet rural areas lack integrated treatment capacity.</p>
<p><strong>The evidence gap mirrors the service gap.</strong> Most behavioral health research occurs in urban academic medical centers serving insured populations. Rural evidence is sparse. The interventions with strongest evidence bases, including collaborative care and cognitive behavioral therapy, were developed and tested in settings unlike rural communities. Extrapolating urban findings to rural contexts requires assumptions that may not hold.</p>
<h2 id="evidence-review">Evidence Review<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#evidence-review">#</a></h2>
<p>Research on behavioral health interventions varies substantially by intervention type and setting. Several approaches demonstrate strong evidence for efficacy, though rural-specific evidence remains limited for most.</p>

<h3 id="collaborative-care-model">Collaborative Care Model<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#collaborative-care-model">#</a></h3>
<p>The <strong>Collaborative Care Model (CoCM)</strong> represents the most rigorously evaluated approach to integrating behavioral health into primary care. Developed at the University of Washington in the 1990s, CoCM structures treatment through five core components: <strong>population-based care, measurement-based treatment, care management, psychiatric consultation, and brief evidence-based psychotherapy.</strong></p>
<p>The evidence base is robust. <strong>Over 90 randomized controlled trials</strong> demonstrate CoCM superiority over usual care for depression, anxiety, and other common mental health conditions. A 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis of 78 studies found consistent effect sizes of <strong>0.20-0.33</strong> across conditions and settings, with effects persisting at 24-month follow-up. The IMPACT trial, the seminal collaborative care study, showed that patients receiving collaborative care had <strong>50 percent lower depression at 12 months</strong> compared to usual care.</p>
<p>CoCM demonstrates particular effectiveness for comorbid conditions. The TEAMcare trial showed collaborative care improved depression, diabetes control, and cardiovascular risk simultaneously, providing <strong>114 additional depression-free days</strong> and generating cost savings through reduced hospitalizations. These findings address the reality that rural patients often present with multiple chronic conditions requiring integrated management.</p>
<p><strong>Cost-effectiveness evidence is favorable.</strong> Economic analyses find collaborative care cost-neutral or cost-saving compared to usual care when accounting for reduced hospitalizations, emergency visits, and improved chronic disease management. The Medicaid health home initiative builds on this evidence to support collaborative care implementation through enhanced payment.</p>
<p>The rural implementation challenge centers on <strong>psychiatric consultation capacity</strong>. CoCM requires psychiatrist time for caseload consultation, typically one to two hours weekly per panel of 50-100 patients. This consulting psychiatrist need not be on-site, enabling telepsychiatry models, but requires psychiatric access that many rural areas lack. States implementing CoCM without adequate consultation infrastructure will fail to achieve model fidelity and evidence-based outcomes.</p>
<h3 id="screening-brief-intervention-and-referral-to-treatment">Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#screening-brief-intervention-and-referral-to-treatment">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>SBIRT</strong> provides a structured approach for identifying and addressing substance use in general healthcare settings. The model involves universal screening using validated instruments, brief intervention for risky use, and referral to specialty treatment for those with disorders.</p>
<p>Evidence supports SBIRT effectiveness for <strong>alcohol use reduction</strong> in primary care, emergency department, and other settings. Studies demonstrate modest but consistent reductions in alcohol consumption and related harms. <strong>Evidence for other substances is weaker</strong>, with mixed findings for drug use intervention effectiveness through brief primary care encounters.</p>
<p>SBIRT&rsquo;s value for rural behavioral health lies in <strong>systematic identification</strong> rather than treatment per se. Primary care providers conducting universal screening can identify patients requiring intervention before crisis presentation. The approach extends behavioral health reach through existing healthcare encounters.</p>
<p>Implementation difficulty is moderate. Training requirements are manageable, typically involving 8-16 hours for clinical staff. Workflow integration requires electronic health record modification and sustained attention to screening rates. Many states have implemented SBIRT with Medicaid support, creating billing pathways that support sustainability.</p>
<h3 id="telebehavioral-health">Telebehavioral Health<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#telebehavioral-health">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Telehealth for behavioral health services</strong> shows consistently positive evidence across modalities and populations. The technology extends specialist access to areas without local providers, addresses stigma through private in-home delivery, and achieves clinical outcomes equivalent to in-person care.</p>
<p>A systematic review examining telebehavioral health for depression found <strong>no significant difference in outcomes compared to face-to-face treatment</strong>. Studies of telepsychiatry consultation for primary care providers demonstrate improved patient outcomes and provider confidence. Telehealth-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy achieves effect sizes similar to in-person delivery.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic dramatically expanded telebehavioral health implementation and generated additional evidence. Medicare telehealth claims for behavioral health increased over <strong>3,000 percent</strong> between 2019 and 2022. Studies of pandemic-era telebehavioral health found high patient satisfaction, equivalent clinical outcomes, and improved access for rural populations.</p>
<p>Rural-specific evidence is strong for telebehavioral health. The population&rsquo;s geographic dispersion and provider scarcity create clear use cases. Studies in rural Veterans Administration facilities, Indian Health Service settings, and Federally Qualified Health Centers demonstrate feasibility and effectiveness.</p>
<p><strong>Implementation requirements are modest</strong> compared to other interventions. Technology infrastructure (broadband, devices, platforms) poses the primary barrier, though this has improved substantially since 2020. Payment parity remains variable by state and payer. The DEA&rsquo;s temporary pandemic-era flexibilities for controlled substance prescribing via telehealth have been extended, supporting MAT delivery.</p>
<h3 id="certified-community-behavioral-health-clinics">Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#certified-community-behavioral-health-clinics">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>CCBHCs</strong> represent a structural intervention establishing comprehensive behavioral health access points. Created under Section 223 of the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, CCBHCs must provide nine required service types including crisis services, screening and assessment, outpatient mental health and substance use treatment, primary care screening, targeted case management, and psychiatric rehabilitation.</p>
<p>The demonstration program, initially limited to eight states, has expanded substantially. As of 2025, <strong>all 50 states</strong> have CCBHCs through the demonstration, SAMHSA expansion grants, or state-funded programs. The prospective payment system provides cost-based reimbursement intended to cover full service costs.</p>
<p>Evaluation evidence shows <strong>improved access and service expansion</strong>. CCBHCs serve 25 percent more patients on average than non-certified behavioral health clinics. Quality measure performance shows improvements in depression screening, follow-up after hospitalization, and physical health monitoring. Emergency department utilization findings are mixed, with some studies showing reductions and others showing increases related to newly identified conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Rural CCBHC implementation faces challenges.</strong> The comprehensive service array requires workforce and infrastructure that many rural areas lack. Meeting certification standards for 24-hour crisis services, mobile crisis teams, and same-day access strains rural organizational capacity. Smaller clinics may struggle to achieve the scale required for financial viability under prospective payment.</p>
<p>The evidence base for CCBHCs is <strong>moderate rather than strong</strong>, primarily documenting process improvements and access expansion rather than clinical outcomes. The 2023 Report to Congress noted ongoing evaluation of utilization and cost impacts. Whether CCBHCs improve population health outcomes beyond service delivery metrics remains under investigation.</p>
<h3 id="medication-assisted-treatment-for-opioid-use-disorder">Medication-Assisted Treatment for Opioid Use Disorder<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#medication-assisted-treatment-for-opioid-use-disorder">#</a></h3>
<p>MAT using buprenorphine, methadone, or naltrexone represents the <strong>most effective treatment for opioid use disorder</strong>, with outcomes vastly superior to abstinence-only approaches. Meta-analyses demonstrate MAT reduces opioid use, overdose deaths, and infectious disease transmission while improving treatment retention.</p>
<p>Rural MAT access has expanded substantially since the 2016 Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act and subsequent policy changes. <strong>DATA 2000 waiver requirements</strong> for buprenorphine prescribing were eliminated in 2023, enabling any DEA-registered practitioner to prescribe without additional certification. This change theoretically expands prescriber capacity in rural areas with limited providers.</p>
<p>Practical barriers persist despite regulatory flexibility. <strong>Many rural primary care providers remain reluctant to prescribe</strong> due to concerns about practice disruption, patient complexity, and inadequate behavioral health support. Rural patients may face long travel distances even when prescribers exist. Methadone treatment requires daily dosing at opioid treatment programs, which are scarce in rural areas.</p>
<p>The evidence strongly supports MAT effectiveness in rural settings. Studies of rural buprenorphine prescribing demonstrate retention and outcomes comparable to urban settings. The Vermont hub-and-spoke model provides the clearest evidence of rural MAT system effectiveness at state scale.</p>
<h3 id="hub-and-spoke-models-for-opioid-use-disorder">Hub-and-Spoke Models for Opioid Use Disorder<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#hub-and-spoke-models-for-opioid-use-disorder">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Vermont&rsquo;s hub-and-spoke system</strong> offers the most evaluated model for rural OUD treatment at population scale. Initiated in 2013, the system comprises regional hubs (opioid treatment programs with authority to dispense methadone and buprenorphine) and community spokes (primary care practices providing office-based buprenorphine treatment).</p>
<p>Evaluation evidence demonstrates <strong>substantial positive impact</strong>. A 2017 assessment found patients in treatment reported 96 percent reduction in opioid use and elimination of overdoses. By 2019, Vermont achieved the highest OUD treatment capacity in the nation, with <strong>10.56 people in treatment per 1,000 population</strong>, representing 1.7 percent of the adult population receiving MAT. Healthcare costs for Medicaid recipients in MAT were lower than for untreated individuals with OUD.</p>
<p>The model addresses rural workforce constraints through <strong>task-shifting and consultation</strong>. Hub addiction specialists provide intensive treatment and support spokes through consultation, training, and care coordination. Spokes integrate OUD treatment into general medical care with staffing of one nurse and one licensed counselor per 100 patients. Patients move bidirectionally between settings as clinical needs change.</p>
<p><strong>Washington, California, and other states have adapted the model</strong> with similar early results. The approach requires state-level coordination, sustainable financing (Vermont uses Medicaid health home payment), and willingness to build new organizational relationships between specialty and primary care settings.</p>
<p>Implementation difficulty is moderate to high. Establishing hub infrastructure requires specialty treatment capacity that may not exist in all states. Building spoke capacity requires primary care practice change, staff additions, and sustained support. The model operates at state scale rather than community or facility level.</p>
<h3 id="crisis-stabilization-and-mobile-crisis">Crisis Stabilization and Mobile Crisis<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#crisis-stabilization-and-mobile-crisis">#</a></h3>
<p>Crisis services represent a critical gap in rural behavioral health systems. Without local psychiatric beds, mobile crisis teams, or crisis stabilization units, behavioral health emergencies default to emergency departments, jails, or dangerous situations without intervention.</p>
<p><strong>Evidence for crisis services</strong> is moderate and largely from urban settings. Studies demonstrate that mobile crisis teams reduce emergency department utilization, psychiatric hospitalizations, and law enforcement involvement. Crisis stabilization units provide alternatives to inpatient admission for patients who do not require hospital-level care.</p>
<p>Rural implementation faces severe challenges. <strong>Mobile crisis teams require response-time commitments</strong> (often 60 minutes or less) that become impossible across large geographic areas. Staffing mobile teams for 24/7 availability requires workforce that rural areas lack. Crisis stabilization units require capital investment and operational capacity beyond most rural communities.</p>
<p>The 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline provides national infrastructure for crisis response coordination, but <strong>local service capacity determines follow-up capability</strong>. Answering calls requires connection to services that may not exist in rural areas.</p>
<p>RHTP applications frequently propose crisis system development without addressing these fundamental constraints. States claiming to build rural mobile crisis coverage should demonstrate how response-time standards will be met across large distances with limited workforce.</p>
<h3 id="peer-support-specialists">Peer Support Specialists<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#peer-support-specialists">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Peer support services</strong> leverage individuals with lived experience of mental illness or substance use disorder to provide recovery support. The approach extends workforce capacity through non-clinical providers and addresses stigma through shared experience.</p>
<p>Evidence supports peer support effectiveness for <strong>engagement, retention, and recovery support</strong>, though effects on clinical outcomes are smaller and less consistent than for clinical interventions. Studies find peer support improves treatment engagement, reduces hospitalizations, and enhances quality of life. Effects are strongest for substance use disorder recovery support.</p>
<p>Rural peer support faces implementation advantages and challenges. On one hand, peer specialists can be recruited locally, trained relatively quickly (typically 40-75 hours), and deployed without clinical licensure requirements. <strong>Medicaid reimburses peer support services in over 40 states</strong>, supporting sustainability. On the other hand, maintaining appropriate boundaries in small communities where peers and clients may know each other requires careful management.</p>
<h3 id="school-based-mental-health">School-Based Mental Health<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#school-based-mental-health">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>School-based mental health services</strong> address childhood and adolescent behavioral health through the setting where young people spend most waking hours. The approach reduces access barriers, destigmatizes treatment, and enables early intervention.</p>
<p>Evidence supports school-based mental health effectiveness for <strong>depression, anxiety, and behavioral problems</strong> among children and adolescents. Meta-analyses find moderate effect sizes for school-based interventions. Programs combining screening, group intervention, and individual treatment show strongest effects.</p>
<p>Rural schools face implementation challenges. <strong>Workforce shortages affect school counseling and social work</strong> positions. Small schools may lack dedicated mental health staff entirely. Telehealth can extend services to rural schools but requires technology infrastructure and appropriate physical spaces for confidential sessions.</p>

<p>Behavioral health appears in <strong>100 percent of RHTP applications</strong>. Every state identifies behavioral health as a priority, proposes some form of investment, and commits to service expansion. The specificity and evidence alignment of these proposals varies substantially.</p>
<p><strong>Common RHTP behavioral health strategies include:</strong></p>
<p>Telehealth expansion (49 states) represents the most frequent behavioral health intervention. States propose extending telebehavioral health to primary care sites, schools, and patient homes. Evidence alignment is strong for this approach.</p>
<p>Workforce recruitment (45 states) proposes loan repayment, training slots, and incentives for behavioral health providers. Evidence suggests limited effectiveness for rural workforce, particularly for psychiatrists. States emphasizing psychiatrist recruitment over integration strategies will likely underperform.</p>
<p>Integration initiatives (38 states) propose embedding behavioral health in primary care. Specificity varies from detailed collaborative care implementation to vague mentions of &ldquo;integration.&rdquo; States specifying CoCM or similar evidence-based models show stronger evidence alignment than those proposing undefined integration.</p>
<p>CCBHC development (32 states) proposes establishing or expanding Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics. This approach supports comprehensive services but requires substantial organizational capacity that may not exist in all rural areas.</p>
<p>Crisis system investment (28 states) proposes mobile crisis teams, crisis stabilization units, and 988 coordination. Few applications address how response-time standards will be met across rural distances.</p>
<p>SUD treatment expansion (42 states) proposes MAT access, hub-and-spoke models, or SUD-specific services. Evidence alignment is strong for MAT and hub-and-spoke approaches.</p>

<h3 id="success-factors">Success Factors<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#success-factors">#</a></h3>
<p>Effective rural behavioral health programs share common characteristics:</p>
<p><strong>Primary care integration with specialist consultation.</strong> The collaborative care model and hub-and-spoke approach both leverage limited specialist capacity through consultation rather than direct service delivery. Primary care serves as the platform, with psychiatric expertise available remotely.</p>
<p><strong>Sustainable financing beyond grants.</strong> Medicaid billing pathways, health home payment, CCBHC prospective payment, and other sustainable financing mechanisms matter more than initial grant funding. Programs dependent on time-limited grants face discontinuation when funding ends.</p>
<p><strong>Technology as infrastructure.</strong> Telehealth, electronic health records, and care registries enable population management that paper-based systems cannot achieve. Technology investment supports rather than replaces workforce.</p>
<p><strong>State-level coordination.</strong> Vermont&rsquo;s hub-and-spoke success required state coordination across Medicaid, public health, and regulatory agencies. Individual facility or county efforts cannot achieve system-level change.</p>
<h3 id="failure-patterns">Failure Patterns<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#failure-patterns">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Workforce-first strategies without systems.</strong> Recruiting behavioral health providers to rural areas without integration infrastructure produces isolated practitioners who burn out or leave. Workforce investment requires practice support investment.</p>
<p><strong>Grant-funded positions without sustainability planning.</strong> Time-limited positions attract early-career providers who leave when funding ends. States should specify Medicaid or other sustainable financing from program initiation.</p>
<p><strong>Crisis services without capacity.</strong> Launching 988 or crisis programs without local service capacity to respond creates expectations that cannot be met. Call centers are necessary but insufficient.</p>
<p><strong>Model infidelity.</strong> Implementing &ldquo;collaborative care&rdquo; without care managers, psychiatric consultation, or measurement-based treatment will not achieve collaborative care outcomes. Labels do not equal implementation.</p>

<h2 id="the-2030-question">The 2030 Question<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-2030-question">#</a></h2>
<p>RHTP investments in behavioral health face sustainability questions that state applications rarely address:</p>
<p><strong>Will integration become permanent or grant-funded?</strong> Collaborative care and primary care behavioral health integration can be sustained through existing Medicaid billing codes and health home payment. States building these pathways create durable capacity. States treating integration as grant-funded demonstration will see reversal when RHTP ends.</p>
<p><strong>Will CCBHC prospective payment continue?</strong> The CCBHC demonstration has been extended repeatedly by Congress. Whether prospective payment continues at current levels post-RHTP remains uncertain. Rural CCBHCs dependent on enhanced payment face viability questions if reimbursement declines.</p>
<p><strong>What happens to crisis investments?</strong> Crisis stabilization units and mobile crisis teams require ongoing operational funding that far exceeds initial capital investment. States building crisis infrastructure must identify operational financing for the post-2030 period.</p>
<p><strong>Can telebehavioral health gains be maintained?</strong> Pandemic-era regulatory flexibilities expanded telehealth dramatically. Most flexibilities have been extended or made permanent, but payment rates and coverage requirements vary by state and payer. Sustained telebehavioral health capacity depends on continued payment support.</p>
<p><strong>Will behavioral health workforce shortages worsen?</strong> HRSA projects substantial shortages through 2036 across behavioral health professions. Even successful RHTP workforce investments cannot reverse broader trends. States should plan for persistent shortages rather than workforce sufficiency.</p>
<p>The honest assessment: behavioral health transformation within RHTP&rsquo;s five-year window is achievable through integration, telehealth, and systems approaches. Workforce transformation is not. <strong>States promising to eliminate behavioral health shortages or achieve provider ratios comparable to urban areas are making commitments they cannot keep.</strong></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>Rural behavioral health crisis requires responding to a fundamental constraint: <strong>the workforce to deliver traditional psychiatric care will not exist within RHTP&rsquo;s timeline or likely beyond it.</strong> Strategies premised on recruiting psychiatrists and psychiatric specialists to rural areas will fail. Strategies that extend limited expertise through integration, consultation, technology, and alternative workforces have evidence-based pathways to meaningful improvement.</p>
<p>Effective behavioral health strategy requires:</p>
<p><strong>Integration as primary modality.</strong> Collaborative care, delivered through primary care with psychiatric consultation, represents the most evidence-supported approach for rural behavioral health. States should specify CoCM or equivalent models, ensure implementation fidelity, and build sustainable financing through Medicaid billing.</p>
<p><strong>Telehealth as infrastructure.</strong> Telebehavioral health should be treated as standard care delivery rather than innovation. States should ensure broadband access, platform availability, payment parity, and quality standards for telehealth-delivered behavioral health services.</p>
<p><strong>Systems for substance use disorder.</strong> Hub-and-spoke models for OUD treatment demonstrate effectiveness at state scale. States should build MAT capacity through primary care, establish hub consultation infrastructure, and create bidirectional referral pathways.</p>
<p><strong>Realistic crisis expectations.</strong> Crisis system development in rural areas requires acknowledging geographic constraints. States should invest in telehealth crisis response, regional crisis stabilization, and care coordination rather than claiming universal mobile crisis coverage that cannot be delivered.</p>
<p><strong>Workforce diversification.</strong> Peer support specialists, community health workers with behavioral health training, and other non-traditional providers extend capacity that licensed clinicians alone cannot provide. States should build these workforces with clear roles, adequate supervision, and sustainable financing.</p>
<p>The fundamental tension persists: <strong>rural America needs behavioral health services that the behavioral health workforce cannot deliver.</strong> RHTP offers an opportunity to build systems that work within this constraint through integration, technology, and task-shifting. States pursuing traditional workforce strategies will spend five years discovering what evidence already shows: psychiatrists are not coming to rural America in meaningful numbers. The question is whether states will use RHTP to build alternatives that work or invest in approaches that cannot succeed.</p>
