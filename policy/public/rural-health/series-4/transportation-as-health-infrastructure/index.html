  "articleBody": "What moves people when transit doesn’t exist?\nIntroduction Distance is destiny in rural healthcare. A patient who cannot reach a clinic cannot receive care, regardless of provider availability, insurance coverage, or treatment efficacy. Transportation functions as the foundational infrastructure beneath all other rural health interventions: telehealth equipment sits unused when patients cannot reach initial assessments, care coordination fails when follow-up appointments are missed, and chronic disease management collapses when medication refills remain 30 miles away.\nThe scope of the problem resists easy solutions. Approximately 3.6 million Americans miss or delay medical care annually due to transportation barriers, with disproportionate impact on rural residents, elderly populations, and those with chronic conditions requiring repeated visits. Dialysis patients needing three weekly trips, cancer patients requiring daily radiation treatments, and pregnant women needing regular prenatal visits face transportation burdens that accumulate into gaps in care with measurable health consequences.\nRHTP applications recognize transportation as a barrier but struggle to address it comprehensively. Most states include telehealth expansion as a partial transportation substitute, mobile health unit investments to bring care to patients, and enhanced coordination with existing non-emergency medical transportation systems. Fewer states propose the infrastructure investments, coordination mechanisms, or sustainable funding streams that would fundamentally address rural mobility.\nThe challenge is structural. Transportation crosses agency boundaries, funding streams, and professional domains. State health departments have no authority over roads, transit systems, or vehicle fleets. Medicaid’s non-emergency medical transportation benefit funds trips to medical appointments but not the grocery runs, pharmacy visits, and social engagements that also affect health. Volunteer driver programs fill gaps but face declining volunteer pools as rural populations age. No single entity owns the transportation problem, and RHTP’s five-year timeline cannot build transportation infrastructure that takes decades to establish.\nThis article examines what evidence exists for transportation interventions in rural health, how states propose using RHTP to address mobility barriers, and whether these approaches can realistically improve transportation access within program timelines. The honest assessment: transportation is among the most important and least solvable problems RHTP confronts.\nThe Rural Context The Transit Desert Rural America operates without the public transportation infrastructure urban residents assume. Approximately 16% of rural counties have no public transit service of any kind, and many more offer only token service inadequate for healthcare access. The 2025 Rural Transit Fact Book documents that 84% of counties have some level of rural transit service, but this figure obscures dramatic variation in service adequacy. A county with a twice-weekly demand-response van that must be scheduled 48 hours in advance has “transit service” but not meaningful healthcare transportation.\nWhere rural transit exists, it operates under constraints that limit utility. Limited hours of operation exclude evening and weekend medical appointments. Fixed routes (rare in rural areas) cannot serve dispersed populations. Demand-response services require advance scheduling incompatible with acute care needs. Geographic coverage excludes residents in outlying areas. The result: transit exists in theory but fails to function for many who need it most.\nFrontier counties face particular challenges. In areas where population density falls below six persons per square mile, traditional transit models become mathematically impossible. The average distance between residents exceeds what fixed routes can efficiently cover. Demand-response services spend most of their time traveling between pickups rather than transporting passengers. Cost per trip escalates to levels that strain agency budgets.\nPersonal Vehicle Dependence The rural transportation system is, for most residents, a personal automobile. Over 90% of rural households own at least one vehicle, and most rural trips occur via private car. This near-universal vehicle dependence shapes community design, service location, and health access assumptions.\nThe dependence creates vulnerability when personal transportation fails. Older adults who can no longer drive safely lose access to healthcare, groceries, social interaction, and independence simultaneously. Research indicates that men outlive their driving ability by an average of 10 years and women by 6 years, creating extended periods of transportation dependence that rural communities are poorly equipped to address.\nVehicle ownership costs strain low-income rural households. The American Automobile Association estimates annual vehicle ownership costs exceeding $12,000, including fuel, insurance, maintenance, and depreciation. For households earning $25,000 annually, transportation may consume nearly half of income. Households that cannot afford vehicle ownership or maintenance face transportation poverty in regions where no alternatives exist.\nWho Lacks Transportation Transportation barriers concentrate among populations with the greatest healthcare needs:\nElderly residents who no longer drive represent the fastest-growing transportation-dependent population. As rural areas age, the number of residents who cannot transport themselves to medical care increases while the informal networks of family and neighbors who previously provided rides thin. Adult children who moved away for employment cannot drive parents to appointments.\nPeople with disabilities face both physical accessibility barriers (vehicles that cannot accommodate wheelchairs, destinations without accessible entrances) and systemic barriers (transit schedules incompatible with treatment needs, drivers untrained in disability assistance).\nLow-income residents without reliable vehicles depend on vehicles that break down, lack adequate insurance, or cannot afford fuel for healthcare trips. Missing work to attend medical appointments compounds financial stress.\nPatients with intensive treatment needs face transportation burdens that multiply across frequent appointments. Dialysis patients requiring three weekly trips, chemotherapy patients with extended treatment courses, and rehabilitation patients needing ongoing therapy face cumulative transportation demands that exhaust resources.\nWeather and Seasonal Variation Rural transportation barriers intensify seasonally. Winter weather renders roads impassable, grounds air transport, and makes travel dangerous for elderly drivers. Mountain communities become isolated when passes close. Plains communities face blizzards that prevent any travel for days.\nSeasonal patterns interact with chronic disease management. Patients who skip appointments during winter months may arrive at spring visits with deteriorated conditions. Preventive care scheduled during difficult travel periods goes unattended. Emergency transport during severe weather faces extended response times that affect outcomes.\nEvidence Review Evidence Rating Table Intervention Evidence Quality Effect Size Rural Evidence Implementation Difficulty Medicaid NEMT (chronic disease) Moderate Moderate Yes Established Volunteer driver programs Limited Moderate Yes Moderate Mobile health units Moderate Access improvement Yes High Community paramedicine Limited Variable Yes High Rideshare partnerships Limited Small Urban only Low Telehealth as transport substitute Moderate Moderate Yes See 4C Treat-in-place models Emerging Unknown Yes Variable Transportation brokerage Moderate Process improvement Yes Established Non-Emergency Medical Transportation NEMT represents the most studied rural transportation intervention because Medicaid requires states to ensure transportation access for beneficiaries. Federal regulations mandate that state Medicaid programs provide NEMT for eligible members who have no other means of reaching covered healthcare services.\nEvidence demonstrates that NEMT improves appointment adherence. A 2022 systematic review and meta-analysis found that NEMT interventions show clear association with fewer missed clinic visits. A natural experiment examining transportation brokerage implementation in Georgia and Kentucky found that healthcare utilization improved and medical expenditures and hospital admissions decreased for diabetic adults receiving NEMT services.\nCost-effectiveness analyses consistently support NEMT investment. Research indicates that NEMT benefits are cost-effective or cost-saving for all 12 medical conditions analyzed, including prenatal care, asthma, heart disease, and diabetes. One study estimated that NEMT generates a positive return on investment exceeding $40 million per month per 30,000 Medicaid beneficiaries through reduced emergency utilization and improved chronic disease management.\nRural NEMT faces specific challenges. Trip distances in rural areas substantially exceed urban trips, increasing cost per service. A Delaware study found that mean cost per trip was significantly greater for rural users due to greater distance per trip. Over 50% of NEMT trips in rural areas serve dialysis patients, highlighting the concentration of need among chronic disease populations.\nBrokerage models that work in urban settings may fail rurally. Brokers optimize for efficiency by aggregating trips, but rural population dispersion makes aggregation difficult. Wait times extend. No-shows increase when rides arrive late. The broker model assumes a supply of transportation providers that may not exist in rural markets.\nMobile Health Units Mobile health clinics bring care to patients, inverting the transportation equation. Rather than moving patients to facilities, mobile units move facilities to patients. An estimated 2,000 mobile health clinics operate in the United States, providing approximately 6.5 million visits annually across preventive screenings, primary care, and dental services.\nEvidence supports mobile health units for specific functions. Studies demonstrate that mobile clinics identify and treat high rates of previously undiagnosed hypertension, diabetes, cancers, and hypercholesterolemia in underserved populations. Mobile units increase screening rates for populations who would not otherwise receive preventive care. Emergency department utilization decreases when mobile units provide accessible primary care.\nCost analyses show variable results. Startup costs for mobile health units range from $300,000 to over $2.5 million depending on equipment and configuration. Operating costs add ongoing expense. However, return on investment calculations show that mobile clinics can generate $23 in value for every $1 invested through avoided emergency department visits and early disease detection.\nRural mobile units face operational challenges. Vehicle maintenance in harsh conditions adds expense. Road conditions in rural areas accelerate wear. Seasonal weather limits service availability. Staff must travel with units, reducing time at patient care. Coverage areas are vast, requiring extensive driving between service locations.\nThe 2022 MOBILE Health Care Act allows federal funds allocated to community health centers in rural and underserved areas to establish mobile clinics, creating new funding pathways for RHTP integration.\nCommunity Paramedicine Community paramedicine and mobile integrated health programs leverage EMS personnel to provide non-emergency healthcare services in home and community settings. Over 40 states have implemented community paramedicine programs that deliver post-hospital follow-up care, preventive services, chronic disease management, and connections to community resources.\nEvidence for community paramedicine effectiveness is emerging. A randomized controlled trial in two rural Oregon counties found that community paramedicine reduced both urgent ED visits by 14% and avoidable ED visits by 40%. A 2020 study of rural community paramedicine reported nearly 60% fewer ED visits among patients with frequent emergency utilization, with average savings approaching $15,000 per patient.\nThe evidence base has limitations. A 2019 systematic review found limited data supporting improved outcomes after community paramedicine intervention, noting that most studies measure process outcomes rather than health outcomes. Study quality is generally low, with few randomized trials and short follow-up periods. Publication bias may inflate reported effects, as interventions failing to achieve positive outcomes are less likely to be published.\nRural implementation faces workforce constraints. Community paramedics require additional training beyond standard EMS certification. Rural EMS agencies already struggle to maintain adequate staffing for emergency response. Adding community paramedicine responsibilities may strain systems operating at capacity. However, community paramedicine can improve EMS sustainability by generating revenue during low-emergency-call periods.\nReimbursement remains the primary barrier. Medicare generally does not cover community paramedicine services. Medicaid coverage varies by state. Most programs rely on grant funding, health system subsidies, or pilot programs rather than sustainable payment mechanisms. Without stable reimbursement, community paramedicine programs cannot achieve scale.\nVolunteer Driver Programs Volunteer driver programs fill transportation gaps that formal services cannot address. The National Volunteer Transportation Center documents over 700 volunteer driver programs providing nearly 5 million one-way rides annually through approximately 55,000 volunteer drivers. Programs cover an estimated 60 million miles annually with volunteer driver hours valued at approximately $1.4 billion.\nCost-effectiveness comparisons favor volunteer models. Minnesota research found that volunteer drivers save transportation organizations between $75,000 and nearly $1.5 million annually compared to commercial alternatives. One program documented savings of $73 per round trip compared to NEMT busing and $185 per round trip compared to taxi services.\nVolunteer recruitment challenges threaten program sustainability. Most volunteer drivers are themselves elderly, with over half of volunteer drivers in surveyed programs aged 65 to 69. As these volunteers age out of driving, replacement recruitment has not kept pace with need. One Minnesota program reported volunteer numbers declining from 40 drivers in 2016 to 18 drivers in 2018, resulting in denial of two to six ride requests daily.\nRural volunteer programs face particular challenges. Distances traveled are longer, increasing volunteer burden. Reimbursement rates may not cover actual fuel costs. Liability concerns deter potential volunteers. Scheduling coordination is difficult with dispersed volunteers and patients. Programs depend on the goodwill of aging volunteers who may themselves require transportation assistance within years.\nRideshare and Technology Solutions Transportation network companies like Uber and Lyft have entered the medical transportation market, partnering with health systems and NEMT programs to provide on-demand rides. The appeal is significant: technology-enabled dispatch, real-time tracking, flexible availability, and lower cost than traditional NEMT.\nEvidence for rideshare effectiveness in medical transportation is limited and urban-focused. A 2020 Medicaid implementation study found that rideshare-based medical transportation maintained similar ride quality ratings to traditional NEMT but was associated with higher rates of late and failed pickups among heavy users. Quality concerns include driver screening adequacy, vehicle appropriateness for medical passengers, and safety for vulnerable populations.\nRural applicability is severely constrained. Rideshare companies concentrate drivers in dense markets where demand justifies participation. Rural areas often have no rideshare availability, making partnerships irrelevant regardless of evidence from urban implementations. The gig economy model that powers urban rideshare does not translate to regions where a driver might wait hours between ride requests.\nTechnology can improve coordination without requiring rideshare presence. Dispatch software, ride scheduling platforms, and trip coordination systems can enhance existing rural transportation resources. Several states propose RHTP investments in unified scheduling platforms that integrate NEMT, volunteer programs, and transit services through single points of access.\nTelehealth as Transportation Substitute Telehealth substitutes for some transportation by eliminating the need for travel. When effective, telehealth represents not reduced transportation burden but eliminated transportation burden. Article 4C examines telehealth evidence comprehensively; transportation implications receive summary treatment here.\nTelehealth cannot substitute for all in-person care. Physical examinations, procedures, laboratory draws, imaging, vaccinations, and many assessments require patient presence. Telehealth works as supplement rather than replacement, reducing rather than eliminating transportation needs.\nRural telehealth effectiveness depends on broadband availability that remains incomplete. RHTP applications often pair telehealth expansion with assumptions about broadband investment that may or may not materialize. Equipment provided to patients without adequate connectivity produces assets that cannot be used.\nCertain populations and conditions show strong telehealth transportation substitution potential. Behavioral health services, chronic disease monitoring, medication management, and follow-up consultations often work well via telehealth. These service categories constitute substantial portions of healthcare utilization, making partial transportation substitution meaningful even if complete substitution is impossible.\nDelivery Model Comparison Model Cost per Trip Availability Flexibility Rural Applicability Medicaid NEMT broker $30-60 Scheduled (48h advance) Low Established Volunteer driver program $10-25 Limited to volunteers High Good (if volunteers exist) Transit authority service Variable Schedule-dependent Low Limited Mobile health unit N/A Location-dependent High Good Community paramedicine $150-300 On-demand High Moderate Rideshare partnership $15-40 Immediate (if available) High Poor State Program Examples West Virginia: Rural Health Link West Virginia’s RHTP application proposes Rural Health Link, a unified medical transportation platform integrating NEMT, public transit, community programs, and volunteer networks through a single scheduling interface. The platform aims to coordinate transportation resources that currently operate independently, reducing gaps where patients fall between systems.\nThe approach recognizes that transportation resources exist but coordination fails. Medicaid NEMT, community transit, volunteer programs, and faith-based transportation each serve portions of the population without awareness of each other’s capacity or gaps. Unified scheduling could optimize available resources while identifying needs that no current program addresses.\nEstimated funding allocation of $20-28 million includes platform development, vehicle grants for capacity expansion, driver recruitment and training, and operations support. Subawardees include the Medicaid NEMT contractor, regional transit authorities, community action agencies, and technology vendors.\nIowa: EMS Community Care Mobile Iowa’s RHTP application emphasizes mobile integrated healthcare bringing care to communities rather than transporting patients to facilities. The EMS Community Care Mobile initiative focuses on high-risk maternal transport telehealth for mothers and newborns requiring higher levels of care, mobile integrated healthcare delivering prenatal, postpartum, and chronic disease management to homes and community sites, and post-surgery discharge support through mobile teams.\nThe model acknowledges that traditional facility-based care fails populations facing transportation barriers. Rather than investing exclusively in transportation systems to move patients, Iowa invests in care delivery systems that reach patients where they are.\nMaine: Volunteer and Community Models Maine has invested in volunteer driver programs through initiatives like the Community Care program that coordinate volunteer transportation across rural regions. The state’s geography, with dispersed coastal and inland populations, makes traditional transit impractical for much of the state.\nVolunteer recruitment remains the binding constraint. Even well-designed programs cannot operate without sufficient volunteers, and Maine’s aging population creates simultaneous increase in ride demand and decrease in volunteer availability.\nRHTP Application Assessment Prevalence of Transportation Initiatives Transportation appears in RHTP applications primarily through indirect mechanisms rather than dedicated transportation investments:\nTelehealth expansion appears in every state application as partial transportation substitute. States position telehealth as addressing transportation barriers by reducing the need for facility visits. This framing is accurate but incomplete; telehealth supplements rather than replaces in-person care.\nMobile health unit investments appear in approximately one-third of applications. States propose new mobile units, enhanced equipment for existing units, or coordination mechanisms for mobile services. Mobile units bring care to patients rather than moving patients to care.\nNEMT enhancement proposals appear primarily in applications from states seeking to coordinate existing Medicaid transportation with RHTP initiatives. Few states propose substantial new NEMT investment, likely because NEMT is funded through Medicaid rather than RHTP.\nVolunteer program support appears in some applications as workforce or community health worker initiatives. Few applications focus specifically on volunteer driver recruitment, training, or coordination.\nTreat-in-place models including community paramedicine and mobile integrated health appear in applications from states with existing EMS infrastructure to leverage. These models address transportation by eliminating the need for emergency department transport for conditions manageable in the field.\nWhat Applications Miss Infrastructure investment in roads, vehicles, and transportation systems falls outside RHTP scope. States cannot use RHTP funding to pave rural roads, purchase transit vehicles, or establish bus routes. The transformation program can coordinate transportation resources but cannot create transportation infrastructure.\nCoordination mechanism sustainability receives insufficient attention. Platforms that coordinate transportation during RHTP funding may lose support when funding ends. Unless states build sustainable financing for coordination functions, investments in scheduling technology and integration produce temporary rather than permanent improvement.\nWorkforce implications of volunteer driver shortage receive little recognition. Applications that depend on volunteer transportation assume volunteer availability that may not exist by 2030 as current volunteers age out.\nPopulation-specific needs for specialty transportation often go unaddressed. Wheelchair accessibility, bariatric capacity, pediatric accommodations, and behavioral health transport require specialized vehicles and training that general transportation initiatives may not provide.\nImplementation Reality What Works Coordination over construction represents the achievable RHTP transportation strategy. States cannot build transit systems in five years, but they can coordinate existing resources more effectively. Unified scheduling platforms, shared dispatch systems, and coordinated trip planning can extract more value from existing transportation assets.\nTargeted population focus produces measurable results. Rather than attempting to solve rural transportation comprehensively, successful programs focus on populations with intensive needs: dialysis patients, cancer patients, pregnant women requiring prenatal care. Concentrated investment produces larger per-patient impact than diffuse efforts.\nMobile and treat-in-place models address transportation by eliminating its necessity. Every condition managed through telehealth, mobile unit visit, or community paramedicine response is a trip that did not need to occur. Reframing transportation as a problem to eliminate rather than a system to build opens alternative intervention pathways.\nWhat Fails Programs dependent on resources that do not exist cannot succeed. Volunteer driver programs in communities without volunteers, rideshare partnerships in areas without rideshare drivers, and coordination platforms connecting services that have not been established all fail at the resource level rather than the design level.\nTechnology without underlying service wastes investment. Scheduling platforms are useful only if services exist to schedule. Data systems that document unmet need without capacity to address need produce documentation rather than transportation.\nShort-term funding for long-term problems creates unsustainable programs. Transportation infrastructure requires decades to build and permanent funding to maintain. RHTP’s five-year timeline can launch pilots and demonstrate models but cannot establish permanent systems.\nThe 2030 Question Sustainability Assessment Transportation presents among the most difficult RHTP sustainability challenges. Healthcare organizations cannot operate transportation systems at scale. Transit agencies lack healthcare expertise. Medicaid NEMT is a benefit rather than an infrastructure program. No entity is positioned to assume permanent responsibility for rural health transportation.\nMobile health infrastructure may persist if healthcare systems find operational value. Units purchased with RHTP funding become health system assets. Ongoing operation requires sustainable revenue, likely through fee-for-service billing supplemented by operational subsidies.\nCoordination platforms require modest ongoing funding but also ongoing management. States that build transportation scheduling systems must identify permanent homes for platform operation. Technology requires maintenance, updates, and staffing.\nCommunity paramedicine depends on reimbursement policy evolution. If Medicare and Medicaid establish payment for community paramedicine services by 2030, programs can sustain on service revenue. If payment policy does not evolve, programs collapse when grant funding ends.\nVolunteer programs face demographic headwinds regardless of RHTP. The volunteer driver shortage will intensify as rural populations age. RHTP might temporarily boost recruitment, but underlying demographic trends continue.\nRealistic Expectations RHTP can improve rural transportation at the margins. Coordination will extract more value from existing resources. Mobile services will reach some patients who could not otherwise receive care. Community paramedicine will divert some emergency transports. Telehealth will eliminate some trips.\nRHTP cannot solve rural transportation. The problem is too large, too infrastructural, and too far outside healthcare’s scope for a healthcare transformation program to address fundamentally. States that position RHTP transportation investments as comprehensive solutions set expectations that cannot be met.\nThe honest framing: transportation is a problem that healthcare must work around rather than a problem healthcare can solve. RHTP investments should maximize workarounds while acknowledging that the underlying challenge will persist.\nConclusion Transportation functions as the invisible infrastructure beneath all rural health services. Patients who cannot reach care cannot receive care, regardless of provider availability, insurance coverage, or treatment quality. This foundational role makes transportation among the most important factors in rural health outcomes.\nRHTP cannot build transportation systems. The program can coordinate existing resources, fund mobile alternatives, support community paramedicine, and enhance telehealth as a transportation substitute. These interventions help at the margins without addressing the fundamental challenge of rural mobility.\nEvidence supports investment in NEMT enhancement, mobile health units, and community paramedicine, with varying strength and rural applicability. Volunteer driver programs provide cost-effective service but face sustainability challenges as volunteer pools shrink. Rideshare partnerships offer little rural value given driver unavailability.\nStates implementing RHTP transportation initiatives should pursue coordination over construction, target populations with intensive needs, and build sustainability mechanisms into program design from inception. Mobile and treat-in-place models offer the most promising pathway by eliminating transportation need rather than attempting to meet it.\nThe fundamental reality: rural transportation is a generational infrastructure challenge that healthcare transformation programs cannot solve. RHTP investments should maximize achievable improvements while maintaining honest assessment of what five years of grant funding can and cannot accomplish against problems decades in the making.\nCross-References Related Series 1 Foundation Articles\n1H: Transportation and Mobility (baseline rural transportation context) Related Series 2 Federal Policy Architecture\n2B: Medicaid Architecture and the $911B Question (NEMT benefit structure) 2H: The 2030 Cliff (transportation program sustainability) Related Series 4 Transformation Approaches\n4C: Telehealth and Virtual Care (transportation substitution potential) 4H: Social Needs Integration (transportation as SDOH) 4K: Emergency and Trauma Systems (emergency medical transport) 4A: Aging in Place (elderly transportation needs) 4D: Community Health Workers (CHW transportation navigation) Series 3 State Profiles with Notable Transportation Initiatives\n3.WV: West Virginia (Rural Health Link platform) 3.IA: Iowa (EMS Community Care Mobile) 3.ME: Maine (Community Care volunteer model) 3.MT: Montana (frontier NEMT challenges) Sources Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. “Social Determinants of Health: Transportation Insecurity.” AHRQ, 2024, ahrq.gov/sdoh/data-analytics/transportation.html.\nBureau of Transportation Statistics. “85% of Rural Residents Have Reasonable Access to Intercity Transportation; Lack of Reasonable Access Falls Disproportionately on Low-Income Households.” BTS Data Spotlight, 2022, bts.gov/data-spotlight.\nCenter for Health Care Strategies. “Making a Case for Community Paramedicine: Evidence Roundup.” CHCS, Dec. 2024, chcs.org/resource/making-case-community-paramedicine.\nCenter for Health Care Strategies. “Leveraging Community Paramedicine to Address Rural Health Needs.” CHCS, Oct. 2025, chcs.org/resource/leveraging-community-paramedicine.\nFlex Monitoring Team. “The Evidence for Community Paramedicine in Rural Areas: State and Local Findings and the Role of the State Flex Program.” University of Minnesota Rural Health Research Center, 2014.\nGregg, Abbey, et al. “Systematic Review of Community Paramedicine and EMS Mobile Integrated Health Care Interventions in the United States.” Population Health Management, vol. 22, no. 3, June 2019, pp. 213-222.\nIowa Department of Health and Human Services. “Rural Health Transformation Program Application.” Iowa HHS, 2025.\nMedical Transportation Access Coalition. “NEMT Bibliography: Research on Non-Emergency Medical Transportation.” MTAC, June 2024, mtaccoalition.org.\nMilliman. “The Road to Care: An Analysis of Non-Emergency Medical Transportation Delivery Systems.” Milliman Research Report, 2025.\nNational Aging and Disability Transportation Center. “Volunteer Transportation Resources.” NADTC, 2024, nadtc.org/volunteer-transportation.\nNational Rural Health Association. “Bridging the Gap: A Policy Framework for Sustainable Community Paramedicine in Rural America.” NRHA Policy Brief, Dec. 2024.\nRural Health Information Hub. “Community Paramedicine Overview.” RHIhub, 2025, ruralhealthinfo.org/topics/community-paramedicine.\nRural Health Information Hub. “Volunteer Models for Rural Transportation.” RHIhub Transportation Toolkit, 2024, ruralhealthinfo.org/toolkits/transportation.\nRural Policy Research Institute. “Transit for Healthcare: Volunteer Drivers in Aging Rural Minnesota.” Center for Rural Policy and Development, Sept. 2020.\nSmall Urban and Rural Transit Center. “Rural Transit Fact Book 2025.” North Dakota State University Upper Great Plains Transportation Institute, June 2025.\nSolomon, E., et al. “Impact of Transportation Interventions on Health Care Outcomes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.” Medical Care, vol. 58, no. 4, 2020, pp. 384-391.\nThomas, L.V., and K.R.

<p><em>What moves people when transit doesn&rsquo;t exist?</em></p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#introduction">#</a></h2>
<p>Distance is destiny in rural healthcare. A patient who cannot reach a clinic cannot receive care, regardless of provider availability, insurance coverage, or treatment efficacy. Transportation functions as the foundational infrastructure beneath all other rural health interventions: telehealth equipment sits unused when patients cannot reach initial assessments, care coordination fails when follow-up appointments are missed, and chronic disease management collapses when medication refills remain 30 miles away.</p>
<p>The scope of the problem resists easy solutions. <strong>Approximately 3.6 million Americans miss or delay medical care annually due to transportation barriers</strong>, with disproportionate impact on rural residents, elderly populations, and those with chronic conditions requiring repeated visits. Dialysis patients needing three weekly trips, cancer patients requiring daily radiation treatments, and pregnant women needing regular prenatal visits face transportation burdens that accumulate into gaps in care with measurable health consequences.</p>
<p>RHTP applications recognize transportation as a barrier but struggle to address it comprehensively. Most states include telehealth expansion as a partial transportation substitute, mobile health unit investments to bring care to patients, and enhanced coordination with existing non-emergency medical transportation systems. <strong>Fewer states propose the infrastructure investments, coordination mechanisms, or sustainable funding streams</strong> that would fundamentally address rural mobility.</p>
<p>The challenge is structural. Transportation crosses agency boundaries, funding streams, and professional domains. State health departments have no authority over roads, transit systems, or vehicle fleets. Medicaid&rsquo;s non-emergency medical transportation benefit funds trips to medical appointments but not the grocery runs, pharmacy visits, and social engagements that also affect health. Volunteer driver programs fill gaps but face declining volunteer pools as rural populations age. <strong>No single entity owns the transportation problem</strong>, and RHTP&rsquo;s five-year timeline cannot build transportation infrastructure that takes decades to establish.</p>
<p>This article examines what evidence exists for transportation interventions in rural health, how states propose using RHTP to address mobility barriers, and whether these approaches can realistically improve transportation access within program timelines. The honest assessment: transportation is among the most important and least solvable problems RHTP confronts.</p>
<h2 id="the-rural-context">The Rural Context<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-rural-context">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="the-transit-desert">The Transit Desert<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-transit-desert">#</a></h3>
<p>Rural America operates without the public transportation infrastructure urban residents assume. <strong>Approximately 16% of rural counties have no public transit service of any kind</strong>, and many more offer only token service inadequate for healthcare access. The 2025 Rural Transit Fact Book documents that 84% of counties have some level of rural transit service, but this figure obscures dramatic variation in service adequacy. A county with a twice-weekly demand-response van that must be scheduled 48 hours in advance has &ldquo;transit service&rdquo; but not meaningful healthcare transportation.</p>
<p>Where rural transit exists, it operates under constraints that limit utility. Limited hours of operation exclude evening and weekend medical appointments. Fixed routes (rare in rural areas) cannot serve dispersed populations. Demand-response services require advance scheduling incompatible with acute care needs. Geographic coverage excludes residents in outlying areas. The result: transit exists in theory but fails to function for many who need it most.</p>
<p><strong>Frontier counties face particular challenges.</strong> In areas where population density falls below six persons per square mile, traditional transit models become mathematically impossible. The average distance between residents exceeds what fixed routes can efficiently cover. Demand-response services spend most of their time traveling between pickups rather than transporting passengers. Cost per trip escalates to levels that strain agency budgets.</p>
<h3 id="personal-vehicle-dependence">Personal Vehicle Dependence<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#personal-vehicle-dependence">#</a></h3>
<p>The rural transportation system is, for most residents, a personal automobile. <strong>Over 90% of rural households own at least one vehicle</strong>, and most rural trips occur via private car. This near-universal vehicle dependence shapes community design, service location, and health access assumptions.</p>
<p>The dependence creates vulnerability when personal transportation fails. Older adults who can no longer drive safely lose access to healthcare, groceries, social interaction, and independence simultaneously. Research indicates that <strong>men outlive their driving ability by an average of 10 years and women by 6 years</strong>, creating extended periods of transportation dependence that rural communities are poorly equipped to address.</p>
<p>Vehicle ownership costs strain low-income rural households. The American Automobile Association estimates annual vehicle ownership costs exceeding <strong>$12,000</strong>, including fuel, insurance, maintenance, and depreciation. For households earning $25,000 annually, transportation may consume nearly half of income. Households that cannot afford vehicle ownership or maintenance face transportation poverty in regions where no alternatives exist.</p>
<h3 id="who-lacks-transportation">Who Lacks Transportation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#who-lacks-transportation">#</a></h3>
<p>Transportation barriers concentrate among populations with the greatest healthcare needs:</p>
<p><strong>Elderly residents who no longer drive</strong> represent the fastest-growing transportation-dependent population. As rural areas age, the number of residents who cannot transport themselves to medical care increases while the informal networks of family and neighbors who previously provided rides thin. Adult children who moved away for employment cannot drive parents to appointments.</p>
<p><strong>People with disabilities</strong> face both physical accessibility barriers (vehicles that cannot accommodate wheelchairs, destinations without accessible entrances) and systemic barriers (transit schedules incompatible with treatment needs, drivers untrained in disability assistance).</p>
<p><strong>Low-income residents without reliable vehicles</strong> depend on vehicles that break down, lack adequate insurance, or cannot afford fuel for healthcare trips. Missing work to attend medical appointments compounds financial stress.</p>
<p><strong>Patients with intensive treatment needs</strong> face transportation burdens that multiply across frequent appointments. Dialysis patients requiring three weekly trips, chemotherapy patients with extended treatment courses, and rehabilitation patients needing ongoing therapy face cumulative transportation demands that exhaust resources.</p>
<h3 id="weather-and-seasonal-variation">Weather and Seasonal Variation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#weather-and-seasonal-variation">#</a></h3>
<p>Rural transportation barriers intensify seasonally. Winter weather renders roads impassable, grounds air transport, and makes travel dangerous for elderly drivers. Mountain communities become isolated when passes close. Plains communities face blizzards that prevent any travel for days.</p>
<p><strong>Seasonal patterns interact with chronic disease management.</strong> Patients who skip appointments during winter months may arrive at spring visits with deteriorated conditions. Preventive care scheduled during difficult travel periods goes unattended. Emergency transport during severe weather faces extended response times that affect outcomes.</p>

<h3 id="non-emergency-medical-transportation">Non-Emergency Medical Transportation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#non-emergency-medical-transportation">#</a></h3>
<p>NEMT represents the most studied rural transportation intervention because Medicaid requires states to ensure transportation access for beneficiaries. Federal regulations mandate that state Medicaid programs provide NEMT for eligible members who have no other means of reaching covered healthcare services.</p>
<p><strong>Evidence demonstrates that NEMT improves appointment adherence.</strong> A 2022 systematic review and meta-analysis found that NEMT interventions show clear association with fewer missed clinic visits. A natural experiment examining transportation brokerage implementation in Georgia and Kentucky found that healthcare utilization improved and medical expenditures and hospital admissions decreased for diabetic adults receiving NEMT services.</p>
<p>Cost-effectiveness analyses consistently support NEMT investment. Research indicates that <strong>NEMT benefits are cost-effective or cost-saving for all 12 medical conditions analyzed</strong>, including prenatal care, asthma, heart disease, and diabetes. One study estimated that NEMT generates a positive return on investment exceeding <strong>$40 million per month per 30,000 Medicaid beneficiaries</strong> through reduced emergency utilization and improved chronic disease management.</p>
<p><strong>Rural NEMT faces specific challenges.</strong> Trip distances in rural areas substantially exceed urban trips, increasing cost per service. A Delaware study found that mean cost per trip was <strong>significantly greater for rural users</strong> due to greater distance per trip. Over 50% of NEMT trips in rural areas serve dialysis patients, highlighting the concentration of need among chronic disease populations.</p>
<p>Brokerage models that work in urban settings may fail rurally. Brokers optimize for efficiency by aggregating trips, but rural population dispersion makes aggregation difficult. Wait times extend. No-shows increase when rides arrive late. The broker model assumes a supply of transportation providers that may not exist in rural markets.</p>
<h3 id="mobile-health-units">Mobile Health Units<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#mobile-health-units">#</a></h3>
<p>Mobile health clinics bring care to patients, inverting the transportation equation. Rather than moving patients to facilities, mobile units move facilities to patients. An estimated 2,000 mobile health clinics operate in the United States, providing approximately <strong>6.5 million visits annually</strong> across preventive screenings, primary care, and dental services.</p>
<p>Evidence supports mobile health units for specific functions. Studies demonstrate that mobile clinics <strong>identify and treat high rates of previously undiagnosed hypertension, diabetes, cancers, and hypercholesterolemia</strong> in underserved populations. Mobile units increase screening rates for populations who would not otherwise receive preventive care. Emergency department utilization decreases when mobile units provide accessible primary care.</p>
<p><strong>Cost analyses show variable results.</strong> Startup costs for mobile health units range from $300,000 to over $2.5 million depending on equipment and configuration. Operating costs add ongoing expense. However, return on investment calculations show that mobile clinics can generate <strong>$23 in value for every $1 invested</strong> through avoided emergency department visits and early disease detection.</p>
<p>Rural mobile units face operational challenges. Vehicle maintenance in harsh conditions adds expense. Road conditions in rural areas accelerate wear. Seasonal weather limits service availability. Staff must travel with units, reducing time at patient care. Coverage areas are vast, requiring extensive driving between service locations.</p>
<p>The 2022 MOBILE Health Care Act allows federal funds allocated to community health centers in rural and underserved areas to establish mobile clinics, creating new funding pathways for RHTP integration.</p>
<h3 id="community-paramedicine">Community Paramedicine<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#community-paramedicine">#</a></h3>
<p>Community paramedicine and mobile integrated health programs leverage EMS personnel to provide non-emergency healthcare services in home and community settings. Over 40 states have implemented community paramedicine programs that <strong>deliver post-hospital follow-up care, preventive services, chronic disease management, and connections to community resources</strong>.</p>
<p>Evidence for community paramedicine effectiveness is emerging. A randomized controlled trial in two rural Oregon counties found that community paramedicine reduced both <strong>urgent ED visits by 14% and avoidable ED visits by 40%</strong>. A 2020 study of rural community paramedicine reported nearly 60% fewer ED visits among patients with frequent emergency utilization, with average savings approaching $15,000 per patient.</p>
<p><strong>The evidence base has limitations.</strong> A 2019 systematic review found limited data supporting improved outcomes after community paramedicine intervention, noting that most studies measure process outcomes rather than health outcomes. Study quality is generally low, with few randomized trials and short follow-up periods. Publication bias may inflate reported effects, as interventions failing to achieve positive outcomes are less likely to be published.</p>
<p>Rural implementation faces workforce constraints. Community paramedics require additional training beyond standard EMS certification. Rural EMS agencies already struggle to maintain adequate staffing for emergency response. Adding community paramedicine responsibilities may strain systems operating at capacity. However, community paramedicine can improve EMS sustainability by generating revenue during low-emergency-call periods.</p>
<p>Reimbursement remains the primary barrier. Medicare generally does not cover community paramedicine services. Medicaid coverage varies by state. Most programs rely on grant funding, health system subsidies, or pilot programs rather than sustainable payment mechanisms. <strong>Without stable reimbursement, community paramedicine programs cannot achieve scale.</strong></p>
<h3 id="volunteer-driver-programs">Volunteer Driver Programs<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#volunteer-driver-programs">#</a></h3>
<p>Volunteer driver programs fill transportation gaps that formal services cannot address. The National Volunteer Transportation Center documents over <strong>700 volunteer driver programs providing nearly 5 million one-way rides annually</strong> through approximately 55,000 volunteer drivers. Programs cover an estimated 60 million miles annually with volunteer driver hours valued at approximately $1.4 billion.</p>
<p>Cost-effectiveness comparisons favor volunteer models. Minnesota research found that volunteer drivers save transportation organizations between <strong>$75,000 and nearly $1.5 million annually</strong> compared to commercial alternatives. One program documented savings of $73 per round trip compared to NEMT busing and $185 per round trip compared to taxi services.</p>
<p><strong>Volunteer recruitment challenges threaten program sustainability.</strong> Most volunteer drivers are themselves elderly, with over half of volunteer drivers in surveyed programs aged 65 to 69. As these volunteers age out of driving, replacement recruitment has not kept pace with need. One Minnesota program reported volunteer numbers declining from 40 drivers in 2016 to 18 drivers in 2018, resulting in denial of two to six ride requests daily.</p>
<p>Rural volunteer programs face particular challenges. Distances traveled are longer, increasing volunteer burden. Reimbursement rates may not cover actual fuel costs. Liability concerns deter potential volunteers. Scheduling coordination is difficult with dispersed volunteers and patients. Programs depend on the goodwill of aging volunteers who may themselves require transportation assistance within years.</p>
<h3 id="rideshare-and-technology-solutions">Rideshare and Technology Solutions<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#rideshare-and-technology-solutions">#</a></h3>
<p>Transportation network companies like Uber and Lyft have entered the medical transportation market, partnering with health systems and NEMT programs to provide on-demand rides. The appeal is significant: technology-enabled dispatch, real-time tracking, flexible availability, and lower cost than traditional NEMT.</p>
<p><strong>Evidence for rideshare effectiveness in medical transportation is limited and urban-focused.</strong> A 2020 Medicaid implementation study found that rideshare-based medical transportation maintained similar ride quality ratings to traditional NEMT but was associated with <strong>higher rates of late and failed pickups</strong> among heavy users. Quality concerns include driver screening adequacy, vehicle appropriateness for medical passengers, and safety for vulnerable populations.</p>
<p>Rural applicability is severely constrained. Rideshare companies concentrate drivers in dense markets where demand justifies participation. Rural areas often have <strong>no rideshare availability</strong>, making partnerships irrelevant regardless of evidence from urban implementations. The gig economy model that powers urban rideshare does not translate to regions where a driver might wait hours between ride requests.</p>
<p>Technology can improve coordination without requiring rideshare presence. Dispatch software, ride scheduling platforms, and trip coordination systems can enhance existing rural transportation resources. Several states propose RHTP investments in unified scheduling platforms that integrate NEMT, volunteer programs, and transit services through single points of access.</p>
<h3 id="telehealth-as-transportation-substitute">Telehealth as Transportation Substitute<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#telehealth-as-transportation-substitute">#</a></h3>
<p>Telehealth substitutes for some transportation by eliminating the need for travel. When effective, telehealth represents not reduced transportation burden but eliminated transportation burden. Article 4C examines telehealth evidence comprehensively; transportation implications receive summary treatment here.</p>
<p><strong>Telehealth cannot substitute for all in-person care.</strong> Physical examinations, procedures, laboratory draws, imaging, vaccinations, and many assessments require patient presence. Telehealth works as supplement rather than replacement, reducing rather than eliminating transportation needs.</p>
<p>Rural telehealth effectiveness depends on broadband availability that remains incomplete. RHTP applications often pair telehealth expansion with assumptions about broadband investment that may or may not materialize. Equipment provided to patients without adequate connectivity produces assets that cannot be used.</p>
<p>Certain populations and conditions show strong telehealth transportation substitution potential. Behavioral health services, chronic disease monitoring, medication management, and follow-up consultations often work well via telehealth. These service categories constitute substantial portions of healthcare utilization, making partial transportation substitution meaningful even if complete substitution is impossible.</p>

<h3 id="west-virginia-rural-health-link">West Virginia: Rural Health Link<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#west-virginia-rural-health-link">#</a></h3>
<p>West Virginia&rsquo;s RHTP application proposes <strong>Rural Health Link</strong>, a unified medical transportation platform integrating NEMT, public transit, community programs, and volunteer networks through a single scheduling interface. The platform aims to coordinate transportation resources that currently operate independently, reducing gaps where patients fall between systems.</p>
<p>The approach recognizes that transportation resources exist but coordination fails. Medicaid NEMT, community transit, volunteer programs, and faith-based transportation each serve portions of the population without awareness of each other&rsquo;s capacity or gaps. Unified scheduling could optimize available resources while identifying needs that no current program addresses.</p>
<p><strong>Estimated funding allocation of $20-28 million</strong> includes platform development, vehicle grants for capacity expansion, driver recruitment and training, and operations support. Subawardees include the Medicaid NEMT contractor, regional transit authorities, community action agencies, and technology vendors.</p>
<h3 id="iowa-ems-community-care-mobile">Iowa: EMS Community Care Mobile<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#iowa-ems-community-care-mobile">#</a></h3>
<p>Iowa&rsquo;s RHTP application emphasizes mobile integrated healthcare bringing care to communities rather than transporting patients to facilities. The <strong>EMS Community Care Mobile</strong> initiative focuses on high-risk maternal transport telehealth for mothers and newborns requiring higher levels of care, mobile integrated healthcare delivering prenatal, postpartum, and chronic disease management to homes and community sites, and post-surgery discharge support through mobile teams.</p>
<p>The model acknowledges that traditional facility-based care fails populations facing transportation barriers. Rather than investing exclusively in transportation systems to move patients, Iowa invests in care delivery systems that reach patients where they are.</p>
<h3 id="maine-volunteer-and-community-models">Maine: Volunteer and Community Models<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#maine-volunteer-and-community-models">#</a></h3>
<p>Maine has invested in volunteer driver programs through initiatives like the <strong>Community Care program</strong> that coordinate volunteer transportation across rural regions. The state&rsquo;s geography, with dispersed coastal and inland populations, makes traditional transit impractical for much of the state.</p>
<p>Volunteer recruitment remains the binding constraint. Even well-designed programs cannot operate without sufficient volunteers, and Maine&rsquo;s aging population creates simultaneous increase in ride demand and decrease in volunteer availability.</p>

<h3 id="prevalence-of-transportation-initiatives">Prevalence of Transportation Initiatives<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#prevalence-of-transportation-initiatives">#</a></h3>
<p>Transportation appears in RHTP applications primarily through indirect mechanisms rather than dedicated transportation investments:</p>
<p><strong>Telehealth expansion</strong> appears in every state application as partial transportation substitute. States position telehealth as addressing transportation barriers by reducing the need for facility visits. This framing is accurate but incomplete; telehealth supplements rather than replaces in-person care.</p>
<p><strong>Mobile health unit investments</strong> appear in approximately one-third of applications. States propose new mobile units, enhanced equipment for existing units, or coordination mechanisms for mobile services. Mobile units bring care to patients rather than moving patients to care.</p>
<p><strong>NEMT enhancement</strong> proposals appear primarily in applications from states seeking to coordinate existing Medicaid transportation with RHTP initiatives. Few states propose substantial new NEMT investment, likely because NEMT is funded through Medicaid rather than RHTP.</p>
<p><strong>Volunteer program support</strong> appears in some applications as workforce or community health worker initiatives. Few applications focus specifically on volunteer driver recruitment, training, or coordination.</p>
<p><strong>Treat-in-place models</strong> including community paramedicine and mobile integrated health appear in applications from states with existing EMS infrastructure to leverage. These models address transportation by eliminating the need for emergency department transport for conditions manageable in the field.</p>
<h3 id="what-applications-miss">What Applications Miss<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-applications-miss">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Infrastructure investment</strong> in roads, vehicles, and transportation systems falls outside RHTP scope. States cannot use RHTP funding to pave rural roads, purchase transit vehicles, or establish bus routes. The transformation program can coordinate transportation resources but cannot create transportation infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>Coordination mechanism sustainability</strong> receives insufficient attention. Platforms that coordinate transportation during RHTP funding may lose support when funding ends. Unless states build sustainable financing for coordination functions, investments in scheduling technology and integration produce temporary rather than permanent improvement.</p>
<p><strong>Workforce implications</strong> of volunteer driver shortage receive little recognition. Applications that depend on volunteer transportation assume volunteer availability that may not exist by 2030 as current volunteers age out.</p>
<p><strong>Population-specific needs</strong> for specialty transportation often go unaddressed. Wheelchair accessibility, bariatric capacity, pediatric accommodations, and behavioral health transport require specialized vehicles and training that general transportation initiatives may not provide.</p>

<p><strong>Coordination over construction</strong> represents the achievable RHTP transportation strategy.

Unified scheduling platforms, shared dispatch systems, and coordinated trip planning can extract more value from existing transportation assets.</p>
<p><strong>Targeted population focus</strong> produces measurable results. Rather than attempting to solve rural transportation comprehensively, successful programs focus on populations with intensive needs: dialysis patients, cancer patients, pregnant women requiring prenatal care. Concentrated investment produces larger per-patient impact than diffuse efforts.</p>
<p><strong>Mobile and treat-in-place models</strong> address transportation by eliminating its necessity. Every condition managed through telehealth, mobile unit visit, or community paramedicine response is a trip that did not need to occur. Reframing transportation as a problem to eliminate rather than a system to build opens alternative intervention pathways.</p>
<h3 id="what-fails">What Fails<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-fails">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Programs dependent on resources that do not exist</strong> cannot succeed. Volunteer driver programs in communities without volunteers, rideshare partnerships in areas without rideshare drivers, and coordination platforms connecting services that have not been established all fail at the resource level rather than the design level.</p>
<p><strong>Technology without underlying service</strong> wastes investment. Scheduling platforms are useful only if services exist to schedule. Data systems that document unmet need without capacity to address need produce documentation rather than transportation.</p>
<p><strong>Short-term funding for long-term problems</strong> creates unsustainable programs. Transportation infrastructure requires decades to build and permanent funding to maintain. RHTP&rsquo;s five-year timeline can launch pilots and demonstrate models but cannot establish permanent systems.</p>
<h2 id="the-2030-question">The 2030 Question<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-2030-question">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="sustainability-assessment">Sustainability Assessment<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#sustainability-assessment">#</a></h3>
<p>Transportation presents among the most difficult RHTP sustainability challenges. Healthcare organizations cannot operate transportation systems at scale. Transit agencies lack healthcare expertise. Medicaid NEMT is a benefit rather than an infrastructure program. <strong>No entity is positioned to assume permanent responsibility for rural health transportation.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mobile health infrastructure</strong> may persist if healthcare systems find operational value. Units purchased with RHTP funding become health system assets. Ongoing operation requires sustainable revenue, likely through fee-for-service billing supplemented by operational subsidies.</p>
<p><strong>Coordination platforms</strong> require modest ongoing funding but also ongoing management. States that build transportation scheduling systems must identify permanent homes for platform operation. Technology requires maintenance, updates, and staffing.</p>
<p><strong>Community paramedicine</strong> depends on reimbursement policy evolution. If Medicare and Medicaid establish payment for community paramedicine services by 2030, programs can sustain on service revenue. If payment policy does not evolve, programs collapse when grant funding ends.</p>
<p><strong>Volunteer programs</strong> face demographic headwinds regardless of RHTP. The volunteer driver shortage will intensify as rural populations age. RHTP might temporarily boost recruitment, but underlying demographic trends continue.</p>
<h3 id="realistic-expectations">Realistic Expectations<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#realistic-expectations">#</a></h3>
<p>RHTP can improve rural transportation at the margins. Coordination will extract more value from existing resources. Mobile services will reach some patients who could not otherwise receive care. Community paramedicine will divert some emergency transports. Telehealth will eliminate some trips.</p>
<p><strong>RHTP cannot solve rural transportation.</strong> The problem is too large, too infrastructural, and too far outside healthcare&rsquo;s scope for a healthcare transformation program to address fundamentally. States that position RHTP transportation investments as comprehensive solutions set expectations that cannot be met.</p>
<p>The honest framing: transportation is a problem that healthcare must work around rather than a problem healthcare can solve. RHTP investments should maximize workarounds while acknowledging that the underlying challenge will persist.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>Transportation functions as the invisible infrastructure beneath all rural health services. Patients who cannot reach care cannot receive care, regardless of provider availability, insurance coverage, or treatment quality. This foundational role makes transportation among the most important factors in rural health outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>RHTP cannot build transportation systems.</strong> The program can coordinate existing resources, fund mobile alternatives, support community paramedicine, and enhance telehealth as a transportation substitute. These interventions help at the margins without addressing the fundamental challenge of rural mobility.</p>
<p>Evidence supports investment in NEMT enhancement, mobile health units, and community paramedicine, with varying strength and rural applicability. Volunteer driver programs provide cost-effective service but face sustainability challenges as volunteer pools shrink. Rideshare partnerships offer little rural value given driver unavailability.</p>
<p><strong>States implementing RHTP transportation initiatives should pursue coordination over construction, target populations with intensive needs, and build sustainability mechanisms into program design from inception.</strong> Mobile and treat-in-place models offer the most promising pathway by eliminating transportation need rather than attempting to meet it.</p>
<p>The fundamental reality: rural transportation is a generational infrastructure challenge that healthcare transformation programs cannot solve. RHTP investments should maximize achievable improvements while maintaining honest assessment of what five years of grant funding can and cannot accomplish against problems decades in the making.</p>
