  "articleBody": "Rosa Medina closes her laptop after documenting Maria Gonzalez’s food insecurity, transportation barriers, and social isolation. Three referrals generate automatically in the electronic health record. The nearest food bank operates 72 miles away on a schedule Maria cannot reach. The county has no public transit. Rosa will return Thursday with groceries purchased from her own kitchen, as she has done for three years. This is not reimbursable. The referrals remain technically active, practically meaningless.\nThis vignette captures the central tension in community health worker deployment for rural transformation. CHWs represent the fastest deployable element of workforce development, requiring three to twelve months of training compared to a decade for physicians or six years for nurse practitioners. States must demonstrate measurable progress within RHTP’s two-year obligation window and complete transformation by 2030, making CHWs attractive within program constraints. Nearly every state application includes CHW deployment. Texas targets 500 new CHWs across rural areas, California proposes 200 certifications with regional deployment priorities, and North Carolina plans to add 200 CHWs annually. These numbers appear in applications. Whether they survive implementation depends on factors applications rarely address: who employs them, who supervises them, who pays them beyond grants, and what happens when RHTP funding ends in 2030.\nThe evidence supporting CHW effectiveness developed primarily in urban safety-net settings serving low-income populations with high chronic disease burden. Systematic reviews demonstrate moderate effects on chronic disease management, cancer screening uptake, and care transitions in metropolitan areas. The IMPaCT model from Penn Center for Community Health Workers showed that CHW intervention reduced hospitalizations and generated returns of $2.47 per dollar invested to Medicaid within the fiscal year through avoided admissions. Randomized controlled trials examining 36 interventions found that CHWs effectively promote cardiovascular risk reduction, improve diabetes control, and increase cancer screening rates among vulnerable populations. Maternal health interventions show strong evidence, with Arizona’s Health Start program demonstrating reduced low birth weight rates among minority women. Effect sizes, while statistically significant, remain moderate rather than transformative.\nRural America differs systematically from these study settings in ways that challenge transferability. Geographic dispersion creates immediate problems when a CHW in West Texas serves patients scattered across 50 miles of ranch roads rather than within walking distance of each other in urban Philadelphia. Transportation emerges as the largest overhead expense for rural CHW programs, a cost Medicaid does not reimburse. CHWs in frontier areas may spend more time driving than delivering services. Resource scarcity limits what navigation can accomplish. The CHW role centers on identifying social needs and connecting patients to resources, but rural counties often lack these resources entirely. A CHW can screen for food insecurity, but if the nearest food bank operates 40 miles away with limited hours, the referral produces limited benefit. The navigation model assumes a destination.\nSupervision infrastructure barely exists in many rural areas. Effective CHW programs require clinical oversight from licensed providers who review care plans, authorize referrals, and ensure appropriate scope of practice. In rural areas experiencing primary care shortages, physicians and nurse practitioners already operate at capacity. Adding CHW supervision to their responsibilities increases burden on already strained providers. Rural facilities rarely have the administrative capacity to manage CHW programs, track outcomes, provide continuing education, and ensure quality. The employer question determines sustainability more than any other factor. In urban settings, large health systems, federally qualified health centers, managed care organizations, and health departments serve as CHW employers. Rural areas have fewer organizational options. Small critical access hospitals operate on thin margins. Rural FQHCs lack administrative bandwidth. County health departments may employ one or two staff total.\nThe rural evidence gap compounds these challenges. A 2024 systematic review examining CHW effectiveness during COVID-19 found 15 studies meeting inclusion criteria, with high risk of bias across 14 of 15 studies. Rural CHW research in the United States remains sparse. The evidence comes from settings unlike the rural communities where RHTP expects deployment, requiring assumptions about transferability that research has not validated. Evidence for CHW effectiveness in behavioral health remains particularly insufficient, despite pressure to deploy CHWs for mental health support given the shortage of behavioral health providers in rural areas. This pressure exceeds what evidence supports.\nHospital employment places CHWs closest to clinical care but creates vulnerability. Rural hospitals operating on thin margins often cut community health positions first during financial stress, and CHWs may experience mission drift toward discharge planning and readmission prevention rather than broader community health improvement. Community-based organization employment maintains community connection but struggles with sustainability, as CBOs depend on grants and contracts that fluctuate annually. Turnover rates at CBO-employed CHW programs run as high as 50% annually, destroying the relationship continuity that makes intervention effective. Managed care organization employment offers the most sustainable funding pathway through capitation payments, but MCO-employed CHWs may prioritize high-cost member management over community health improvement. Health department employment provides stability but limited clinical integration, as department CHWs often lack connection to clinical care delivery.\nAs of 2025, most states operate some form of CHW recognition or certification program, though requirements vary dramatically. Texas established the first comprehensive state certification in 2001, requiring 160 hours of competency-based training across eight core competencies. By 2024, Texas had certified over 8,666 CHWs serving 189 counties, a 33% increase from 2023. More than half of state Medicaid programs now provide some form of CHW coverage, up from roughly 29 states in 2022. States implement coverage through State Plan Amendments adding CHW services as covered Medicaid benefits, Section 1115 demonstration waivers testing innovative approaches, and managed care organization contracts requiring or incentivizing CHW services. The 2024 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule introduced the first Medicare billing codes for CHW services through Community Health Integration and Principal Illness Navigation codes, which several states have adopted for Medicaid reimbursement.\nCertification affects wages but has not eliminated wage disparities. A 2022 study found that CHW wages increased by $2.42 per hour in states with certification programs compared to states without programs, with earliest adopters seeing increases of $14.46 over the study period. The median annual wage for community health workers was $51,030 in May 2024, approximately $10,000 less than the median wage for all occupations. Low wages drive turnover consistently identified as the leading predictor of premature resignation among frontline health workers. The Penn Center for Community Health Workers offers annual compensation between $53,000 and $66,000 including benefits, achieving an annual turnover rate of 2.5% over the past decade compared with typical rates as high as 50% elsewhere. The difference comes from adequate compensation, benefits, career pathways, and organizational commitment.\nRHTP applications reveal variation in whether CHW programs receive distinct funding, explicit deployment targets, and protected budget allocations. Texas proposes 500 new CHWs plus 300 employed positions, building on two decades of certification infrastructure and existing Medicaid reimbursement pathways that provide sustainability beyond RHTP funding. California targets regional deployment with $8 to $12 million across five years but faces at-risk status as social care components compete with clinical transformation priorities. Tennessee operates a distinct initiative targeting 60 to 100 positions through approximately 20 organizations with state association accreditation requirements. Georgia explicitly cut CHW funding from implementation, prioritizing clinical infrastructure over community health workforce. This decision reflects tradeoff pressures affecting states with limited allocations and competing priorities.\nPromising applications include states with existing CHW certification and Medicaid reimbursement infrastructure that can build on established systems, applications naming specific employer organizations and supervision arrangements demonstrating implementation planning, integration with existing Medicaid payment reforms suggesting sustainability pathways, and protected CHW budget lines separate from general workforce funding reducing vulnerability to reallocation. Red flags include applications listing CHW deployment without employer or supervision details lacking implementation infrastructure, states without certification proposing immediate deployment facing workforce quality risks, CHW initiatives embedded within workforce development without distinct funding facing elimination risk, and targets specified only in percentage terms without baseline numbers obscuring actual commitment.\nClinical supervision capacity is the binding constraint for rural CHW deployment. CHWs must work under supervision of licensed providers who review care plans and ensure appropriate practice boundaries. Rural primary care providers already operating at capacity face additional burden from CHW supervision that may not be sustainable. Options include hub-based supervision where regional facilities provide clinical oversight for CHWs serving surrounding communities, telehealth supervision with remote providers reviewing documentation and care plans, shared supervision through intermediary organizations providing oversight across multiple employers, and community college nursing program partnerships providing student supervision experience while supporting programs.\nCHW programs face a fundamental choice between recruiting from outside communities versus training community members to serve their neighbors. Growing local approaches recruit and train community members who already have trusted relationships and local knowledge, preserving the trusted member characteristic central to effectiveness. However, growing local workforce requires training infrastructure, takes time to develop, and may face challenges if community members lack educational prerequisites. External deployment places trained CHWs from\n",

<p>Rosa Medina closes her laptop after documenting Maria Gonzalez&rsquo;s food insecurity, transportation barriers, and social isolation. Three referrals generate automatically in the electronic health record. The nearest food bank operates 72 miles away on a schedule Maria cannot reach. The county has no public transit. Rosa will return Thursday with groceries purchased from her own kitchen, as she has done for three years. This is not reimbursable. The referrals remain technically active, practically meaningless.</p>
<p>This vignette captures the central tension in community health worker deployment for rural transformation. CHWs represent the fastest deployable element of workforce development, requiring three to twelve months of training compared to a decade for physicians or six years for nurse practitioners. States must demonstrate measurable progress within RHTP&rsquo;s two-year obligation window and complete transformation by 2030, making CHWs attractive within program constraints. Nearly every state application includes CHW deployment. <strong>Texas targets 500 new CHWs across rural areas, California proposes 200 certifications with regional deployment priorities, and North Carolina plans to add 200 CHWs annually.</strong> These numbers appear in applications. Whether they survive implementation depends on factors applications rarely address: who employs them, who supervises them, who pays them beyond grants, and what happens when RHTP funding ends in 2030.</p>
<p>The evidence supporting CHW effectiveness developed primarily in urban safety-net settings serving low-income populations with high chronic disease burden. Systematic reviews demonstrate moderate effects on chronic disease management, cancer screening uptake, and care transitions in metropolitan areas. The IMPaCT model from Penn Center for Community Health Workers showed that CHW intervention reduced hospitalizations and generated returns of $2.47 per dollar invested to Medicaid within the fiscal year through avoided admissions. Randomized controlled trials examining 36 interventions found that <strong>CHWs effectively promote cardiovascular risk reduction, improve diabetes control, and increase cancer screening rates</strong> among vulnerable populations. Maternal health interventions show strong evidence, with Arizona&rsquo;s Health Start program demonstrating reduced low birth weight rates among minority women. Effect sizes, while statistically significant, remain moderate rather than transformative.</p>
<p>Rural America differs systematically from these study settings in ways that challenge transferability. Geographic dispersion creates immediate problems when a CHW in West Texas serves patients scattered across 50 miles of ranch roads rather than within walking distance of each other in urban Philadelphia. <strong>Transportation emerges as the largest overhead expense</strong> for rural CHW programs, a cost Medicaid does not reimburse. CHWs in frontier areas may spend more time driving than delivering services. Resource scarcity limits what navigation can accomplish. The CHW role centers on identifying social needs and connecting patients to resources, but <strong>rural counties often lack these resources entirely</strong>. A CHW can screen for food insecurity, but if the nearest food bank operates 40 miles away with limited hours, the referral produces limited benefit. The navigation model assumes a destination.</p>
<p>Supervision infrastructure barely exists in many rural areas. Effective CHW programs require clinical oversight from licensed providers who review care plans, authorize referrals, and ensure appropriate scope of practice. In rural areas experiencing primary care shortages, <strong>physicians and nurse practitioners already operate at capacity</strong>. Adding CHW supervision to their responsibilities increases burden on already strained providers. Rural facilities rarely have the administrative capacity to manage CHW programs, track outcomes, provide continuing education, and ensure quality. The employer question determines sustainability more than any other factor. In urban settings, large health systems, federally qualified health centers, managed care organizations, and health departments serve as CHW employers. Rural areas have fewer organizational options. Small critical access hospitals operate on thin margins. Rural FQHCs lack administrative bandwidth. County health departments may employ one or two staff total.</p>
<p>The rural evidence gap compounds these challenges. A 2024 systematic review examining CHW effectiveness during COVID-19 found 15 studies meeting inclusion criteria, with high risk of bias across 14 of 15 studies. Rural CHW research in the United States remains sparse. The evidence comes from settings unlike the rural communities where RHTP expects deployment, requiring assumptions about transferability that research has not validated. Evidence for CHW effectiveness in behavioral health remains particularly insufficient, despite pressure to deploy CHWs for mental health support given the shortage of behavioral health providers in rural areas. This pressure exceeds what evidence supports.</p>
<p>Hospital employment places CHWs closest to clinical care but creates vulnerability. Rural hospitals operating on thin margins often cut community health positions first during financial stress, and CHWs may experience <strong>mission drift toward discharge planning and readmission prevention</strong> rather than broader community health improvement. Community-based organization employment maintains community connection but struggles with sustainability, as CBOs depend on grants and contracts that fluctuate annually. <strong>Turnover rates at CBO-employed CHW programs run as high as 50% annually</strong>, destroying the relationship continuity that makes intervention effective. Managed care organization employment offers the most sustainable funding pathway through capitation payments, but MCO-employed CHWs may prioritize high-cost member management over community health improvement. Health department employment provides stability but limited clinical integration, as department CHWs often lack connection to clinical care delivery.</p>
<p>As of 2025, most states operate some form of CHW recognition or certification program, though requirements vary dramatically. Texas established the first comprehensive state certification in 2001, requiring 160 hours of competency-based training across eight core competencies. By 2024, Texas had certified over 8,666 CHWs serving 189 counties, a 33% increase from 2023. <strong>More than half of state Medicaid programs now provide some form of CHW coverage</strong>, up from roughly 29 states in 2022. States implement coverage through State Plan Amendments adding CHW services as covered Medicaid benefits, Section 1115 demonstration waivers testing innovative approaches, and managed care organization contracts requiring or incentivizing CHW services. The 2024 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule introduced the first Medicare billing codes for CHW services through Community Health Integration and Principal Illness Navigation codes, which several states have adopted for Medicaid reimbursement.</p>
<p>Certification affects wages but has not eliminated wage disparities. A 2022 study found that <strong>CHW wages increased by $2.42 per hour in states with certification programs</strong> compared to states without programs, with earliest adopters seeing increases of $14.46 over the study period. The median annual wage for community health workers was $51,030 in May 2024, approximately $10,000 less than the median wage for all occupations. Low wages drive turnover consistently identified as the leading predictor of premature resignation among frontline health workers. The Penn Center for Community Health Workers offers annual compensation between $53,000 and $66,000 including benefits, achieving an annual turnover rate of 2.5% over the past decade compared with typical rates as high as 50% elsewhere. The difference comes from adequate compensation, benefits, career pathways, and organizational commitment.</p>
<p>RHTP applications reveal variation in whether CHW programs receive distinct funding, explicit deployment targets, and protected budget allocations. Texas proposes 500 new CHWs plus 300 employed positions, building on two decades of certification infrastructure and existing Medicaid reimbursement pathways that provide sustainability beyond RHTP funding. California targets regional deployment with $8 to $12 million across five years but faces at-risk status as social care components compete with clinical transformation priorities. Tennessee operates a distinct initiative targeting 60 to 100 positions through approximately 20 organizations with state association accreditation requirements. Georgia explicitly cut CHW funding from implementation, prioritizing clinical infrastructure over community health workforce. This decision reflects tradeoff pressures affecting states with limited allocations and competing priorities.</p>
<p>Promising applications include states with existing CHW certification and Medicaid reimbursement infrastructure that can build on established systems, applications naming specific employer organizations and supervision arrangements demonstrating implementation planning, integration with existing Medicaid payment reforms suggesting sustainability pathways, and protected CHW budget lines separate from general workforce funding reducing vulnerability to reallocation. Red flags include applications listing CHW deployment without employer or supervision details lacking implementation infrastructure, states without certification proposing immediate deployment facing workforce quality risks, CHW initiatives embedded within workforce development without distinct funding facing elimination risk, and targets specified only in percentage terms without baseline numbers obscuring actual commitment.</p>
<p><strong>Clinical supervision capacity is the binding constraint</strong> for rural CHW deployment. CHWs must work under supervision of licensed providers who review care plans and ensure appropriate practice boundaries. Rural primary care providers already operating at capacity face additional burden from CHW supervision that may not be sustainable. Options include hub-based supervision where regional facilities provide clinical oversight for CHWs serving surrounding communities, telehealth supervision with remote providers reviewing documentation and care plans, shared supervision through intermediary organizations providing oversight across multiple employers, and community college nursing program partnerships providing student supervision experience while supporting programs.</p>
<p>CHW programs face a fundamental choice between recruiting from outside communities versus training community members to serve their neighbors. Growing local approaches recruit and train community members who already have trusted relationships and local knowledge, preserving the trusted member characteristic central to effectiveness. However, growing local workforce requires training infrastructure, takes time to develop, and may face challenges if community members lack educational prerequisites. External deployment places trained CHWs from</p>
