  "articleBody": "What reimbursement sustains rural care?\nIntroduction Fee-for-service payment is fundamentally incompatible with rural healthcare delivery. This statement, while provocative, rests on arithmetic that rural hospital administrators confront daily. A hospital with high fixed costs and low patient volume cannot survive on per-service payments that fluctuate with demand. The emergency department must be staffed 24 hours regardless of whether five patients or fifty arrive. The lab technician earns the same salary whether running thirty tests or three hundred. The building depreciates at the same rate whether beds sit empty or full. When revenue depends on volume but costs remain constant, financial viability becomes a function of factors largely beyond administrative control.\nThe Pennsylvania Rural Health Model demonstrated what happens when rural hospitals receive predictable, prospective revenue instead of volume-dependent payments. All eighteen participating hospitals remained open through the COVID-19 pandemic, a period that devastated fee-for-service dependent facilities nationwide. Yet rigorous evaluation produced mixed evidence on financial improvement, with adjusted models showing nonsignificant margin increases. The model preserved access without demonstrating the transformative financial benefits advocates anticipated. This outcome, neither failure nor triumph, captures the complexity of rural payment reform.\nRHTP applications invoke “value-based payment” with remarkable consistency. Nearly every state proposes transitioning rural providers toward alternative payment models. Yet the applications rarely engage with the evidence base, which reveals that standard value-based care approaches often fail in rural settings. The patient populations are too small for meaningful risk adjustment. The provider panels lack the volume to make shared savings arithmetic work. The quality measurement infrastructure that enables performance assessment in urban systems barely exists. States are proposing payment innovation for settings where the preconditions for that innovation are absent.\nThe core question for payment reform is not whether fee-for-service harms rural hospitals. The evidence on that point is unambiguous. The question is whether alternative payment models can be designed, implemented, and sustained in settings that systematically lack the characteristics associated with payment reform success. Rural areas need something different from the ACO models and bundled payments that have shown modest effects in larger systems. They need payment approaches built specifically for high-cost, low-volume, geographically isolated delivery environments. RHTP creates an opportunity to develop such approaches. Whether states seize that opportunity or simply apply urban payment reform templates to rural settings will determine whether payment innovation produces durable transformation or temporary experimentation.\nThe Rural Context Low volume as financial poison. Rural healthcare operates at scale disadvantages that payment systems designed for metropolitan markets cannot address. A 25-bed Critical Access Hospital serving a county of 10,000 people cannot spread fixed costs across patient volume the way a 500-bed urban system can. The fundamental economics differ qualitatively, not just quantitatively. When patient volume drops by 10% at a large hospital, the organization adjusts staffing ratios and waits for the next surge. When volume drops 10% at a small rural hospital, the margin between survival and closure narrows.\nThe mechanics of CAH cost-based reimbursement illustrate both the protection Medicare provides rural facilities and its limitations. Medicare pays CAHs 101% of reasonable costs for inpatient and outpatient services, ensuring that Medicare patients do not generate losses. This cost-based approach insulates CAHs from the volume volatility that threatens other rural facilities. However, the protection applies only to Medicare. Private payers typically reimburse CAHs at rates similar to those paid to urban facilities, regardless of the higher per-unit costs rural facilities incur. Medicaid rates vary by state but generally fall below cost. The result: Medicare sustains CAHs while private payers and Medicaid erode that support.\nPayer mix determines viability in ways payment reform rarely addresses. Rural populations skew older, making Medicare the dominant payer at most rural facilities. This concentration creates both stability (Medicare pays reliably) and vulnerability (Medicare rate changes disproportionately affect rural hospitals). Commercial insurance presence varies dramatically. Agricultural communities may have significant employer-sponsored coverage; retirement destinations may have almost none. Medicaid coverage depends on expansion status and state reimbursement policies. A rural hospital in expansion-state Minnesota operates in a fundamentally different financial environment than one in non-expansion Texas, regardless of their identical RHTP participation.\nWhy value-based care math often fails rurally. Standard value-based payment models rest on assumptions that rural settings violate. Accountable care organizations require a minimum of 5,000 attributed Medicare beneficiaries to achieve statistical reliability in quality measurement and cost benchmarking. Many rural counties lack 5,000 total Medicare beneficiaries, let alone 5,000 who can be attributed to a single ACO. Shared savings models assume that coordinated care will reduce hospitalizations and emergency visits, generating savings to share. When the baseline utilization is already low (because patients defer care or travel elsewhere), the savings potential diminishes. Bundled payments assume sufficient procedure volume to absorb variation in individual case costs. A hospital performing twenty joint replacements annually cannot absorb the financial impact of one complex case the way a facility performing two hundred can.\nAttribution challenges compound the difficulty. Value-based models attribute patients to providers based on claims patterns. Rural patients often receive primary care locally and specialty care in distant urban centers. Attribution methodologies struggle with this split, sometimes attributing patients to urban specialists who see them once annually rather than rural primary care providers who see them quarterly. The ACO that ends up accountable for the patient may have little ability to influence their care. Cross-boundary patterns that seem logical from a patient perspective create accountability problems that payment models were not designed to address.\nQuality measurement capacity barely exists. Performance-based payment requires measuring performance. Large health systems maintain quality departments, employ data analysts, and invest in electronic health records capable of generating the measures CMS requires. Small rural hospitals often lack all three. The electronic health record at a 15-bed CAH may be adequate for clinical documentation but incapable of producing the quality reports ACO participation demands. A 2025 CMS finding that Shared Savings Program ACOs include over 10,000 FQHCs, RHCs, and CAHs represents growth, but participating rural facilities often depend on larger partners to handle the measurement and reporting infrastructure.\nThe RHTP payment innovation context. State applications propose value-based arrangements without acknowledging these constraints. Value-based care language appears in nearly every application, but specific payment model designs rarely reflect rural realities. The few applications that engage payment mechanics typically propose replicating urban models (ACOs, shared savings, care management fees) rather than developing rural-specific approaches. RHTP funding could support the infrastructure investment (data capacity, care coordination staff, quality measurement systems) that rural facilities need to participate in alternative payment models. Whether states invest in this infrastructure or simply add value-based care language to existing fee-for-service operations will determine payment reform outcomes.\nEvidence Review Evidence Rating Table Intervention Evidence Quality Effect Size Rural Evidence Implementation Difficulty Global budget (Pennsylvania model) Moderate Small-Moderate Yes Very High Global budget (Maryland model) Strong Moderate Limited Very High Prospective payment for rural hospitals Moderate Stabilizing Yes Moderate Medicare Shared Savings Program ACOs Strong Small-Moderate Limited High ACO REACH model Limited Unknown Limited High Bundled payments Moderate Small Very Limited High AHEAD model Insufficient Unknown By design Very High Rural Emergency Hospital payment Insufficient Unknown By design High Capitation for rural primary care Limited Variable Very Limited Very High Pay-for-performance (rural) Limited Small Limited Moderate Global Budget Evidence The Pennsylvania Rural Health Model (PARHM) provides the most rigorous evidence on global budgets for rural hospitals. Operating from 2019 through 2024, PARHM paid eighteen rural hospitals prospective global budgets covering inpatient and outpatient services across all payers. Hospitals developed transformation plans and received predictable revenue regardless of volume fluctuations.\nOutcomes assessment reveals both success and limitation. A 2024 Health Affairs Scholar study found early reductions in potentially avoidable utilization, consistent with the model’s theory that global budgets would incentivize ambulatory care improvement. All eighteen hospitals remained operational through the pandemic, when fee-for-service dependent facilities faced devastating volume collapses. Hospital executives consistently report that budget predictability enabled planning and investment impossible under volume-dependent payment.\nHowever, rigorous financial evaluation produced mixed results. A July 2025 Health Affairs study using synthetic difference-in-differences methodology found that PARHM participation was associated with a 4.5 percentage point increase in operating margins in unadjusted models. After adjustment for hospital characteristics and market factors, the improvement shrank to 3.0 percentage points and became statistically nonsignificant. Comparison with rural hospitals in five border states showed similar patterns. The authors concluded that global budgets alone may be insufficient to reverse rural hospital financial decline without broader community economic development and workforce investment.\nMaryland’s Total Cost of Care model demonstrates global budgets at scale. Operating since 2014, Maryland’s all-payer rate-setting system pays each hospital a predetermined annual revenue amount, with rates set by the Health Services Cost Review Commission. All payers, including Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial insurers, pay the same rates. Rigorous evaluation demonstrates significant Medicare savings and reduced readmissions compared to national trends.\nThe Maryland model’s rural applicability is limited by several factors. First, Maryland has regulatory authority no other state possesses: the ability to set Medicare rates through federal waiver. Second, Maryland’s rural areas are relatively proximate to Baltimore and Washington, unlike the isolated rural communities in larger states. Third, the infrastructure for all-payer rate-setting took decades to develop. States cannot replicate Maryland overnight.\nACO Evidence The Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) has generated the strongest evidence on accountable care. A June 2025 JAMA study using difference-in-differences methodology found that ACO formation was associated with mean differential reductions of $142 (1.2%) in annual per-patient spending over three years and $294 (2.4%) over six years. These results contrast with earlier Congressional Budget Office analyses suggesting minimal savings. The study attributed differences to its longer observation period, noting that savings increased over time as ACOs developed care coordination capabilities.\nRural ACO participation has grown but remains limited. CMS reports that the Shared Savings Program included 476 ACOs in 2025, with participation from 10,455 FQHCs, RHCs, and Critical Access Hospitals, a 16% increase from 2024. The Advance Investment Payment (AIP) program, providing upfront funding to new ACOs in rural and underserved areas, has attracted 28 participating ACOs, with half of attributed beneficiaries in rural or underserved communities.\nHowever, the ACO REACH model targeting equity and access has not enrolled the intended population. A 2025 JAMA Health Forum cross-sectional analysis found that REACH beneficiaries were significantly less likely to be rural (3.9% vs. 8.4% in Medicare overall), less likely to reside in high-vulnerability areas, and more likely to be White than the broader Medicare population. The model designed to reduce rural health inequities has not reached rural populations at meaningful scale.\nRural Emergency Hospital Payment The Rural Emergency Hospital (REH) designation, available since January 2023, offers an alternative payment pathway for struggling facilities. REHs receive 105% of standard OPPS rates for outpatient services plus a monthly facility payment ($285,626 in 2025), in exchange for eliminating inpatient services and maintaining 24/7 emergency care. As of October 2025, 42 hospitals have converted to REH status.\nConversion rates have been lower than projected. CMS initially estimated $408 million in REH payments for 2023; actual payments were approximately $30 million, reflecting the 19 facilities that converted (most in the second half of the year). Hospitals cite several barriers: loss of 340B drug pricing program eligibility, loss of swing bed revenue, unclear Medicaid reimbursement, and community resistance to losing inpatient services.\nThe evidence on REH financial sustainability remains insufficient. The designation is too new for rigorous evaluation. Facilities that have converted report varying experiences. Some have achieved financial stability; others struggle with the monthly payment proving inadequate for their cost structures. The model assumes that communities can function without local inpatient care, an assumption communities themselves often reject.\nValue-Based Care Implementation Challenges The AMA Council on Medical Service 2025 report documented the fundamental mismatch between value-based payment designs and rural realities. The council adopted policy supporting minimum standards for alternative payment models specific to rural hospitals:\nFixed-cost payment: Rural hospitals should receive predetermined amounts on predictable schedules not tied to volume Adequate payment rates: All payers must ensure payments cover full cost of care provision Reasonable patient cost-sharing: Out-of-pocket payments must be affordable Administrative simplicity: Models must minimize reporting and compliance burdens These standards implicitly acknowledge that existing value-based models fail to meet rural needs. The standards describe what payment reform should provide, not what current models actually deliver.\nRural-Specific Payment Models Global Budget Approaches Model Description Evidence Current Status Pennsylvania Rural Health Model Fixed annual budget, all-payer, hospital transformation plans Mixed financial, strong access Ended December 2024 Maryland Total Cost of Care State rate-setting, population health accountability Strong savings evidence Transitioning to AHEAD 2026 AHEAD Model State total cost of care targets, hospital global budgets, primary care investment Insufficient (new) 6 states, performance begins 2026/2028 The AHEAD Model (Achieving Healthcare Efficiency through Accountable Design) represents CMS’s current approach to state-based payment reform. Six states will participate: Maryland (Cohort 1), Connecticut, Hawaii, and Vermont (Cohort 2, performance beginning 2028), and Rhode Island and five New York counties (Cohort 3). The model runs through December 2035.\nAHEAD requires participating states to meet total cost of care targets across Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial payers. Hospitals can participate in global budgets with population health accountability. Critical Access Hospitals receive special accommodations: delayed penalties for avoidable utilization, additional time in upside-only arrangements, and a payment floor based on most recent cost reports.\nSeptember 2025 policy changes modified AHEAD significantly, extending timeline and adding geographic attribution for beneficiaries not attributed to other ACO programs. CMS will offer up to two additional states the opportunity to join in July 2026. The model’s rural implications remain theoretical until performance data emerge.\nEnhanced Payment Designations Rural hospitals can access enhanced Medicare payments through several designations, each with distinct eligibility and benefit structures:\nCritical Access Hospital (CAH): Cost-based reimbursement at 101% of reasonable costs for Medicare. Requires 25 or fewer beds, 35+ mile distance from next hospital (or state certification as necessary provider), and 96-hour average length of stay. Approximately 1,360 CAHs operate nationally.\nSole Community Hospital (SCH): Enhanced payment through either cost-based or prospective payment, whichever is higher. Must be 35+ miles from similar hospitals or meet geographic or travel time criteria. Provides payment protection during volume fluctuations.\nMedicare Dependent Hospital (MDH): Additional payments for rural hospitals with 100 or fewer beds where Medicare inpatients exceed 60% of total. Provides cost-based floor similar to SCH.\nLow-Volume Hospital (LVH): Payment adjustment for hospitals with fewer than 3,800 discharges annually and 15+ miles from similar facilities. Adjustment ranges from 25% at lowest volume to 0% at 3,800 discharges.\nThese designations provide meaningful payment support but do not address the fundamental fee-for-service volume dependence that threatens rural facilities. A CAH receiving cost-based Medicare payment still faces losses on private payers and Medicaid. A low-volume adjustment helps at the margin but cannot compensate for the structural disadvantages of small-scale operation.\nState Program Examples Pennsylvania’s Experience The Pennsylvania Rural Health Model concluded December 2024 after six performance years. Eighteen hospitals participated, receiving global budgets that placed 75-90% of revenue under prospective payment. The Rural Health Care Redesign Center provided technical assistance and model administration.\nAccomplishments include:\nAll participating hospitals remained open through COVID-19 Voluntary participation sustained throughout the model period Hospital executives report improved planning capacity and investment ability Early evidence of potentially avoidable utilization reduction Limitations revealed:\nFinancial improvement did not reach statistical significance in rigorous evaluation Model required substantial federal investment and state administrative capacity Global budgets alone proved insufficient without addressing workforce and economic development Commercial payer participation remained limited despite all-payer design intent Pennsylvania’s experience suggests that global budgets can preserve access and provide stability without necessarily transforming financial performance. The model’s value may lie in preventing closure rather than generating profit.\nVermont’s All-Payer Model Vermont has operated an all-payer ACO model since 2017, with most hospitals participating voluntarily. The model holds OneCare Vermont, the state’s ACO, accountable for total cost of care across Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial populations. Hospitals receive a mix of fee-for-service and fixed payments.\nThe Vermont model demonstrates that small states with cooperative hospital relationships can implement population-based payment. However, Vermont’s unique characteristics (small size, relatively homogeneous population, history of health reform experimentation) limit generalizability. Vermont will transition to AHEAD in 2028, providing an opportunity to test whether the federal framework can support state-specific approaches.\nMaryland’s Transition Maryland’s all-payer system, operating since the 1970s, will transition to AHEAD beginning January 2026. The transition raises questions about whether the federal framework can accommodate Maryland’s regulatory infrastructure or whether AHEAD’s standardized approach will constrain Maryland’s flexibility.\nFor rural areas specifically, the transition introduces uncertainty. Maryland’s Eastern Shore hospitals have operated under global budgets with predictable revenue for decades. The AHEAD model’s quality requirements and cost growth targets may impose new performance pressures. Whether AHEAD preserves the financial stability Maryland’s rural hospitals have achieved remains to be seen.\nRHTP Application Assessment Value-Based Care Language Prevalence Virtually every RHTP application includes value-based payment proposals. The language varies:\nTexas proposes “alternative payment model readiness” without specifying which models California plans value-based payment evaluation and rural payment model landscape assessment North Carolina targets “rural provider transition to value-based payment” with primary care capitation pilots Ohio references innovation hubs creating “value-based payment arrangements” What Applications Lack Realistic timelines: Payment model transitions require years of preparation. Provider contracting, actuarial analysis, quality measurement infrastructure, and care management capacity cannot be built within RHTP’s two-year obligation window. Applications proposing value-based transformation by 2027 or 2028 underestimate implementation requirements.\nInfrastructure acknowledgment: Successful payment reform requires data analytics capacity, care coordination staffing, quality measurement systems, and provider engagement processes. Few applications detail how RHTP funding will build this infrastructure rather than simply declaring value-based care intent.\nPayer participation strategies: Medicare alternative payment models exist. The challenge for states is engaging Medicaid managed care organizations and commercial payers. Applications rarely address how states will secure payer participation beyond Medicare demonstrations already available.\nRural-specific design: Applications frequently propose extending urban payment models (ACOs, bundled payments, performance bonuses) to rural settings without addressing the volume, attribution, and measurement limitations that cause these models to fail rurally. Genuinely rural-specific payment approaches remain rare.\nPromising Elements Some applications demonstrate more sophisticated payment thinking:\nCalifornia’s Transformative Payments provide upfront infrastructure funding not tied to service volume, acknowledging that rural facilities need investment capital before they can succeed in performance-based arrangements.\nNorth Carolina’s primary care capitation pilots test whether prospective payment can stabilize rural primary care before expanding to broader population-based models.\nVermont’s AHEAD participation builds on existing all-payer experience, potentially demonstrating how federal frameworks can accommodate state innovation.\nImplementation Reality Multi-Payer Alignment Challenges Global budgets and total cost of care models require participation across payers to succeed. Medicare participation alone, while valuable, leaves hospitals exposed to fee-for-service volatility from commercial and Medicaid revenue. Pennsylvania’s experience demonstrates the difficulty: despite “all-payer” design, commercial participation remained limited.\nSecuring commercial payer participation requires either regulatory authority (Maryland’s unique position), market leverage (which rural hospitals lack), or financial incentives sufficient to overcome insurers’ preference for fee-for-service payment in low-negotiating-power markets. States cannot simply declare all-payer participation and expect insurers to comply.\nMedicaid alignment depends on state Medicaid agency capacity and managed care organization cooperation. States with fully managed Medicaid programs can potentially require MCO participation in state payment initiatives. States with fragmented Medicaid landscapes face coordination challenges across multiple managed care contracts.\nAdministrative Capacity Requirements Payment reform demands administrative infrastructure that many states lack:\nActuarial expertise for setting global budgets and benchmarks Data systems capable of tracking total cost of care across payers Quality measurement infrastructure for performance assessment Provider engagement capacity for negotiating participation and monitoring compliance Technical assistance resources for helping rural facilities adapt to new payment models RHTP could fund this infrastructure, but applications often allocate minimal resources to administrative capacity. States proposing ambitious payment reform with single-digit-percentage administrative budgets are likely underestimating implementation requirements.\nPolitical Sustainability Payment models that constrain revenue growth face political vulnerability. When hospitals argue that global budgets are inadequate, legislators hear from constituents worried about local facility closure. The Pennsylvania model survived six years through bipartisan support and hospital satisfaction with budget predictability. Not all states will achieve similar political consensus.\nThe 2030 cliff compounds political risk. RHTP-supported payment initiatives must transition to sustainable financing by program sunset. If payment reform depends on continued federal subsidy, post-2030 sustainability requires either ongoing federal commitment (uncertain) or sufficient state resources to maintain reform infrastructure (unlikely in many states).\nThe 2030 Question Payment Reform as Infrastructure vs. Pilot The fundamental question for payment innovation is whether RHTP supports durable infrastructure change or temporary experimentation. Pilot programs that end when federal funding ends produce learning but not transformation. Permanent payment reform requires changes in law, regulation, and payer relationships that survive political transitions.\nDurable approaches include:\nState Medicaid plan amendments institutionalizing alternative payment methods Regulatory frameworks enabling all-payer rate-setting or global budget authority Commercial payer contracts with multi-year value-based payment commitments Provider capacity investments (data systems, care coordination staff) that persist beyond grant periods Temporary approaches include:\nTime-limited demonstration projects without path to permanent authority Payment pilots dependent on continued federal funding Value-based arrangements that revert to fee-for-service when grants end Infrastructure investments that cannot be maintained without ongoing subsidy Whether Alternative Payments Survive Political Transitions Maryland’s payment system has survived both Republican and Democratic administrations for fifty years because the regulatory infrastructure became embedded in state government operations. Pennsylvania’s model ended when the federal demonstration period concluded. The difference lies not in policy merit but in institutional durability.\nRHTP payment initiatives face uncertain political futures. The Trump administration has signaled interest in revising the Maryland agreement, potentially constraining the nation’s most successful hospital payment reform. AHEAD model changes announced in September 2025 extended timelines but also raised questions about federal commitment to state flexibility. States building payment reform on RHTP foundations must consider whether those foundations will persist after political change.\nThe Medicaid Cut Interaction Payment reform assumes stable underlying coverage. Projected $911 billion in Medicaid cuts over ten years would fundamentally alter the financial environment in which payment reform operates. Global budgets calculated on current payer mix become unreliable when Medicaid coverage changes. Value-based arrangements designed for current beneficiary populations require recalibration when populations lose coverage.\nRural areas face disproportionate Medicaid cut exposure. Medicaid covers 25% of rural residents under 65 and 22% of dually eligible individuals. Coverage reductions concentrate in states with non-expansion Medicaid and high uninsured rates, which overlap substantially with states having vulnerable rural hospital infrastructure. Payment reform cannot succeed if the underlying coverage infrastructure collapses.\nRecommendations for State Planners Build Infrastructure Before Reform Payment transformation requires capacity that most rural providers lack. States should sequence RHTP investments to build infrastructure first:\nData systems: Electronic health record upgrades, health information exchange participation, quality reporting capability Care coordination: Care managers, social workers, and community health workers who can execute population health strategies Administrative capacity: Staff trained in value-based contracting, performance measurement, and financial modeling Provider engagement: Relationships and trust enabling collaborative payment redesign Attempting payment reform without this infrastructure produces participation in name only, where providers sign value-based contracts but lack capacity to change care delivery.\nDesign for Rural Realities Standard value-based models require modification for rural application:\nAdjust attribution methodologies to account for split care patterns. Rural patients receiving primary care locally and specialty care distantly need attribution approaches that credit local providers appropriately.\nAggregate risk pools across multiple small providers. Individual rural facilities cannot bear population-based risk, but regional groupings may achieve sufficient scale for meaningful risk-sharing.\nSimplify quality measurement to reduce administrative burden. Rural facilities cannot maintain the quality reporting infrastructure large systems develop. Streamlined measure sets focusing on the most clinically meaningful indicators reduce burden while preserving accountability.\nProvide upside opportunity before downside risk. Rural facilities operating on negative margins cannot absorb losses from failed performance. Payment models should offer savings potential before imposing penalty risk.\nPursue Global Budget Approaches The evidence, while mixed, supports global budgets as the payment approach most compatible with rural healthcare economics. Fixed prospective payment addresses the fundamental volume dependence that fee-for-service creates. Pennsylvania’s experience demonstrates that global budgets can preserve access even when financial transformation proves modest.\nStates should explore AHEAD participation for state-level global budget authority. States not positioned for AHEAD should seek federal demonstration opportunities or develop state-funded global budget pilots.\nEngage Payers Strategically Medicare alternative payment models provide a foundation but not a complete solution. States should:\nLeverage Medicaid managed care contracting authority to require MCO participation in state payment initiatives. Contract requirements can compel alignment that voluntary approaches cannot achieve.\nDevelop business cases for commercial payer participation. Insurers will participate in rural payment reform when they perceive financial benefit. Demonstrating that value-based arrangements reduce costs or administrative burden can motivate engagement.\nCoordinate across programs to reduce provider burden. Multiple value-based contracts with different requirements, measures, and timelines overwhelm rural providers. Aligned approaches across payers simplify participation.\nPlan for Post-2030 Sustainability Every payment initiative should include explicit sustainability planning:\nWhat regulatory or statutory changes are required for permanent implementation? What ongoing administrative costs will the state bear after federal funding ends? What payer commitments extend beyond the RHTP period? What provider capacity investments will persist without continued subsidy? Initiatives that cannot answer these questions are pilots, not transformation.\nCross-References Related Series 2 Articles\n2A: RHTP Structure and Rules (payment innovation requirements) 2B: Medicaid Architecture and the $911B Question (coverage sustainability) 2C: Medicare Rural Provisions (CAH, RHC, and SCH payment mechanics) 2H: The 2030 Cliff (post-sunset payment sustainability) Related Series 4 Transformation Approaches\n4E: Hub-and-Spoke Networks (regional payment arrangements) 4G: Behavioral Health Integration (behavioral health payment) 4B: Workforce Recruitment and Retention (workforce investment financing) State Implementation References\n3.PA: Pennsylvania (Rural Health Model experience) 3.VT: Vermont (All-Payer ACO participation) 3.MD: Maryland (Total Cost of Care Model) 3.CA: California (Transformative Payments) 3.NC: North Carolina (Value-based payment transition) Sources American Medical Association. “With Half of Rural Hospitals in Red, AMA Outlines Sustainable Path.” AMA, Nov. 2025, ama-assn.org/practice-management/payment-delivery-models/half-rural-hospitals-red-ama-outlines-sustainable-path.\nBipartisan Policy Center. “The Rural Emergency Hospital Model: Year Two Progress Report.” BPC, Oct. 2024, bipartisanpolicy.org/rural-emergency-hospital-2024.\nBourne, Donald S., et al. “Early Impacts of the Pennsylvania Rural Health Model on Potentially Avoidable Utilization.” Health Affairs Scholar, vol. 2, no. 2, 2024, doi:10.1093/haschl/qxae002.\nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services. “AHEAD (Achieving Healthcare Efficiency through Accountable Design) Model.” CMS Innovation Center, Sept. 2025, cms.gov/priorities/innovation/innovation-models/ahead.\nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services. “CMS Announces $50 Billion in Awards to Strengthen Rural Health in All 50 States.” CMS Newsroom, Dec. 2025, cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-announces-50-billion-awards-strengthen-rural-health-all-50-states.\nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services. “CMS Moves Closer to Accountable Care Goals with 2025 ACO Initiatives.” CMS Newsroom, Jan. 2025, cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/cms-moves-closer-accountable-care-goals-2025-aco-initiatives.\nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services. “Pennsylvania Rural Health Model.” CMS Innovation Center, Dec. 2024, cms.gov/priorities/innovation/innovation-models/pa-rural-health-model.\nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services. “Rural Emergency Hospitals.” CMS, Dec. 2025, cms.gov/medicare/health-safety-standards/certification-compliance/rural-emergency-hospitals.\nChartis Center for Rural Health. “2025 Rural Health State of the State.” Chartis, Feb. 2025, chartis.com/insights/2025-rural-health-state-state.\nChatterjee, Paula, et al. “Mixed Evidence That Rural Hospitals’ Finances Improved with Participation in the Pennsylvania Rural Health Model.” Health Affairs, vol. 44, no. 7, July 2025, doi:10.1377/hlthaff.2024.01559.\nHammond, Gracie, et al. “Year 1 of Medicare’s Accountable Care Organization Realizing Equity, Access, and Community Health Model.” JAMA Health Forum, vol. 6, no. 4, 2025, doi:10.1001/jamahealthforum.2025.0690.\nKaiser Family Foundation. “10 Things to Know About Rural Hospitals.” KFF, Sept. 2025, kff.org/health-costs/10-things-to-know-about-rural-hospitals.\nLong, Sharon K., et al. “Long-Term Spending of Accountable Care Organizations in the Medicare Shared Savings Program.” JAMA, vol. 333, no. 21, June 2025, doi:10.1001/jama.2025.6175.\nMedicare Payment Advisory Commission. “Exploring the Effect of Medicare Advantage on Rural Hospitals.” MedPAC, Apr. 2025, medpac.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Tab-F-MA-rural-quality-April-2025.pdf.\nNational Academy for State Health Policy. “Thinking Ahead on the AHEAD Model: Hospital Global Budgets.” NASHP, Nov. 2024, nashp.org/thinking-ahead-on-the-ahead-model-hospital-global-budgets.\nRural Health Information Hub. “Rural Emergency Hospitals (REHs) Overview.” RHI Hub, Oct. 2025, ruralhealthinfo.org/topics/rural-emergency-hospitals.\nRural Health Information Hub. “Testing New Approaches.” RHI Hub, Sept. 2025, ruralhealthinfo.org/new-approaches.\nSaving Rural Hospitals. “Cost of Rural Hospital Services.” Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform, 2025, ruralhospitals.chqpr.org/Costs.html.\nSaving Rural Hospitals. “The Causes of Rural Hospital Problems.” Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform, 2025, ruralhospitals.chqpr.org/Problems.html.\nRHTP 4.F: Payment Model Innovation Series 4: Transformation Approaches Rural Health Transformation Project Version 1: January 2026\n",

<p><em>What reimbursement sustains rural care?</em></p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#introduction">#</a></h2>
<p>Fee-for-service payment is fundamentally incompatible with rural healthcare delivery. This statement, while provocative, rests on arithmetic that rural hospital administrators confront daily. A hospital with <strong>high fixed costs and low patient volume</strong> cannot survive on per-service payments that fluctuate with demand. The emergency department must be staffed 24 hours regardless of whether five patients or fifty arrive. The lab technician earns the same salary whether running thirty tests or three hundred. The building depreciates at the same rate whether beds sit empty or full. When revenue depends on volume but costs remain constant, financial viability becomes a function of factors largely beyond administrative control.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Rural Health Model demonstrated what happens when rural hospitals receive predictable, prospective revenue instead of volume-dependent payments. <strong>All eighteen participating hospitals remained open through the COVID-19 pandemic</strong>, a period that devastated fee-for-service dependent facilities nationwide. Yet rigorous evaluation produced mixed evidence on financial improvement, with adjusted models showing nonsignificant margin increases. The model preserved access without demonstrating the transformative financial benefits advocates anticipated. This outcome, neither failure nor triumph, captures the complexity of rural payment reform.</p>
<p>RHTP applications invoke &ldquo;value-based payment&rdquo; with remarkable consistency. Nearly every state proposes transitioning rural providers toward alternative payment models. Yet the applications rarely engage with the evidence base, which reveals that <strong>standard value-based care approaches often fail in rural settings</strong>. The patient populations are too small for meaningful risk adjustment. The provider panels lack the volume to make shared savings arithmetic work. The quality measurement infrastructure that enables performance assessment in urban systems barely exists. States are proposing payment innovation for settings where the preconditions for that innovation are absent.</p>
<p>The core question for payment reform is not whether fee-for-service harms rural hospitals. The evidence on that point is unambiguous. <strong>The question is whether alternative payment models can be designed, implemented, and sustained in settings that systematically lack the characteristics associated with payment reform success.</strong> Rural areas need something different from the ACO models and bundled payments that have shown modest effects in larger systems. They need payment approaches built specifically for high-cost, low-volume, geographically isolated delivery environments. RHTP creates an opportunity to develop such approaches. Whether states seize that opportunity or simply apply urban payment reform templates to rural settings will determine whether payment innovation produces durable transformation or temporary experimentation.</p>
<h2 id="the-rural-context">The Rural Context<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-rural-context">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Low volume as financial poison.</strong> Rural healthcare operates at scale disadvantages that payment systems designed for metropolitan markets cannot address. A 25-bed Critical Access Hospital serving a county of 10,000 people cannot spread fixed costs across patient volume the way a 500-bed urban system can. The fundamental economics differ qualitatively, not just quantitatively. When patient volume drops by 10% at a large hospital, the organization adjusts staffing ratios and waits for the next surge. When volume drops 10% at a small rural hospital, the margin between survival and closure narrows.</p>
<p>The mechanics of <strong>CAH cost-based reimbursement</strong> illustrate both the protection Medicare provides rural facilities and its limitations. Medicare pays CAHs 101% of reasonable costs for inpatient and outpatient services, ensuring that Medicare patients do not generate losses. This cost-based approach insulates CAHs from the volume volatility that threatens other rural facilities. However, the protection applies only to Medicare. Private payers typically reimburse CAHs at rates similar to those paid to urban facilities, regardless of the higher per-unit costs rural facilities incur. Medicaid rates vary by state but generally fall below cost. The result: <strong>Medicare sustains CAHs while private payers and Medicaid erode that support.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Payer mix determines viability</strong> in ways payment reform rarely addresses. Rural populations skew older, making Medicare the dominant payer at most rural facilities. This concentration creates both stability (Medicare pays reliably) and vulnerability (Medicare rate changes disproportionately affect rural hospitals). Commercial insurance presence varies dramatically. Agricultural communities may have significant employer-sponsored coverage; retirement destinations may have almost none. Medicaid coverage depends on expansion status and state reimbursement policies. A rural hospital in expansion-state Minnesota operates in a fundamentally different financial environment than one in non-expansion Texas, regardless of their identical RHTP participation.</p>
<p><strong>Why value-based care math often fails rurally.</strong> Standard value-based payment models rest on assumptions that rural settings violate. Accountable care organizations require a minimum of 5,000 attributed Medicare beneficiaries to achieve statistical reliability in quality measurement and cost benchmarking. Many rural counties lack 5,000 total Medicare beneficiaries, let alone 5,000 who can be attributed to a single ACO. Shared savings models assume that coordinated care will reduce hospitalizations and emergency visits, generating savings to share. When the baseline utilization is already low (because patients defer care or travel elsewhere), the savings potential diminishes. Bundled payments assume sufficient procedure volume to absorb variation in individual case costs. A hospital performing twenty joint replacements annually cannot absorb the financial impact of one complex case the way a facility performing two hundred can.</p>
<p><strong>Attribution challenges compound the difficulty.</strong> Value-based models attribute patients to providers based on claims patterns. Rural patients often receive primary care locally and specialty care in distant urban centers. Attribution methodologies struggle with this split, sometimes attributing patients to urban specialists who see them once annually rather than rural primary care providers who see them quarterly. The ACO that ends up accountable for the patient may have little ability to influence their care. Cross-boundary patterns that seem logical from a patient perspective create accountability problems that payment models were not designed to address.</p>
<p><strong>Quality measurement capacity barely exists.</strong> Performance-based payment requires measuring performance. Large health systems maintain quality departments, employ data analysts, and invest in electronic health records capable of generating the measures CMS requires. Small rural hospitals often lack all three. The electronic health record at a 15-bed CAH may be adequate for clinical documentation but incapable of producing the quality reports ACO participation demands. A 2025 CMS finding that Shared Savings Program ACOs include over 10,000 FQHCs, RHCs, and CAHs represents growth, but participating rural facilities often depend on larger partners to handle the measurement and reporting infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>The RHTP payment innovation context.</strong> State applications propose value-based arrangements without acknowledging these constraints. Value-based care language appears in nearly every application, but specific payment model designs rarely reflect rural realities. The few applications that engage payment mechanics typically propose replicating urban models (ACOs, shared savings, care management fees) rather than developing rural-specific approaches. RHTP funding could support the infrastructure investment (data capacity, care coordination staff, quality measurement systems) that rural facilities need to participate in alternative payment models. Whether states invest in this infrastructure or simply add value-based care language to existing fee-for-service operations will determine payment reform outcomes.</p>

<h3 id="global-budget-evidence">Global Budget Evidence<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#global-budget-evidence">#</a></h3>
<p>The <strong>Pennsylvania Rural Health Model (PARHM)</strong> provides the most rigorous evidence on global budgets for rural hospitals. Operating from 2019 through 2024, PARHM paid eighteen rural hospitals prospective global budgets covering inpatient and outpatient services across all payers. Hospitals developed transformation plans and received predictable revenue regardless of volume fluctuations.</p>
<p>Outcomes assessment reveals both success and limitation. A 2024 Health Affairs Scholar study found early reductions in potentially avoidable utilization, consistent with the model&rsquo;s theory that global budgets would incentivize ambulatory care improvement. All eighteen hospitals remained operational through the pandemic, when fee-for-service dependent facilities faced devastating volume collapses. Hospital executives consistently report that budget predictability enabled planning and investment impossible under volume-dependent payment.</p>
<p><strong>However, rigorous financial evaluation produced mixed results.</strong> A July 2025 Health Affairs study using synthetic difference-in-differences methodology found that PARHM participation was associated with a <strong>4.5 percentage point increase in operating margins in unadjusted models</strong>. After adjustment for hospital characteristics and market factors, the improvement shrank to 3.0 percentage points and became statistically nonsignificant. Comparison with rural hospitals in five border states showed similar patterns. The authors concluded that global budgets alone may be insufficient to reverse rural hospital financial decline without broader community economic development and workforce investment.</p>
<p><strong>Maryland&rsquo;s Total Cost of Care model</strong> demonstrates global budgets at scale. Operating since 2014, Maryland&rsquo;s all-payer rate-setting system pays each hospital a predetermined annual revenue amount, with rates set by the Health Services Cost Review Commission. All payers, including Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial insurers, pay the same rates. Rigorous evaluation demonstrates significant Medicare savings and reduced readmissions compared to national trends.</p>
<p>The Maryland model&rsquo;s rural applicability is limited by several factors. First, Maryland has <strong>regulatory authority no other state possesses</strong>: the ability to set Medicare rates through federal waiver. Second, Maryland&rsquo;s rural areas are relatively proximate to Baltimore and Washington, unlike the isolated rural communities in larger states. Third, the infrastructure for all-payer rate-setting took decades to develop. States cannot replicate Maryland overnight.</p>
<h3 id="aco-evidence">ACO Evidence<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#aco-evidence">#</a></h3>
<p>The <strong>Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP)</strong> has generated the strongest evidence on accountable care. A June 2025 JAMA study using difference-in-differences methodology found that ACO formation was associated with mean differential reductions of <strong>$142 (1.2%) in annual per-patient spending over three years and $294 (2.4%) over six years</strong>. These results contrast with earlier Congressional Budget Office analyses suggesting minimal savings. The study attributed differences to its longer observation period, noting that savings increased over time as ACOs developed care coordination capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Rural ACO participation has grown but remains limited.</strong> CMS reports that the Shared Savings Program included 476 ACOs in 2025, with participation from 10,455 FQHCs, RHCs, and Critical Access Hospitals, a 16% increase from 2024. The Advance Investment Payment (AIP) program, providing upfront funding to new ACOs in rural and underserved areas, has attracted 28 participating ACOs, with half of attributed beneficiaries in rural or underserved communities.</p>
<p>However, the ACO REACH model targeting equity and access <strong>has not enrolled the intended population</strong>. A 2025 JAMA Health Forum cross-sectional analysis found that REACH beneficiaries were significantly less likely to be rural (3.9% vs. 8.4% in Medicare overall), less likely to reside in high-vulnerability areas, and more likely to be White than the broader Medicare population. The model designed to reduce rural health inequities has not reached rural populations at meaningful scale.</p>
<h3 id="rural-emergency-hospital-payment">Rural Emergency Hospital Payment<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#rural-emergency-hospital-payment">#</a></h3>
<p>The <strong>Rural Emergency Hospital (REH) designation</strong>, available since January 2023, offers an alternative payment pathway for struggling facilities. REHs receive 105% of standard OPPS rates for outpatient services plus a monthly facility payment (<strong>$285,626 in 2025</strong>), in exchange for eliminating inpatient services and maintaining 24/7 emergency care. As of October 2025, 42 hospitals have converted to REH status.</p>
<p>Conversion rates have been lower than projected. CMS initially estimated $408 million in REH payments for 2023; actual payments were approximately $30 million, reflecting the 19 facilities that converted (most in the second half of the year). Hospitals cite several barriers: loss of 340B drug pricing program eligibility, loss of swing bed revenue, unclear Medicaid reimbursement, and community resistance to losing inpatient services.</p>
<p><strong>The evidence on REH financial sustainability remains insufficient.</strong> The designation is too new for rigorous evaluation. Facilities that have converted report varying experiences. Some have achieved financial stability; others struggle with the monthly payment proving inadequate for their cost structures. The model assumes that communities can function without local inpatient care, an assumption communities themselves often reject.</p>
<h3 id="value-based-care-implementation-challenges">Value-Based Care Implementation Challenges<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#value-based-care-implementation-challenges">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>The AMA Council on Medical Service 2025 report</strong> documented the fundamental mismatch between value-based payment designs and rural realities. The council adopted policy supporting minimum standards for alternative payment models specific to rural hospitals:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Fixed-cost payment</strong>: Rural hospitals should receive predetermined amounts on predictable schedules not tied to volume</li>
<li><strong>Adequate payment rates</strong>: All payers must ensure payments cover full cost of care provision</li>
<li><strong>Reasonable patient cost-sharing</strong>: Out-of-pocket payments must be affordable</li>
<li><strong>Administrative simplicity</strong>: Models must minimize reporting and compliance burdens</li>
</ol>
<p>These standards implicitly acknowledge that existing value-based models fail to meet rural needs. The standards describe what payment reform should provide, not what current models actually deliver.</p>

<p>The <strong>AHEAD Model (Achieving Healthcare Efficiency through Accountable Design)</strong> represents CMS&rsquo;s current approach to state-based payment reform. Six states will participate: Maryland (Cohort 1), Connecticut, Hawaii, and Vermont (Cohort 2, performance beginning 2028), and Rhode Island and five New York counties (Cohort 3). The model runs through December 2035.</p>
<p>AHEAD requires participating states to meet total cost of care targets across Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial payers. Hospitals can participate in global budgets with population health accountability. Critical Access Hospitals receive special accommodations: delayed penalties for avoidable utilization, additional time in upside-only arrangements, and a payment floor based on most recent cost reports.</p>
<p><strong>September 2025 policy changes</strong> modified AHEAD significantly, extending timeline and adding geographic attribution for beneficiaries not attributed to other ACO programs. CMS will offer up to two additional states the opportunity to join in July 2026. The model&rsquo;s rural implications remain theoretical until performance data emerge.</p>
<h3 id="enhanced-payment-designations">Enhanced Payment Designations<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#enhanced-payment-designations">#</a></h3>
<p>Rural hospitals can access enhanced Medicare payments through several designations, each with distinct eligibility and benefit structures:</p>
<p><strong>Critical Access Hospital (CAH)</strong>: Cost-based reimbursement at 101% of reasonable costs for Medicare. Requires 25 or fewer beds, 35+ mile distance from next hospital (or state certification as necessary provider), and 96-hour average length of stay. Approximately 1,360 CAHs operate nationally.</p>
<p><strong>Sole Community Hospital (SCH)</strong>: Enhanced payment through either cost-based or prospective payment, whichever is higher. Must be 35+ miles from similar hospitals or meet geographic or travel time criteria. Provides payment protection during volume fluctuations.</p>
<p><strong>Medicare Dependent Hospital (MDH)</strong>: Additional payments for rural hospitals with 100 or fewer beds where Medicare inpatients exceed 60% of total. Provides cost-based floor similar to SCH.</p>
<p><strong>Low-Volume Hospital (LVH)</strong>: Payment adjustment for hospitals with fewer than 3,800 discharges annually and 15+ miles from similar facilities. Adjustment ranges from 25% at lowest volume to 0% at 3,800 discharges.</p>
<p>These designations provide meaningful payment support but do not address the fundamental fee-for-service volume dependence that threatens rural facilities. A CAH receiving cost-based Medicare payment still faces losses on private payers and Medicaid. A low-volume adjustment helps at the margin but cannot compensate for the structural disadvantages of small-scale operation.</p>

<h3 id="pennsylvanias-experience">Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Experience<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#pennsylvanias-experience">#</a></h3>
<p>The Pennsylvania Rural Health Model concluded December 2024 after six performance years. Eighteen hospitals participated, receiving global budgets that placed 75-90% of revenue under prospective payment. The Rural Health Care Redesign Center provided technical assistance and model administration.</p>
<p><strong>Accomplishments include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All participating hospitals remained open through COVID-19</li>
<li>Voluntary participation sustained throughout the model period</li>
<li>Hospital executives report improved planning capacity and investment ability</li>
<li>Early evidence of potentially avoidable utilization reduction</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Limitations revealed:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Financial improvement did not reach statistical significance in rigorous evaluation</li>
<li>Model required substantial federal investment and state administrative capacity</li>
<li>Global budgets alone proved insufficient without addressing workforce and economic development</li>
<li>Commercial payer participation remained limited despite all-payer design intent</li>
</ul>
<p>Pennsylvania&rsquo;s experience suggests that global budgets can preserve access and provide stability without necessarily transforming financial performance. The model&rsquo;s value may lie in preventing closure rather than generating profit.</p>
<h3 id="vermonts-all-payer-model">Vermont&rsquo;s All-Payer Model<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#vermonts-all-payer-model">#</a></h3>
<p>Vermont has operated an all-payer ACO model since 2017, with most hospitals participating voluntarily. The model holds OneCare Vermont, the state&rsquo;s ACO, accountable for total cost of care across Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial populations. Hospitals receive a mix of fee-for-service and fixed payments.</p>
<p><strong>The Vermont model demonstrates</strong> that small states with cooperative hospital relationships can implement population-based payment. However, Vermont&rsquo;s unique characteristics (small size, relatively homogeneous population, history of health reform experimentation) limit generalizability. Vermont will transition to AHEAD in 2028, providing an opportunity to test whether the federal framework can support state-specific approaches.</p>
<h3 id="marylands-transition">Maryland&rsquo;s Transition<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#marylands-transition">#</a></h3>
<p>Maryland&rsquo;s all-payer system, operating since the 1970s, will transition to AHEAD beginning January 2026. The transition raises questions about whether the federal framework can accommodate Maryland&rsquo;s regulatory infrastructure or whether AHEAD&rsquo;s standardized approach will constrain Maryland&rsquo;s flexibility.</p>
<p><strong>For rural areas specifically</strong>, the transition introduces uncertainty. Maryland&rsquo;s Eastern Shore hospitals have operated under global budgets with predictable revenue for decades. The AHEAD model&rsquo;s quality requirements and cost growth targets may impose new performance pressures. Whether AHEAD preserves the financial stability Maryland&rsquo;s rural hospitals have achieved remains to be seen.</p>

<h3 id="value-based-care-language-prevalence">Value-Based Care Language Prevalence<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#value-based-care-language-prevalence">#</a></h3>
<p>Virtually every RHTP application includes value-based payment proposals. The language varies:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Texas</strong> proposes &ldquo;alternative payment model readiness&rdquo; without specifying which models</li>
<li><strong>California</strong> plans value-based payment evaluation and rural payment model landscape assessment</li>
<li><strong>North Carolina</strong> targets &ldquo;rural provider transition to value-based payment&rdquo; with primary care capitation pilots</li>
<li><strong>Ohio</strong> references innovation hubs creating &ldquo;value-based payment arrangements&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-applications-lack">What Applications Lack<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-applications-lack">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Realistic timelines</strong>: Payment model transitions require years of preparation. Provider contracting, actuarial analysis, quality measurement infrastructure, and care management capacity cannot be built within RHTP&rsquo;s two-year obligation window. Applications proposing value-based transformation by 2027 or 2028 underestimate implementation requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Infrastructure acknowledgment</strong>: Successful payment reform requires data analytics capacity, care coordination staffing, quality measurement systems, and provider engagement processes. Few applications detail how RHTP funding will build this infrastructure rather than simply declaring value-based care intent.</p>
<p><strong>Payer participation strategies</strong>: Medicare alternative payment models exist. The challenge for states is engaging Medicaid managed care organizations and commercial payers. Applications rarely address how states will secure payer participation beyond Medicare demonstrations already available.</p>
<p><strong>Rural-specific design</strong>: Applications frequently propose extending urban payment models (ACOs, bundled payments, performance bonuses) to rural settings without addressing the volume, attribution, and measurement limitations that cause these models to fail rurally. Genuinely rural-specific payment approaches remain rare.</p>
<h3 id="promising-elements">Promising Elements<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#promising-elements">#</a></h3>
<p>Some applications demonstrate more sophisticated payment thinking:</p>
<p><strong>California&rsquo;s Transformative Payments</strong> provide upfront infrastructure funding not tied to service volume, acknowledging that rural facilities need investment capital before they can succeed in performance-based arrangements.</p>
<p><strong>North Carolina&rsquo;s primary care capitation pilots</strong> test whether prospective payment can stabilize rural primary care before expanding to broader population-based models.</p>
<p><strong>Vermont&rsquo;s AHEAD participation</strong> builds on existing all-payer experience, potentially demonstrating how federal frameworks can accommodate state innovation.</p>
<h2 id="implementation-reality">Implementation Reality<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#implementation-reality">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="multi-payer-alignment-challenges">Multi-Payer Alignment Challenges<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#multi-payer-alignment-challenges">#</a></h3>
<p>Global budgets and total cost of care models require participation across payers to succeed. Medicare participation alone, while valuable, leaves hospitals exposed to fee-for-service volatility from commercial and Medicaid revenue. Pennsylvania&rsquo;s experience demonstrates the difficulty: despite &ldquo;all-payer&rdquo; design, commercial participation remained limited.</p>
<p><strong>Securing commercial payer participation</strong> requires either regulatory authority (Maryland&rsquo;s unique position), market leverage (which rural hospitals lack), or financial incentives sufficient to overcome insurers&rsquo; preference for fee-for-service payment in low-negotiating-power markets. States cannot simply declare all-payer participation and expect insurers to comply.</p>
<p><strong>Medicaid alignment</strong> depends on state Medicaid agency capacity and managed care organization cooperation. States with fully managed Medicaid programs can potentially require MCO participation in state payment initiatives. States with fragmented Medicaid landscapes face coordination challenges across multiple managed care contracts.</p>
<h3 id="administrative-capacity-requirements">Administrative Capacity Requirements<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#administrative-capacity-requirements">#</a></h3>
<p>Payment reform demands administrative infrastructure that many states lack:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Actuarial expertise</strong> for setting global budgets and benchmarks</li>
<li><strong>Data systems</strong> capable of tracking total cost of care across payers</li>
<li><strong>Quality measurement infrastructure</strong> for performance assessment</li>
<li><strong>Provider engagement capacity</strong> for negotiating participation and monitoring compliance</li>
<li><strong>Technical assistance resources</strong> for helping rural facilities adapt to new payment models</li>
</ul>
<p>RHTP could fund this infrastructure, but applications often allocate minimal resources to administrative capacity. States proposing ambitious payment reform with single-digit-percentage administrative budgets are likely underestimating implementation requirements.</p>
<h3 id="political-sustainability">Political Sustainability<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#political-sustainability">#</a></h3>
<p>Payment models that constrain revenue growth face political vulnerability. When hospitals argue that global budgets are inadequate, legislators hear from constituents worried about local facility closure. The Pennsylvania model survived six years through bipartisan support and hospital satisfaction with budget predictability. Not all states will achieve similar political consensus.</p>
<p><strong>The 2030 cliff</strong> compounds political risk. RHTP-supported payment initiatives must transition to sustainable financing by program sunset. If payment reform depends on continued federal subsidy, post-2030 sustainability requires either ongoing federal commitment (uncertain) or sufficient state resources to maintain reform infrastructure (unlikely in many states).</p>
<h2 id="the-2030-question">The 2030 Question<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-2030-question">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="payment-reform-as-infrastructure-vs-pilot">Payment Reform as Infrastructure vs. Pilot<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#payment-reform-as-infrastructure-vs-pilot">#</a></h3>
<p>The fundamental question for payment innovation is whether RHTP supports durable infrastructure change or temporary experimentation. Pilot programs that end when federal funding ends produce learning but not transformation. Permanent payment reform requires changes in law, regulation, and payer relationships that survive political transitions.</p>
<p><strong>Durable approaches</strong> include:</p>
<ul>
<li>State Medicaid plan amendments institutionalizing alternative payment methods</li>
<li>Regulatory frameworks enabling all-payer rate-setting or global budget authority</li>
<li>Commercial payer contracts with multi-year value-based payment commitments</li>
<li>Provider capacity investments (data systems, care coordination staff) that persist beyond grant periods</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Temporary approaches</strong> include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time-limited demonstration projects without path to permanent authority</li>
<li>Payment pilots dependent on continued federal funding</li>
<li>Value-based arrangements that revert to fee-for-service when grants end</li>
<li>Infrastructure investments that cannot be maintained without ongoing subsidy</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="whether-alternative-payments-survive-political-transitions">Whether Alternative Payments Survive Political Transitions<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#whether-alternative-payments-survive-political-transitions">#</a></h3>
<p>Maryland&rsquo;s payment system has survived both Republican and Democratic administrations for fifty years because the regulatory infrastructure became embedded in state government operations. Pennsylvania&rsquo;s model ended when the federal demonstration period concluded. The difference lies not in policy merit but in institutional durability.</p>
<p><strong>RHTP payment initiatives face uncertain political futures.</strong> The Trump administration has signaled interest in revising the Maryland agreement, potentially constraining the nation&rsquo;s most successful hospital payment reform. AHEAD model changes announced in September 2025 extended timelines but also raised questions about federal commitment to state flexibility. States building payment reform on RHTP foundations must consider whether those foundations will persist after political change.</p>
<h3 id="the-medicaid-cut-interaction">The Medicaid Cut Interaction<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-medicaid-cut-interaction">#</a></h3>
<p>Payment reform assumes stable underlying coverage. Projected $911 billion in Medicaid cuts over ten years would fundamentally alter the financial environment in which payment reform operates. Global budgets calculated on current payer mix become unreliable when Medicaid coverage changes. Value-based arrangements designed for current beneficiary populations require recalibration when populations lose coverage.</p>
<p><strong>Rural areas face disproportionate Medicaid cut exposure.</strong> Medicaid covers 25% of rural residents under 65 and 22% of dually eligible individuals. Coverage reductions concentrate in states with non-expansion Medicaid and high uninsured rates, which overlap substantially with states having vulnerable rural hospital infrastructure. Payment reform cannot succeed if the underlying coverage infrastructure collapses.</p>

<h3 id="build-infrastructure-before-reform">Build Infrastructure Before Reform<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#build-infrastructure-before-reform">#</a></h3>
<p>Payment transformation requires capacity that most rural providers lack. States should sequence RHTP investments to build infrastructure first:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Data systems</strong>: Electronic health record upgrades, health information exchange participation, quality reporting capability</li>
<li><strong>Care coordination</strong>: Care managers, social workers, and community health workers who can execute population health strategies</li>
<li><strong>Administrative capacity</strong>: Staff trained in value-based contracting, performance measurement, and financial modeling</li>
<li><strong>Provider engagement</strong>: Relationships and trust enabling collaborative payment redesign</li>
</ol>
<p>Attempting payment reform without this infrastructure produces participation in name only, where providers sign value-based contracts but lack capacity to change care delivery.</p>
<h3 id="design-for-rural-realities">Design for Rural Realities<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#design-for-rural-realities">#</a></h3>
<p>Standard value-based models require modification for rural application:</p>
<p><strong>Adjust attribution methodologies</strong> to account for split care patterns. Rural patients receiving primary care locally and specialty care distantly need attribution approaches that credit local providers appropriately.</p>
<p><strong>Aggregate risk pools</strong> across multiple small providers. Individual rural facilities cannot bear population-based risk, but regional groupings may achieve sufficient scale for meaningful risk-sharing.</p>
<p><strong>Simplify quality measurement</strong> to reduce administrative burden. Rural facilities cannot maintain the quality reporting infrastructure large systems develop. Streamlined measure sets focusing on the most clinically meaningful indicators reduce burden while preserving accountability.</p>
<p><strong>Provide upside opportunity before downside risk</strong>. Rural facilities operating on negative margins cannot absorb losses from failed performance. Payment models should offer savings potential before imposing penalty risk.</p>
<h3 id="pursue-global-budget-approaches">Pursue Global Budget Approaches<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#pursue-global-budget-approaches">#</a></h3>
<p>The evidence, while mixed, supports global budgets as the payment approach most compatible with rural healthcare economics. Fixed prospective payment addresses the fundamental volume dependence that fee-for-service creates. Pennsylvania&rsquo;s experience demonstrates that global budgets can preserve access even when financial transformation proves modest.</p>
<p>States should explore AHEAD participation for state-level global budget authority. States not positioned for AHEAD should seek federal demonstration opportunities or develop state-funded global budget pilots.</p>
<h3 id="engage-payers-strategically">Engage Payers Strategically<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#engage-payers-strategically">#</a></h3>
<p>Medicare alternative payment models provide a foundation but not a complete solution. States should:</p>
<p><strong>Leverage Medicaid managed care</strong> contracting authority to require MCO participation in state payment initiatives. Contract requirements can compel alignment that voluntary approaches cannot achieve.</p>
<p><strong>Develop business cases</strong> for commercial payer participation. Insurers will participate in rural payment reform when they perceive financial benefit. Demonstrating that value-based arrangements reduce costs or administrative burden can motivate engagement.</p>
<p><strong>Coordinate across programs</strong> to reduce provider burden. Multiple value-based contracts with different requirements, measures, and timelines overwhelm rural providers. Aligned approaches across payers simplify participation.</p>
<h3 id="plan-for-post-2030-sustainability">Plan for Post-2030 Sustainability<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#plan-for-post-2030-sustainability">#</a></h3>
<p>Every payment initiative should include explicit sustainability planning:</p>
<ul>
<li>What regulatory or statutory changes are required for permanent implementation?</li>
<li>What ongoing administrative costs will the state bear after federal funding ends?</li>
<li>What payer commitments extend beyond the RHTP period?</li>
<li>What provider capacity investments will persist without continued subsidy?</li>
</ul>
<p>Initiatives that cannot answer these questions are pilots, not transformation.</p>
