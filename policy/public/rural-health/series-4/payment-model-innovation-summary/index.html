  "articleBody": "The arithmetic of rural healthcare delivery exposes a fundamental incompatibility between fee-for-service payment and the realities of high fixed costs spread across low patient volumes. When an emergency department must maintain 24-hour staffing regardless of patient flow, when lab technicians draw the same salary whether processing thirty tests or three hundred, when building depreciation proceeds at identical rates whether beds are full or empty, revenue tied to volume becomes a path to closure rather than sustainability. This mathematical reality confronts every rural hospital administrator, yet RHTP applications overwhelmingly propose payment reforms designed for metropolitan markets where volume fluctuations affect profit margins rather than survival prospects.\nPennsylvania’s Rural Health Model demonstrated what happens when rural hospitals receive predictable prospective revenue instead of volume-dependent payments. All eighteen participating hospitals remained open through the COVID-19 pandemic, a period when fee-for-service dependent facilities across the country faced devastating volume collapses. Hospital executives consistently reported that budget predictability enabled planning and investment impossible under traditional payment. However, rigorous July 2025 evaluation using synthetic difference-in-differences methodology revealed that while unadjusted models showed a 4.5 percentage point operating margin increase, adjustment for hospital characteristics and market factors reduced this to 3.0 percentage points and eliminated statistical significance. The Pennsylvania experience suggests that global budgets preserve access without necessarily transforming financial performance, a finding that captures the complexity of rural payment reform rather than delivering either triumph or failure.\nNearly every RHTP application invokes value-based payment with remarkable consistency, yet these proposals rarely engage the evidence base showing that standard approaches systematically fail in rural settings. Accountable care organizations require minimum attributed populations of 5,000 Medicare beneficiaries to achieve statistical reliability in quality measurement and cost benchmarking. Many rural counties lack 5,000 total Medicare beneficiaries, rendering ACO participation mathematically impossible. Shared savings models assume coordinated care will reduce hospitalizations and emergency visits, generating savings to distribute, but when baseline utilization is already low because patients defer care or travel elsewhere, the savings potential diminishes. Bundled payments assume sufficient procedure volume to absorb variation in individual case costs, yet a hospital performing twenty joint replacements annually cannot absorb one complex case the way a facility performing two hundred can. The patient populations are too small for meaningful risk adjustment, the provider panels lack volume to make shared savings arithmetic work, and the quality measurement infrastructure enabling performance assessment in urban systems barely exists rurally.\nCritical Access Hospital cost-based reimbursement illustrates both the protection Medicare provides and its inherent limitations. Medicare pays CAHs 101 percent of reasonable costs for inpatient and outpatient services, ensuring Medicare patients generate no losses. This insulation from volume volatility protects approximately 1,360 facilities nationwide. However, protection applies only to Medicare. Private payers typically reimburse CAHs at rates similar to urban facilities regardless of higher per-unit costs rural facilities incur. Medicaid rates vary by state but generally fall below cost. Medicare sustains CAHs while private payers and Medicaid erode that support, creating a financial structure where payer mix determines viability in ways payment reform rarely addresses. Rural populations skew older, making Medicare the dominant payer at most facilities. This concentration creates both stability through reliable Medicare payment and vulnerability when Medicare rate changes disproportionately affect rural hospitals.\nAttribution challenges compound the difficulty of applying standard value-based models to rural settings. Rural patients often receive primary care locally and specialty care in distant urban centers. Attribution methodologies based on claims patterns struggle with this split, sometimes assigning patients to urban specialists seen once annually rather than rural primary care providers seen quarterly. The accountable care organization assigned responsibility may have minimal ability to influence care for patients it supposedly manages. Cross-boundary patterns that make sense from patient perspectives create accountability problems payment models were not designed to address. Meanwhile, quality measurement capacity barely exists at facilities where electronic health records may be adequate for clinical documentation but incapable of producing the quality reports ACO participation demands. Large health systems employ dedicated quality departments and data analysts. Small rural hospitals often lack both.\nA 2025 CMS finding that Shared Savings Program ACOs include over 10,000 FQHCs, RHCs, and CAHs represents growth, yet participating rural facilities typically depend on larger partners to handle measurement and reporting infrastructure. The AMA Council on Medical Service 2025 report documented this fundamental mismatch by establishing minimum standards for rural alternative payment models: fixed-cost payment not tied to volume, adequate rates ensuring payments cover full care costs, reasonable patient cost-sharing, and administrative simplicity minimizing reporting burdens. These standards implicitly acknowledge that existing value-based models fail rural needs, describing what payment reform should provide rather than what current arrangements actually deliver.\nThe evidence base on specific payment models reveals both promise and limitation. Maryland’s Total Cost of Care model, operating since 2014 with all-payer rate-setting authority no other state possesses, demonstrates significant Medicare savings and reduced readmissions compared to national trends. However, Maryland’s rural areas are relatively proximate to Baltimore and Washington, unlike isolated communities in larger states, and the infrastructure for all-payer rate-setting took decades to develop. States cannot replicate Maryland overnight. The Medicare Shared Savings Program has generated strong evidence, with a June 2025 JAMA study finding that ACO formation produced mean differential spending reductions of $142 (1.2 percent) annually over three years and $294 (2.4 percent) over six years. These results contrast with earlier Congressional Budget Office analyses suggesting minimal savings, with researchers attributing differences to longer observation periods showing savings increase as ACOs develop care coordination capabilities.\nRural ACO participation has grown but targets remain elusive. While MSSP included 476 ACOs in 2025 with participation from 10,455 FQHCs, RHCs, and CAHs, a 16 percent increase from 2024, the ACO REACH model specifically designed to target equity and access has not enrolled the intended population. A 2025 JAMA Health Forum analysis found REACH beneficiaries were significantly less likely to be rural (3.9 percent versus 8.4 percent in Medicare overall), less likely to reside in high-vulnerability areas, and more likely to be White than the broader Medicare population. The model designed to reduce rural health inequities has not reached rural populations at meaningful scale.\nThe Rural Emergency Hospital designation available since January 2023 offers an alternative pathway for struggling facilities, providing 105 percent of standard outpatient rates plus a monthly facility payment of $285,626 in 2025 in exchange for eliminating inpatient services while maintaining 24-hour emergency care. As of October 2025, 42 hospitals have converted to REH status, far below initial projections. CMS estimated $408 million in REH payments for 2023; actual payments were approximately $30 million. Hospitals cite multiple barriers: loss of 340B drug pricing eligibility, loss of swing bed revenue, unclear Medicaid reimbursement, and community resistance to losing inpatient services. The designation assumes communities can function without local inpatient care, an assumption communities themselves often reject, and evidence on financial sustainability remains insufficient given the model’s novelty.\nThe AHEAD Model (Achieving Healthcare Efficiency through Accountable Design) represents CMS’s current approach to state-based payment reform, with six states participating through December 2035: Maryland beginning 2026, Connecticut, Hawaii, and Vermont beginning 2028, and Rhode Island and five New York counties in Cohort 3. AHEAD requires participating states to meet total cost of care targets across Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial payers while hospitals can participate in global budgets with population health accountability. Critical Access Hospitals receive special accommodations including delayed penalties for avoidable utilization, additional time in upside-only arrangements, and payment floors based on most recent cost reports. September 2025 policy changes extended timelines and added geographic attribution for beneficiaries not attributed to other programs, yet the model’s rural implications remain theoretical until performance data emerge.\nState RHTP applications demonstrate both the ubiquity and limitations of value-based payment thinking. Texas proposes “alternative payment model readiness” without specifying which models. California plans value-based payment evaluation and rural payment model landscape assessment. North Carolina targets “rural provider transition to value-based payment” with primary care capitation pilots. Ohio references innovation hubs creating “value-based payment arrangements.” What applications consistently lack are realistic timelines acknowledging that payment model transitions require years of preparation, infrastructure acknowledgment detailing how RHTP funding will build data analytics capacity and quality measurement systems rather than simply declaring value-based care intent, payer participation strategies addressing how states will engage Medicaid managed care organizations and commercial insurers beyond already-available Medicare demonstrations, and rural-specific design rather than extending urban models that fail when volume, attribution, and measurement limitations manifest.\nMulti-payer alignment presents formidable challenges that Pennsylvania’s experience illuminates. Despite “all-payer” design intent, commercial participation remained limited. Medicare participation alone leaves hospitals exposed to fee-for-service volatility from commercial and Medicaid revenue\n",

<div class="post-content">
<p>The arithmetic of rural healthcare delivery exposes a fundamental incompatibility between fee-for-service payment and the realities of high fixed costs spread across low patient volumes. When an emergency department must maintain 24-hour staffing regardless of patient flow, when lab technicians draw the same salary whether processing thirty tests or three hundred, when building depreciation proceeds at identical rates whether beds are full or empty, <strong>revenue tied to volume becomes a path to closure rather than sustainability</strong>. This mathematical reality confronts every rural hospital administrator, yet RHTP applications overwhelmingly propose payment reforms designed for metropolitan markets where volume fluctuations affect profit margins rather than survival prospects.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Rural Health Model demonstrated what happens when rural hospitals receive predictable prospective revenue instead of volume-dependent payments. All eighteen participating hospitals remained open through the COVID-19 pandemic, a period when fee-for-service dependent facilities across the country faced devastating volume collapses. Hospital executives consistently reported that budget predictability enabled planning and investment impossible under traditional payment. However, rigorous July 2025 evaluation using synthetic difference-in-differences methodology revealed that while unadjusted models showed a 4.5 percentage point operating margin increase, adjustment for hospital characteristics and market factors reduced this to 3.0 percentage points and eliminated statistical significance. The Pennsylvania experience suggests that <strong>global budgets preserve access without necessarily transforming financial performance</strong>, a finding that captures the complexity of rural payment reform rather than delivering either triumph or failure.</p>
<p>Nearly every RHTP application invokes value-based payment with remarkable consistency, yet these proposals rarely engage the evidence base showing that standard approaches systematically fail in rural settings. Accountable care organizations require minimum attributed populations of 5,000 Medicare beneficiaries to achieve statistical reliability in quality measurement and cost benchmarking. Many rural counties lack 5,000 total Medicare beneficiaries, rendering ACO participation mathematically impossible. Shared savings models assume coordinated care will reduce hospitalizations and emergency visits, generating savings to distribute, but when baseline utilization is already low because patients defer care or travel elsewhere, the savings potential diminishes. Bundled payments assume sufficient procedure volume to absorb variation in individual case costs, yet a hospital performing twenty joint replacements annually cannot absorb one complex case the way a facility performing two hundred can. The patient populations are too small for meaningful risk adjustment, the provider panels lack volume to make shared savings arithmetic work, and the quality measurement infrastructure enabling performance assessment in urban systems barely exists rurally.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Access Hospital cost-based reimbursement</strong> illustrates both the protection Medicare provides and its inherent limitations. Medicare pays CAHs 101 percent of reasonable costs for inpatient and outpatient services, ensuring Medicare patients generate no losses. This insulation from volume volatility protects approximately 1,360 facilities nationwide. However, protection applies only to Medicare. Private payers typically reimburse CAHs at rates similar to urban facilities regardless of higher per-unit costs rural facilities incur. Medicaid rates vary by state but generally fall below cost. Medicare sustains CAHs while private payers and Medicaid erode that support, creating a financial structure where payer mix determines viability in ways payment reform rarely addresses. Rural populations skew older, making Medicare the dominant payer at most facilities. This concentration creates both stability through reliable Medicare payment and vulnerability when Medicare rate changes disproportionately affect rural hospitals.</p>
<p>Attribution challenges compound the difficulty of applying standard value-based models to rural settings. Rural patients often receive primary care locally and specialty care in distant urban centers. Attribution methodologies based on claims patterns struggle with this split, sometimes assigning patients to urban specialists seen once annually rather than rural primary care providers seen quarterly. The accountable care organization assigned responsibility may have minimal ability to influence care for patients it supposedly manages. Cross-boundary patterns that make sense from patient perspectives create accountability problems payment models were not designed to address. Meanwhile, <strong>quality measurement capacity barely exists</strong> at facilities where electronic health records may be adequate for clinical documentation but incapable of producing the quality reports ACO participation demands. Large health systems employ dedicated quality departments and data analysts. Small rural hospitals often lack both.</p>
<p>A 2025 CMS finding that Shared Savings Program ACOs include over 10,000 FQHCs, RHCs, and CAHs represents growth, yet participating rural facilities typically depend on larger partners to handle measurement and reporting infrastructure. The AMA Council on Medical Service 2025 report documented this fundamental mismatch by establishing minimum standards for rural alternative payment models: fixed-cost payment not tied to volume, adequate rates ensuring payments cover full care costs, reasonable patient cost-sharing, and administrative simplicity minimizing reporting burdens. These standards implicitly acknowledge that existing value-based models fail rural needs, describing what payment reform should provide rather than what current arrangements actually deliver.</p>
<p>The evidence base on specific payment models reveals both promise and limitation. Maryland&rsquo;s Total Cost of Care model, operating since 2014 with all-payer rate-setting authority no other state possesses, demonstrates significant Medicare savings and reduced readmissions compared to national trends. However, Maryland&rsquo;s rural areas are relatively proximate to Baltimore and Washington, unlike isolated communities in larger states, and the infrastructure for all-payer rate-setting took decades to develop. States cannot replicate Maryland overnight. The Medicare Shared Savings Program has generated strong evidence, with a June 2025 JAMA study finding that ACO formation produced mean differential spending reductions of $142 (1.2 percent) annually over three years and $294 (2.4 percent) over six years. These results contrast with earlier Congressional Budget Office analyses suggesting minimal savings, with researchers attributing differences to longer observation periods showing savings increase as ACOs develop care coordination capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Rural ACO participation has grown but targets remain elusive.</strong> While MSSP included 476 ACOs in 2025 with participation from 10,455 FQHCs, RHCs, and CAHs, a 16 percent increase from 2024, the ACO REACH model specifically designed to target equity and access has not enrolled the intended population. A 2025 JAMA Health Forum analysis found REACH beneficiaries were significantly less likely to be rural (3.9 percent versus 8.4 percent in Medicare overall), less likely to reside in high-vulnerability areas, and more likely to be White than the broader Medicare population. The model designed to reduce rural health inequities has not reached rural populations at meaningful scale.</p>
<p>The Rural Emergency Hospital designation available since January 2023 offers an alternative pathway for struggling facilities, providing 105 percent of standard outpatient rates plus a monthly facility payment of $285,626 in 2025 in exchange for eliminating inpatient services while maintaining 24-hour emergency care. As of October 2025, 42 hospitals have converted to REH status, far below initial projections. CMS estimated $408 million in REH payments for 2023; actual payments were approximately $30 million. Hospitals cite multiple barriers: loss of 340B drug pricing eligibility, loss of swing bed revenue, unclear Medicaid reimbursement, and community resistance to losing inpatient services. The designation assumes communities can function without local inpatient care, an assumption communities themselves often reject, and evidence on financial sustainability remains insufficient given the model&rsquo;s novelty.</p>
<p>The AHEAD Model (Achieving Healthcare Efficiency through Accountable Design) represents CMS&rsquo;s current approach to state-based payment reform, with six states participating through December 2035: Maryland beginning 2026, Connecticut, Hawaii, and Vermont beginning 2028, and Rhode Island and five New York counties in Cohort 3. AHEAD requires participating states to meet total cost of care targets across Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial payers while hospitals can participate in global budgets with population health accountability. <strong>Critical Access Hospitals receive special accommodations</strong> including delayed penalties for avoidable utilization, additional time in upside-only arrangements, and payment floors based on most recent cost reports. September 2025 policy changes extended timelines and added geographic attribution for beneficiaries not attributed to other programs, yet the model&rsquo;s rural implications remain theoretical until performance data emerge.</p>
<p>State RHTP applications demonstrate both the ubiquity and limitations of value-based payment thinking. Texas proposes &ldquo;alternative payment model readiness&rdquo; without specifying which models. California plans value-based payment evaluation and rural payment model landscape assessment. North Carolina targets &ldquo;rural provider transition to value-based payment&rdquo; with primary care capitation pilots. Ohio references innovation hubs creating &ldquo;value-based payment arrangements.&rdquo; What applications consistently lack are realistic timelines acknowledging that payment model transitions require years of preparation, infrastructure acknowledgment detailing how RHTP funding will build data analytics capacity and quality measurement systems rather than simply declaring value-based care intent, payer participation strategies addressing how states will engage Medicaid managed care organizations and commercial insurers beyond already-available Medicare demonstrations, and rural-specific design rather than extending urban models that fail when volume, attribution, and measurement limitations manifest.</p>
<p><strong>Multi-payer alignment presents formidable challenges</strong> that Pennsylvania&rsquo;s experience illuminates. Despite &ldquo;all-payer&rdquo; design intent, commercial participation remained limited. Medicare participation alone leaves hospitals exposed to fee-for-service volatility from commercial and Medicaid revenue</p>
