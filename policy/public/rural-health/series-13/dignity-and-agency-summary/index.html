  "articleBody": "Helen Caudill sat through the Louisville consultant’s PowerPoint presentation about Letcher County, watching her community reduced to statistics on barriers and deficits. After seventy-three years living there and forty years helping neighbors navigate systems designed without them in mind, she recognized the pattern immediately. “They come to fix us,” she told her daughter afterward. “They do not come to help us.” Her distinction, between being fixed and being helped, captures what happens when $50 billion in rural health transformation meets communities already navigating $911 billion in simultaneous Medicaid cuts. The difference is not semantic. Help honors the person being helped, asks what they need, respects their judgment, expands their options, preserves their agency. Fixing treats people as problems, diagnoses deficits, prescribes solutions, measures compliance, judges success by whether the fixed person now resembles what fixers intended. The RHTP operates predominantly in fixing mode, and the cost of that choice extends beyond wounded feelings into questions of whether transformation can succeed at all.\nDeficit framing pervades how external institutions perceive and describe rural communities. Grant applications document needs and problems to justify funding. Research studies measure disparities to demonstrate the case for intervention. Policy briefs compile what rural America lacks: fewer physicians, higher mortality, lower income, less education, more chronic disease. The framing is not false. The disparities exist, the needs are real. But when communities are defined by their problems, interventions target those problems and the community becomes the object of intervention rather than a participant in determining what intervention should look like. Decades of being described as deficient, backward, left behind produces internalized narratives that constrain imagination. Young people absorb that their communities have no future and leave. Remaining residents absorb that they are problems awaiting solution and either accept solutions that do not serve them or reject engagement entirely. The framing shapes both what solutions look like and how communities see themselves.\nExpert imposition flows naturally from deficit framing. Problems identified through external analysis require solutions developed through external expertise, a logic that appears throughout transformation. State agencies design programs based on evidence from research conducted elsewhere. Technical assistance providers from national organizations advise on implementation strategies developed for different contexts. Consultants with credentials but no local knowledge prescribe practices that worked in settings unlike the ones where they now recommend them. “Evidence-based” has become a term that often means “developed and tested elsewhere.” The evidence base for rural health interventions remains thin, with most research conducted in urban or suburban settings. Applying findings from those settings to rural contexts assumes transferability that may not exist. What worked in Cleveland may not work in Harlan, not because Harlan resists evidence but because the contexts differ in ways the evidence did not examine.\nOutcome attribution compounds the dignity problem through a consistent pattern: when transformation efforts succeed, success is credited to the program, the intervention, the external expertise that guided implementation. When transformation efforts fail, failure is attributed to the community—they were resistant, noncompliant, not ready to change, lacking capacity, unwilling to engage. This attribution pattern appears explicitly in program evaluations and implicitly in how transformation is discussed. Communities become responsible for implementing programs designed without their input, then bear blame when programs do not achieve outcomes determined by external metrics. Agency in design flows to experts, accountability for outcomes flows to communities. The asymmetry is not accidental but structural, embedded in how transformation operates.\nPaternalism operates through assumptions about what communities need that may not align with what communities want. The assumption that healthcare transformation should prioritize clinical quality metrics presumes that communities share that priority. The assumption that workforce development should emphasize credentialing presumes that communities value credentials over relationships. The assumption that technology deployment improves care presumes that communities experience technology as improvement. Paternalism does not require malice or condescension. Well-intentioned actors genuinely believe they know what communities need and act accordingly. The problem is not bad faith but the presumption that external knowledge supersedes local knowledge about local conditions and local values.\nThe first meeting between the rural health transformation planning committee and community members in Carroll County, Kentucky went poorly. The planning committee, composed of state agency staff, hospital administrators, and technical assistance consultants, presented a draft plan developed over months without community input. The plan was evidence-based, aligned with RHTP priorities, responsive to regional health data showing elevated rates of chronic disease and behavioral health needs. Rita Begley, who had organized community health events in Carroll County for fifteen years, asked why the community was learning about the plan at a presentation rather than helping develop it. The planning committee chair explained that community engagement was happening now, at this meeting, where feedback was welcome. “Feedback on your plan is not the same as involvement in making a plan,” Begley said. “You have already decided what we need. Now you want us to say we agree.”\nThe tension reflected competing views of community engagement. The planning committee believed they had engaged appropriately: they analyzed data, reviewed evidence, developed a plan designed to address identified needs, and brought that plan to the community for response. Community members believed engagement required something different: being present when needs were identified, when options were considered, when trade-offs were weighed. The planning committee had expertise about RHTP requirements, evidence on effective interventions, and technical capacity to develop fundable applications. Community members had different expertise: knowledge of their own circumstances, understanding of local dynamics, awareness of what previous interventions had attempted and why they failed or succeeded. Neither expertise was sufficient alone. The planning committee’s plan reflected evidence from elsewhere applied to a community they did not know. Community members’ objections reflected experience that shaped receptivity to external intervention.\nSix months later, a reconstituted planning process produced different results. Community members participated from the beginning, identifying what they saw as priority concerns (transportation, behavioral health, prescription costs) that differed somewhat from what data analysis had highlighted. Technical experts contributed knowledge about what interventions had evidence, what funding would support, what implementation required. The resulting plan reflected both perspectives, imperfectly merged but genuinely collaborative. Rita Begley chaired the community advisory committee for the revised plan, acknowledging that the plan was not what she would have designed alone, just as it was not what the state agency would have designed alone. “But it is ours,” she said. “We made it together. When it works, we did that. When it struggles, we have to fix it together.” The difference she described was ownership, which is another word for agency. Plans developed through partnership belong to those who developed them. Plans developed elsewhere and delivered to communities belong to whoever developed them, regardless of who must implement them.\nAsset-based community development emerged as explicit alternative to deficit-based approaches. Rather than beginning with what communities lack, asset-based approaches begin with what communities have: skills, relationships, institutions, knowledge, resources that can be mobilized for community purposes. Asset-based public health identifies community strengths that promote health, builds on those strengths, and engages communities as partners in health improvement rather than targets of intervention. Several principles distinguish asset-based from deficit approaches: community members drive the process rather than external experts determining priorities. Assessment begins with what exists and works, not with what is absent and broken. Relationships matter more than services, creating connections that build capacity services cannot provide. Change comes from within, producing sustainable transformation that external intervention cannot create.\nThe evidence on asset-based approaches in health remains limited, partly because asset-based approaches resist the standardization that conventional evaluation requires. Studies suggest that community engagement in health program design improves outcomes, that programs involving community members as partners outperform programs treating communities as recipients, and that asset-based framing affects community self-perception in ways that influence health behaviors. But asset-based approaches face practical constraints. Funders typically require deficit documentation to justify investment, with grant applications demonstrating need through problems. Asset-based framing struggles to meet funder expectations designed for deficit-based logic. Asset-based approaches also take time that transformation timelines may not allow. Building relationships, identifying assets, developing community-driven priorities requires extended engagement. Programs facing implementation deadlines may not have time for processes that asset-based approaches require.\nAlternative perspectives challenge the primacy of dignity and agency concerns. The deficit reality view holds that problems are real and must be named. Rural health disparities exist, mortality rates are elevated, provider shortages persist. Pretending these problems do not exist or minimizing them to avoid deficit framing abandons communities that need intervention. The expertise necessity view holds that expert knowledge is necessary for effective programs. Communities may not know what interventions have evidence supporting them or understand healthcare financing, workforce policy, or regulatory requirements. The outcomes priority view holds that results matter more than process. If an externally designed program improves health outcomes, the fact that communities did not design it matters less than the improvement achieved. The capacity limitation view holds that communities often lack the organizational infrastructure, leadership depth, or civic engagement necessary to drive transformation processes. Waiting for community capacity may mean waiting indefinitely while health worsens.\nEach perspective contains truth that the dignity frame must accommodate. Deficits are real, though the critique of deficit framing is not that problems do not exist but that defining communities by their problems shapes intervention in ways that may undermine effectiveness. Expertise matters, though the critique is\n",

<p>Helen Caudill sat through the Louisville consultant&rsquo;s PowerPoint presentation about Letcher County, watching her community reduced to statistics on barriers and deficits. After seventy-three years living there and forty years helping neighbors navigate systems designed without them in mind, she recognized the pattern immediately. &ldquo;They come to fix us,&rdquo; she told her daughter afterward. &ldquo;They do not come to help us.&rdquo; Her distinction, between being fixed and being helped, captures what happens when $50 billion in rural health transformation meets communities already navigating $911 billion in simultaneous Medicaid cuts. The difference is not semantic. Help honors the person being helped, asks what they need, respects their judgment, expands their options, preserves their agency. Fixing treats people as problems, diagnoses deficits, prescribes solutions, measures compliance, judges success by whether the fixed person now resembles what fixers intended. The RHTP operates predominantly in fixing mode, and the cost of that choice extends beyond wounded feelings into questions of whether transformation can succeed at all.</p>
<p><strong>Deficit framing pervades how external institutions perceive and describe rural communities.</strong> Grant applications document needs and problems to justify funding. Research studies measure disparities to demonstrate the case for intervention. Policy briefs compile what rural America lacks: fewer physicians, higher mortality, lower income, less education, more chronic disease. The framing is not false. The disparities exist, the needs are real. But when communities are defined by their problems, interventions target those problems and <strong>the community becomes the object of intervention</strong> rather than a participant in determining what intervention should look like. Decades of being described as deficient, backward, left behind produces internalized narratives that constrain imagination. Young people absorb that their communities have no future and leave. Remaining residents absorb that they are problems awaiting solution and either accept solutions that do not serve them or reject engagement entirely. The framing shapes both what solutions look like and how communities see themselves.</p>
<p>Expert imposition flows naturally from deficit framing. Problems identified through external analysis require solutions developed through external expertise, a logic that appears throughout transformation. State agencies design programs based on evidence from research conducted elsewhere. Technical assistance providers from national organizations advise on implementation strategies developed for different contexts. Consultants with credentials but no local knowledge prescribe practices that worked in settings unlike the ones where they now recommend them. <strong>&ldquo;Evidence-based&rdquo; has become a term that often means &ldquo;developed and tested elsewhere.&rdquo;</strong> The evidence base for rural health interventions remains thin, with most research conducted in urban or suburban settings. Applying findings from those settings to rural contexts assumes transferability that may not exist. What worked in Cleveland may not work in Harlan, not because Harlan resists evidence but because the contexts differ in ways the evidence did not examine.</p>
<p>Outcome attribution compounds the dignity problem through a consistent pattern: when transformation efforts succeed, success is credited to the program, the intervention, the external expertise that guided implementation. When transformation efforts fail, failure is attributed to the community—they were resistant, noncompliant, not ready to change, lacking capacity, unwilling to engage. This attribution pattern appears explicitly in program evaluations and implicitly in how transformation is discussed. <strong>Communities become responsible for implementing programs designed without their input, then bear blame when programs do not achieve outcomes determined by external metrics.</strong> Agency in design flows to experts, accountability for outcomes flows to communities. The asymmetry is not accidental but structural, embedded in how transformation operates.</p>
<p>Paternalism operates through assumptions about what communities need that may not align with what communities want. The assumption that healthcare transformation should prioritize clinical quality metrics presumes that communities share that priority. The assumption that workforce development should emphasize credentialing presumes that communities value credentials over relationships. The assumption that technology deployment improves care presumes that communities experience technology as improvement. Paternalism does not require malice or condescension. Well-intentioned actors genuinely believe they know what communities need and act accordingly. <strong>The problem is not bad faith but the presumption</strong> that external knowledge supersedes local knowledge about local conditions and local values.</p>
<p>The first meeting between the rural health transformation planning committee and community members in Carroll County, Kentucky went poorly. The planning committee, composed of state agency staff, hospital administrators, and technical assistance consultants, presented a draft plan developed over months without community input. The plan was evidence-based, aligned with RHTP priorities, responsive to regional health data showing elevated rates of chronic disease and behavioral health needs. Rita Begley, who had organized community health events in Carroll County for fifteen years, asked why the community was learning about the plan at a presentation rather than helping develop it. The planning committee chair explained that community engagement was happening now, at this meeting, where feedback was welcome. &ldquo;Feedback on your plan is not the same as involvement in making a plan,&rdquo; Begley said. &ldquo;You have already decided what we need. Now you want us to say we agree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tension reflected competing views of community engagement. The planning committee believed they had engaged appropriately: they analyzed data, reviewed evidence, developed a plan designed to address identified needs, and brought that plan to the community for response. Community members believed engagement required something different: being present when needs were identified, when options were considered, when trade-offs were weighed. The planning committee had expertise about RHTP requirements, evidence on effective interventions, and technical capacity to develop fundable applications. Community members had different expertise: knowledge of their own circumstances, understanding of local dynamics, awareness of what previous interventions had attempted and why they failed or succeeded. <strong>Neither expertise was sufficient alone.</strong> The planning committee&rsquo;s plan reflected evidence from elsewhere applied to a community they did not know. Community members&rsquo; objections reflected experience that shaped receptivity to external intervention.</p>
<p>Six months later, a reconstituted planning process produced different results. Community members participated from the beginning, identifying what they saw as priority concerns (transportation, behavioral health, prescription costs) that differed somewhat from what data analysis had highlighted. Technical experts contributed knowledge about what interventions had evidence, what funding would support, what implementation required. The resulting plan reflected both perspectives, imperfectly merged but genuinely collaborative. Rita Begley chaired the community advisory committee for the revised plan, acknowledging that the plan was not what she would have designed alone, just as it was not what the state agency would have designed alone. &ldquo;But it is ours,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We made it together. When it works, we did that. When it struggles, we have to fix it together.&rdquo; The difference she described was ownership, which is another word for agency. Plans developed through partnership belong to those who developed them. Plans developed elsewhere and delivered to communities belong to whoever developed them, regardless of who must implement them.</p>
<p>Asset-based community development emerged as explicit alternative to deficit-based approaches. Rather than beginning with what communities lack, asset-based approaches begin with what communities have: skills, relationships, institutions, knowledge, resources that can be mobilized for community purposes. <strong>Asset-based public health</strong> identifies community strengths that promote health, builds on those strengths, and engages communities as partners in health improvement rather than targets of intervention. Several principles distinguish asset-based from deficit approaches: community members drive the process rather than external experts determining priorities. Assessment begins with what exists and works, not with what is absent and broken. Relationships matter more than services, creating connections that build capacity services cannot provide. Change comes from within, producing sustainable transformation that external intervention cannot create.</p>
<p>The evidence on asset-based approaches in health remains limited, partly because asset-based approaches resist the standardization that conventional evaluation requires. Studies suggest that community engagement in health program design improves outcomes, that programs involving community members as partners outperform programs treating communities as recipients, and that asset-based framing affects community self-perception in ways that influence health behaviors. But asset-based approaches face practical constraints. Funders typically require deficit documentation to justify investment, with grant applications demonstrating need through problems. Asset-based framing struggles to meet funder expectations designed for deficit-based logic. Asset-based approaches also take time that transformation timelines may not allow. Building relationships, identifying assets, developing community-driven priorities requires extended engagement. Programs facing implementation deadlines may not have time for processes that asset-based approaches require.</p>
<p>Alternative perspectives challenge the primacy of dignity and agency concerns. <strong>The deficit reality view</strong> holds that problems are real and must be named. Rural health disparities exist, mortality rates are elevated, provider shortages persist. Pretending these problems do not exist or minimizing them to avoid deficit framing abandons communities that need intervention. The expertise necessity view holds that expert knowledge is necessary for effective programs. Communities may not know what interventions have evidence supporting them or understand healthcare financing, workforce policy, or regulatory requirements. The outcomes priority view holds that results matter more than process. If an externally designed program improves health outcomes, the fact that communities did not design it matters less than the improvement achieved. The capacity limitation view holds that communities often lack the organizational infrastructure, leadership depth, or civic engagement necessary to drive transformation processes. Waiting for community capacity may mean waiting indefinitely while health worsens.</p>
<p>Each perspective contains truth that the dignity frame must accommodate. Deficits are real, though the critique of deficit framing is not that problems do not exist but that defining communities by their problems shapes intervention in ways that may undermine effectiveness. Expertise matters, though the critique is</p>
