79-82 +1 to +3 years Stable to improving Part VII: Regional Summary Profiles Appalachia Defining challenge: Post-extraction economic collapse without replacement industry\nHealthcare crisis: Hospital closures, workforce exodus, opioid epidemic epicenter\nDemographic pressure: Out-migration of working-age adults, aging in place without services\nPolitical context: Deep distrust of federal government, strong cultural identity, suspicion of outside intervention\nRHTP relevance: High funding need, moderate-high allocation, implementation challenged by workforce absence\nDelta (Mississippi/Arkansas/Louisiana) Defining challenge: Persistent poverty rooted in plantation economy legacy\nHealthcare crisis: Worst health outcomes nationally, Medicaid non-expansion, severe provider shortage\nDemographic pressure: Continued out-migration, aging population, majority-minority demographics\nPolitical context: State governments historically resistant to federal health programs\nRHTP relevance: Critical need, allocations constrained by state capacity and political will\nBlack Belt South Defining challenge: Historical disinvestment in majority-Black communities\nHealthcare crisis: Hospital closures concentrated, maternal mortality crisis, specialty access absent\nDemographic pressure: Young adult out-migration, elderly population growth, caregiving burden\nPolitical context: Variation by state, some expansion (LA) vs. non-expansion (GA, AL)\nRHTP relevance: High need, implementation dependent on state-level decisions\nGreat Plains Defining challenge: Agricultural consolidation and depopulation creating service deserts\nHealthcare crisis: Distance rather than absence, CAH network stretched thin, EMS response times\nDemographic pressure: Rapid aging, schools closing, communities below sustainability threshold\nPolitical context: Strong self-reliance ethos, skepticism of government programs\nRHTP relevance: Distance bonus in formula helps, but population loss undermines infrastructure viability\nRural West Defining challenge: Bifurcation between amenity-rich areas and struggling communities\nHealthcare crisis: Tribal health disparities, frontier isolation, seasonal population swings\nDemographic pressure: Amenity migration creating housing cost pressure, tribal communities often youngest\nPolitical context: Libertarian threads, federal land tension, tribal sovereignty considerations\nRHTP relevance: IHS coordination critical, state variation significant\nUpper Midwest Defining challenge: Manufacturing decline without complete collapse\nHealthcare crisis: Moderate but growing, workforce aging faster than replacement\nDemographic pressure: Stable but slowly declining, immigration partially offsetting native out-migration\nPolitical context: Strong civic infrastructure, cooperative traditions, pragmatic politics\nRHTP relevance: Relatively strong implementation capacity, moderate need\nNew England Rural Defining challenge: High costs and aging population in otherwise functional systems\nHealthcare crisis: Least severe nationally, but workforce aging and facility updates needed\nDemographic pressure: Oldest population, in-migration of retirees, limited young family formation\nPolitical context: Universal Medicaid expansion, strong state health departments\nRHTP relevance: Lower formula allocation due to better baseline, implementation capacity strong\nPart VIII: Cross-Regional Analysis Regions Requiring Intensive RHTP Investment Rank Region Rationale 1 Delta Worst outcomes, weakest infrastructure, lowest capacity 2 Black Belt South Comparable crisis to Delta, slightly better state capacity in some areas 3 Appalachia Severe crisis with workforce absence, opioid overlay 4 Great Plains Distance challenges unique, depopulation threatens all infrastructure 5 Rural West Bifurcated needs, tribal health requires distinct approach 6 Upper Midwest Moderate need, strong implementation potential 7 New England Rural Lowest need, highest capacity Regional Variation in Transformation Approach Approach Best Fit Regions Poor Fit Regions Telehealth expansion Great Plains, Rural West Delta, Appalachia (broadband limits) Hub-and-spoke networks Upper Midwest, New England Great Plains (distance), Delta (hub absence) Community health workers Delta, Black Belt, Appalachia Great Plains (population density) Workforce loan repayment All regions Effectiveness varies by baseline Hospital conversion (REH) Appalachia, Black Belt Great Plains (distance makes ER-only risky) Mobile health units Great Plains, Rural West New England (less needed) Part IX: Data Sources and Methodology Primary Data Sources Demographics: Census Bureau ACS 5-year estimates, Population Estimates Program Economics: BEA Regional Economic Accounts, BLS QCEW, USDA ERS Healthcare: AHRF, AHA Annual Survey, CMS Provider Data, UNC Sheps Center Health Outcomes: CDC WONDER, NVSS, BRFSS Social Infrastructure: USDA Food Access Atlas, FCC Broadband Maps, various surveys Regional Boundary Sources Appalachia: Appalachian Regional Commission official designation Delta: Delta Regional Authority designation plus adjacent high-poverty counties Black Belt: Historical definition plus persistent poverty overlay Great Plains: USDA ERS farm-dependent counties plus adjacent Rural West: Mountain and intermountain nonmetro counties Upper Midwest: State-based definition of rural counties in WI, MN, MI, northern tier New England: State-based definition of nonmetro counties Limitations Regional boundaries are analytical constructs with inherent arbitrariness Within-region variation often exceeds between-region variation Data vintage varies by source (2020-2024) Some metrics unavailable at

</div>

<p>National rural statistics obscure <strong>dramatic regional variation</strong>. A county in rural Vermont shares little with a county in the Mississippi Delta beyond federal classification. Policy designed for &ldquo;rural America&rdquo; as monolith fails communities whose challenges differ fundamentally.</p>
<p>This reference document provides <strong>systematic comparison across seven primary rural regions</strong> on five dimensions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Demographics</li>
<li>Economics</li>
<li>Healthcare infrastructure</li>
<li>Social infrastructure</li>
<li>Health outcomes</li>
</ol>
<p>The matrix establishes <strong>baseline regional profiles</strong> supporting Series 10 (Regional Deep Dives) and enabling region-appropriate policy analysis throughout the project.</p>
