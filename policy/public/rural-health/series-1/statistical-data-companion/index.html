U.S. Census Bureau (ACS) Demographics, income, education, housing Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Broadband access, connectivity Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Healthcare utilization, provider data UNC Sheps Center for Health Services Research Hospital closures, rural health infrastructure Feeding America (Map the Meal Gap) Food insecurity, meal costs KFF (Kaiser Family Foundation) Insurance coverage, Medicaid data Chartis Rural Health Analysis Hospital financial viability National Center for Education Statistics Education attainment, enrollment Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) Regional economic accounts Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Employment, wages Data Currency Notes Data represents most recent available estimates as of late 2024 and early 2025. Some figures reflect ranges due to varying definitions across sources. Users should verify specific statistics against primary sources for time-sensitive applications.\nMethodological Limitations Definitions of “rural” vary across federal agencies, creating comparability challenges. Census Bureau, OMB, and USDA each use different classification systems. This companion primarily uses USDA ERS nonmetro/metro distinction unless otherwise noted.\nSee 1-TD-B: Rural Classification Reference Guide for detailed analysis of classification systems and their concordance.\nRelated Technical Documents Document Title Function 1-TD-A Statistical Data Companion This document 1-TD-B Rural Classification Reference Guide Classification systems, concordance tables, program eligibility crosswalks 1-TD-C Regional Variation Matrix Seven-region demographic, economic, and health infrastructure comparison Technical Document 1-TD-A Series 1: Understanding Rural and Deep Rural America Rural Health Transformation Project Version 1.0 | January 2026\n",

<h2 id="purpose">Purpose<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#purpose">#</a></h2>
<p>This technical document provides <strong>empirical grounding</strong> for all ten articles in Series 1. Rather than embedding dense statistical tables within narrative articles, this companion consolidates key metrics, sources, and comparative data in a single reference document.</p>
<p><strong>Three functions:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Evidence repository</strong> for claims made throughout Series 1</li>
<li><strong>Quick reference</strong> for researchers needing specific rural statistics</li>
<li><strong>Baseline documentation</strong> supporting subsequent series analysis</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Usage note:</strong> Data reflects most recent available estimates as of late 2024 and early 2025. Figures represent ranges in some cases due to varying definitions and methodologies across sources.</p>

<p>Data represents most recent available estimates as of late 2024 and early 2025. Some figures reflect ranges due to varying definitions across sources. Users should verify specific statistics against primary sources for time-sensitive applications.</p>
<h2 id="methodological-limitations">Methodological Limitations<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#methodological-limitations">#</a></h2>
<p>Definitions of &ldquo;rural&rdquo; vary across federal agencies, creating comparability challenges. Census Bureau, OMB, and USDA each use different classification systems. This companion primarily uses USDA ERS nonmetro/metro distinction unless otherwise noted.</p>
<p>See <strong>1-TD-B: Rural Classification Reference Guide</strong> for detailed analysis of classification systems and their concordance.</p>
