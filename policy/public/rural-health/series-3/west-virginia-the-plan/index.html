  "articleBody": "Part 1 established the baseline: $199.5 million for approximately 1.1 million rural West Virginians translates to $181 per person annually, among the highest per capita allocations in the nation. Fifteen rural hospitals face closure risk. Six face immediate closure within three years. West Virginia leads the nation in deaths from cancer, drug overdose, diabetes, and kidney disease. Life expectancy dropped nearly two years in 2021. The workforce participation rate ranks near the bottom nationally, and poor health is the primary reason West Virginians cite for not working.\nWest Virginia responded with seven flagship initiatives under Governor Patrick Morrisey’s Health to Prosperity vision, a framework that positions health improvement as the prerequisite for economic revival. The application, developed with assistance from McKinsey and Company at a cost of $2 million, received endorsement from more than 40 healthcare organizations and incorporated feedback from more than 17,000 residents who participated in a statewide tele-townhall.\nThe strategic approach reflects West Virginia’s unique position as the only state located entirely within Appalachia, where nearly the entire population qualifies as rural and where health challenges compound across generations. Unlike larger states that must allocate resources across diverse regional needs, West Virginia can concentrate investment on a smaller population facing concentrated crisis. Whether this concentration of need and investment produces transformation or merely delays decline depends on implementation choices that begin now.\nThe central premise: health improvement drives workforce participation, workforce participation drives economic revival, and economic revival creates the sustainable tax base necessary to maintain health systems beyond RHTP’s five-year window. This circular logic requires each component to function for any component to succeed.\nThe Strategic Framework Governance Structure The West Virginia Department of Health (WVDOH) serves as lead agency for all RHTP implementation. Governor Morrisey designated the Department of Health rather than the Department of Health and Human Resources, reflecting organizational restructuring that separated public health functions from human services administration. Dr. Arvin Singh, Secretary of Health, bears primary responsibility for program direction and outcomes.\nWithin days of the December 29, 2025 award announcement, Dr. Singh announced the Department was actively recruiting leadership for the Rural Health Transformation Program. The recruitment call emphasized seeking physicians, nurses, administrators, and leaders with experience in health systems transformation.\nRole Function Secretary of Health (Dr. Arvin Singh) Program authority, strategic direction, CMS liaison RHTP Director (to be appointed) Day-to-day management, initiative coordination Initiative Leads Subject-matter experts for each of seven initiatives Regional Coordinators Stakeholder engagement across geographic zones Grants Management Subaward administration, compliance monitoring Data and Evaluation Performance tracking, annual reporting The governance structure centralizes authority within the Department of Health while allowing for distributed implementation through subawards. The state indicated funding will flow through a mix of competitive grants and direct state agency awards, suggesting some initiatives will use procurement processes while others will direct funds to established partners.\nTheory of Change The West Virginia application operates on an integrated transformation theory that connects healthcare improvement to economic recovery. The logic model:\nHealth barriers drive workforce nonparticipation. Poor health, chronic disease, substance use disorder, and disability are the primary reasons West Virginians cite for not working. Addressing these barriers requires accessible healthcare.\nHealthcare requires access infrastructure. Rural West Virginians cannot reach care due to geographic isolation, transportation barriers, and provider shortages. The Connected Care Grid and Rural Health Link address access barriers directly.\nAccess requires workforce. No technology can replace the need for healthcare providers. The Mountain State Care Force builds the pipeline of physicians, nurses, and allied health professionals the state needs.\nSustainability requires payment reform. Fee-for-service payment perpetuates volume over value. Smart Care Catalyst equips providers with tools and incentives to shift toward value-based models that reward outcomes.\nPrevention reduces treatment burden. The chronic diseases devastating West Virginia are largely preventable through lifestyle modification. The Personal Health Accelerator invests in upstream prevention aligned with Governor Morrisey’s four-pillar health initiative and federal Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) priorities.\nRecovery enables productivity. The Health to Prosperity Pipeline explicitly connects substance use disorder recovery, care management, and employment support, treating recovery as the pathway to workforce participation.\nInnovation creates opportunity. HealthTech Appalachia positions West Virginia as a hub for rural health innovation, creating economic activity and potentially attracting investment and talent.\nThe theory’s vulnerabilities include the timeline mismatch between five-year RHTP funding and the decade-long investments required for workforce development, the Medicaid offset problem where projected $6.6 billion in cuts over ten years may overwhelm $1 billion in transformation investment, and the assumption that improved health translates to employment in a state where job opportunities themselves remain limited.\nCore Initiatives and Interrelationships The seven initiatives form a conceptual ecosystem, though implementation reality will test whether theoretical integration holds:\nAccess Layer\nConnected Care Grid provides virtual and mobile care delivery Rural Health Link solves transportation barriers to physical care sites Workforce Layer\nMountain State Care Force builds provider pipeline Health to Prosperity Pipeline connects recovery to employment Technology Layer\nSmart Care Catalyst modernizes provider operations HealthTech Appalachia incubates innovation Prevention Layer\nPersonal Health Accelerator addresses chronic disease upstream Each initiative depends on others for full effect. Telehealth without workforce produces virtual waiting rooms. Transportation without destination providers moves patients to facilities that cannot serve them. Workforce without sustainable payment models produces providers who leave for better-compensated positions elsewhere. The plan requires coordinated execution across all seven initiatives, a significant implementation challenge for a state agency building program capacity from scratch.\nProgram Allocation Table Program Name Focus Area Estimated FY2026 Allocation Lead Organization Key Deliverables Connected Care Grid Access/Technology $45-55 million WVDOH, hospitals, FQHCs Telehealth expansion; remote patient monitoring; mobile care units; EMS treatment-in-place protocols Rural Health Link Transportation $20-28 million WVDOH, transit partners Unified scheduling platform; vehicle and driver grants; NEMT coordination Mountain State Care Force Workforce $35-45 million WVDOH, academic partners Rural residency expansion; loan forgiveness; return-to-home scholarships; apprenticeship programs Smart Care Catalyst Technology/Payment $25-32 million WVDOH, rural providers Health IT grants; value-based care transition support; data infrastructure Health to Prosperity Pipeline Workforce/Recovery $18-25 million WVDOH, workforce boards, employers Recovery-to-work programs; care coordination; employment partnerships Personal Health Accelerator Prevention $22-30 million WVDOH, local health departments, CBOs Food-as-medicine programs; physical activity initiatives; chronic disease prevention HealthTech Appalachia Innovation $10-15 million WVDOH, universities, venture partners Innovation accelerator; AI/digital health pilots; partnership development Program Administration Operations $12-16 million WVDOH Staffing; evaluation; reporting; technical assistance Note: Allocations are estimates based on initiative descriptions and comparable state programs. Official allocation breakdown pending WVDOH release of detailed implementation plan.\nTotal: $199,476,099 (FY2026)\nInitiative 1: Connected Care Grid Design and Mechanics The flagship access initiative builds infrastructure to bring care to people rather than requiring people to travel to care. West Virginia’s mountainous terrain, winding roads, and dispersed population make traditional facility-based care delivery inherently inefficient. The Connected Care Grid addresses this through four integrated components:\nTelehealth Expansion: Video consultation capacity extended to rural hospitals, clinics, FQHCs, and community access points. The initiative builds on existing telehealth infrastructure developed during COVID-19 while addressing persistent broadband gaps that limit connectivity in the most remote communities. Integration with WVU Medicine and Marshall Health telehealth networks extends specialist access to rural sites.\nRemote Patient Monitoring: Home-based devices transmitting vital signs, blood glucose, weight, oxygen saturation, and other metrics to care teams. Targets patients with chronic conditions including diabetes, heart failure, COPD, and hypertension, enabling intervention before acute episodes require emergency care or hospitalization. The CHW-based chronic care management model developed in Mingo County provides a template for integrating remote monitoring with community health worker support.\nMobile Care Units: Vehicles equipped for clinical service delivery traveling to underserved communities on scheduled routes. Mobile units bring primary care, dental services, behavioral health, and screening programs to communities lacking fixed facilities. Coordination with EMS and transportation networks ensures mobile units complement rather than duplicate other services.\nEMS Treatment-in-Place: Expands the role of paramedics and EMTs to provide community paramedicine and mobile integrated healthcare (MIH) services. Rather than transporting all 911 callers to emergency departments, trained EMS personnel can assess patients at home, provide treatment, and connect them to appropriate care resources. The West Virginia Office of Emergency Medical Services has supported MIH/CP training through Mountwest Community and Technical College, providing the foundation for expanded deployment.\nTarget Population and Geography The initiative prioritizes communities with the greatest access barriers while acknowledging infrastructure prerequisites:\nPriority Population Access Challenge Highest Southern coalfields (McDowell, Mingo, Logan, Wyoming) Extreme isolation, population decline, hospital closures High Central Appalachian counties Distance to specialists, limited broadband High Eastern Panhandle communities Growing population outpacing infrastructure Moderate Northern Panhandle Better access but aging facilities Moderate Areas with existing broadband Technology deployment feasible Broadband constraints remain significant. Deployment of telehealth and remote monitoring requires connectivity that does not exist in portions of rural West Virginia. The initiative must coordinate with BEAD Program broadband buildout timelines, potentially sequencing deployments to match infrastructure availability.\nFunding Allocation Estimated: $45-55 million (FY2026)\nComponent Allocation Notes Telehealth infrastructure $15-18M Equipment, platform licensing, installation Remote monitoring programs $12-15M Devices, monitoring infrastructure, care coordination Mobile care units $8-10M Vehicles, equipment, staffing support EMS treatment-in-place $6-8M Training, protocols, equipment, medical direction Technical assistance $4-5M Implementation support, evaluation Subawardees Anticipated subawardees include:\nWVU Medicine: Largest health system, telehealth hub, specialist network Marshall Health Network: Huntington-area system, telehealth capacity Critical Access Hospitals: 21 CAHs statewide as deployment sites Federally Qualified Health Centers: WVPCA member sites (515+ locations) Rural Health Clinics: Primary care access points EMS agencies: Treatment-in-place implementation Broadband and technology vendors: Infrastructure deployment Implementation Timeline Phase Timeline Activities Planning Q1 2026 Site assessments, vendor selection, protocol development Pilot Q2-Q3 2026 Initial deployments in highest-priority areas Expansion Q4 2026-Q2 2027 Scaled deployment across additional sites Optimization Ongoing Performance monitoring, continuous improvement Initiative 2: Rural Health Link Design and Mechanics Transportation is cited as a barrier to care in virtually every assessment of West Virginia’s rural health challenges. Patients miss appointments because rides do not arrive. Dialysis patients requiring three-times-weekly treatment travel hours on mountain roads. Pregnant women in southern counties may travel 60 or more miles for prenatal care. Rural Health Link creates unified health mobility infrastructure addressing these barriers.\nOne-Stop Scheduling Platform: A single point of access connecting patients to all available transportation resources. Currently, patients must navigate separately among non-emergency medical transportation (NEMT) through Medicaid, public transit where available, community ride programs, volunteer driver networks, and informal family support. The platform integrates these resources into a unified system allowing patients to schedule rides through one interface.\nVehicle and Driver Grants: Competitive awards to expand local and regional transportation capacity. Grant recipients may include county transit authorities, community action agencies, faith-based organizations, and other entities with transportation infrastructure that can be expanded for health-related trips.\nData-Driven Coordination: Integration with EMS dispatch, hospital discharge planning, and clinic scheduling to optimize routing and reduce costs. The platform captures transportation demand data enabling better resource allocation and identification of underserved areas.\nTarget Population Primary beneficiaries include:\nMedicaid enrollees using NEMT benefits Medicare beneficiaries without NEMT coverage Uninsured and underinsured residents without personal transportation Patients with mobility limitations requiring specialized vehicles Rural residents in communities without public transit Funding Allocation Estimated: $20-28 million (FY2026)\nComponent Allocation Notes Platform development and licensing $5-7M Technology, integration, user interfaces Vehicle grants $8-12M New vehicles for transportation providers Driver recruitment and training $3-4M Workforce expansion Operations support $4-5M Coordination staff, call center Subawardees Anticipated subawardees include:\nMedicaid NEMT contractor: Integration with existing Medicaid transportation Regional transit authorities: Expansion of public transit capacity Community action agencies: Community-based transportation programs Volunteer driver programs: Coordination and expansion support Technology vendors: Platform development and maintenance Coordination Requirements Rural Health Link must integrate with:\nMedicaid NEMT: Primary source of health transportation funding EMS dispatch: Emergency versus non-emergency triage Hospital discharge planning: Ride home coordination Clinic scheduling: Appointment-linked transportation Connected Care Grid: Mobile care unit routing Initiative 3: Mountain State Care Force Design and Mechanics West Virginia faces severe workforce shortages across primary care, mental health, dental health, nursing, and allied health professions. Most rural counties carry Health Professional Shortage Area designations. The Mountain State Care Force addresses shortages through recruitment, training, and retention strategies:\nRural Residency Expansion: Increased training positions in family medicine, internal medicine, psychiatry, and other specialties at rural sites. Physicians who train in rural areas are more likely to practice in rural areas. The initiative expands graduate medical education capacity beyond Charleston and Morgantown.\nLoan Forgiveness Programs: Building on existing programs including West Virginia Higher Education Policy Commission’s $40,000 loan forgiveness for medical students committing to rural practice. RHTP funding expands eligibility and increases award amounts.\nReturn-to-Home Scholarships: In-state tuition for out-of-state students who commit to equal years of rural practice in West Virginia, implementing HB 4768 passed in 2024. The initiative provides additional support beyond tuition including living expenses and training costs.\nLearn and Earn Apprenticeships: Entry-level healthcare jobs through community college partnerships creating pathways for West Virginians to enter healthcare careers without relocating for extended education.\nCommunity Health Worker Expansion: Training and employment support for CHWs who provide culturally appropriate outreach, navigation, and care coordination. West Virginia has existing CHW infrastructure through the WVSOM Center for Rural and Community Health CHERP program and Marshall University’s CHW training.\nTarget Professions Profession Current Shortage Strategy Primary Care Physicians Severe (most rural counties HPSA) Residency expansion, loan forgiveness Psychiatrists/Mental Health Severe (statewide) Residency expansion, telehealth Nurse Practitioners Moderate Full practice authority leveraged Registered Nurses Moderate Apprenticeship programs Community Health Workers Developing workforce Training expansion, employment support Dental Professionals Severe Loan forgiveness, mobile dental Funding Allocation Estimated: $35-45 million (FY2026)\nComponent Allocation Notes Residency expansion $12-15M New training slots, site development Loan forgiveness $10-12M Expanded eligibility and amounts Return-to-home scholarships $5-7M Out-of-state recruitment Apprenticeship programs $4-6M Community college partnerships CHW training and employment $4-5M Expansion of existing programs Subawardees Anticipated subawardees include:\nWest Virginia University: Medical school, residency programs, workforce research Marshall University: Medical school, CHW training, residency expansion West Virginia School of Osteopathic Medicine (WVSOM): Primary care pipeline, CHERP CHW training Community and Technical Colleges: Apprenticeship programs, allied health training Area Health Education Centers (AHECs): Pipeline programs, continuing education Critical Access Hospitals: Rural training sites FQHCs: CHW employment, training sites Initiative 4: Smart Care Catalyst Design and Mechanics Rural providers operate with outdated technology, fragmented data systems, and payment models that reward volume over value. Smart Care Catalyst modernizes the operational and financial infrastructure enabling sustainable care delivery:\nTechnology Grants: Equipment and software awards to rural hospitals, clinics, and practices. Priorities include EHR upgrades, interoperability tools, telehealth integration, and cybersecurity improvements.\nValue-Based Care Transition: Technical assistance and financial support helping providers shift from fee-for-service to value-based payment arrangements. Training on quality measurement, population health management, and care coordination.\nData Infrastructure: Investment in health information exchange capacity enabling care coordination across settings. Integration with West Virginia Health Information Network (WVHIN).\nFunding Allocation Estimated: $25-32 million (FY2026)\nComponent Allocation Notes Technology grants $15-18M Equipment, software, implementation Value-based care TA $5-7M Training, consulting, transition support Data infrastructure $5-7M HIE capacity, interoperability Subawardees Anticipated subawardees include:\nRural hospitals: Technology upgrade recipients FQHCs: EHR and technology improvements Rural Health Clinics: Practice transformation support Health IT vendors: Implementation services Value-based care consultants: Transition support Initiative 5: Health to Prosperity Pipeline Design and Mechanics The initiative explicitly connects health improvement to workforce participation, addressing the reality that poor health is the primary barrier to employment in West Virginia. Components include:\nRecovery-to-Work Programs: Comprehensive support for individuals with substance use disorder history transitioning to employment. Integration of treatment, recovery support, job coaching, and employer partnerships.\nHealth-to-Work Programs: Care management and support services helping individuals with chronic conditions return to or maintain employment. Coordination with disability services, vocational rehabilitation, and workforce development boards.\nEmployer Partnerships: Incentives and support for employers hiring individuals recovering from health challenges. On-site wellness programs. Flexible scheduling accommodating treatment needs.\nMCO and Employer Incentives: Potential incentives for managed care organizations or employers who successfully transition individuals from Medicaid to commercial coverage or employment-based insurance.\nFunding Allocation Estimated: $18-25 million (FY2026)\nComponent Allocation Notes Recovery-to-work programs $8-10M Treatment integration, employment support Health-to-work programs $5-7M Chronic disease management, vocational support Employer partnerships $3-5M Incentives, on-site wellness Coordination infrastructure $2-3M Case management, data systems Subawardees Anticipated subawardees include:\nWorkforce development boards: Employment coordination Substance use disorder treatment providers: Recovery program integration Vocational rehabilitation: Disability employment services Employers: Partnership programs Community-based organizations: Wraparound support Initiative 6: Personal Health Accelerator Design and Mechanics The prevention initiative aligns with Governor Morrisey’s four-pillar health initiative and federal Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) priorities. Components address lifestyle factors driving chronic disease:\nFood-as-Medicine Programs: Medically tailored meals, produce prescriptions, and nutrition education. Building on existing initiatives including House Bill 2354 requiring healthier school meals and SNAP reforms linking education to improved nutrition.\nPhysical Activity Programs: Community fitness initiatives, walking programs, and movement-focused interventions. Support for local recreation infrastructure.\nChronic Disease Prevention: Community-based programs targeting diabetes, heart disease, and other preventable conditions. Screening, education, and early intervention.\nCaregiver Support: Resources for family caregivers enabling continued home-based care for elderly and disabled family members.\nFunding Allocation Estimated: $22-30 million (FY2026)\nComponent Allocation Notes Food-as-medicine $10-12M Produce prescriptions, medically tailored meals Physical activity $5-7M Community programs, infrastructure Chronic disease prevention $5-7M Screening, education, intervention Caregiver support $2-4M Respite, training, resources Subawardees Anticipated subawardees include:\nLocal health departments: Community program implementation FQHCs: Clinical integration of prevention Community-based organizations: Program delivery Food banks and pantries: Food-as-medicine partnerships Schools and recreation departments: Physical activity venues Initiative 7: HealthTech Appalachia Design and Mechanics The innovation initiative positions West Virginia as a hub for rural health innovation, creating economic opportunity while advancing health improvement:\nInnovation Accelerator: Funding for AI-enabled, digital health, and consumer health tools with particular focus on innovations addressing rural West Virginia challenges including chronic disease management, substance use disorder, and maternal health.\nUniversity Partnerships: Collaboration with WVU, Marshall, and other institutions on research, development, and commercialization of health innovations.\nVenture Partnerships: Connections with venture capital and angel investors interested in rural health opportunities.\nFunding Allocation Estimated: $10-15 million (FY2026)\nComponent Allocation Notes Innovation accelerator $6-8M Startup funding, pilot support University partnerships $3-4M Research collaboration Ecosystem development $1-3M Venture connections, events Subawardees Anticipated subawardees include:\nWest Virginia University: Research partnerships Marshall University: Innovation collaboration Startup companies: Accelerator participants Venture capital partners: Investment ecosystem Social Care Integration SDOH/HRSN Initiatives West Virginia’s RHTP application incorporates social determinants of health addressing across multiple initiatives rather than as a standalone program:\nScreening Requirements: The Connected Care Grid includes social needs screening as part of telehealth and mobile care encounters. Digital intake tools capture housing, food, transportation, and safety data.\nNavigation and Coordination: CHW expansion under Mountain State Care Force provides navigation capacity. Community health workers connect patients to social services and community resources. The CHW-based chronic care management model developed in Mingo County demonstrates this approach.\nResource Connection: Integration with WVU Medicine’s findhelp platform enables patient self-referral to community resources. Findhelp’s network of 605,700+ program locations provides directory infrastructure.\nSDOH Component Status in WV Application Screening requirements Included (via Connected Care Grid) Navigation infrastructure Included (via CHW expansion) Social needs data capture Included (via technology initiatives) Closed-loop referral Partial (findhelp integration) Resource directory Existing (findhelp) Community Health Worker Programs West Virginia has established CHW infrastructure that RHTP will expand:\nWVSOM CHERP Program: The West Virginia School of Osteopathic Medicine Center for Rural and Community Health offers Community Health Education Resource Person (CHERP) training, a three-level curriculum preparing community members to provide health education, outreach, and navigation. Training is available online and in-person across West Virginia.\nMarshall University Training: Marshall provides standardized CHW training and continuing education services supporting the chronic care management model that demonstrated significant outcomes in Appalachian communities.\nMedicaid CHW Reimbursement: West Virginia has pursued Medicaid reimbursement for CHW services through managed care arrangements. The Drug Free Mom and Baby Program uses CHWs to support individuals with opioid use disorder during pregnancy and postpartum.\nCHW Element FY2026 Plan Status Training pipeline expansion Yes Funded via Mountain State Care Force Employment support Yes Grants to CHW employers Medicaid reimbursement Existing Managed care arrangements Supervision infrastructure Partial Academic partner support Statewide deployment targets TBD Implementation planning underway Community Information Exchange and Referral Platforms Current State: West Virginia does not have a statewide CIE platform. WVU Medicine has deployed findhelp (formerly Aunt Bertha) integrated with its EPIC electronic health record system, enabling patients to search for community resources through the MyWVUChart patient portal.\nRHTP Approach: The application does not mandate statewide CIE platform procurement. The strategy relies on expanding findhelp integration and building CHW navigation capacity rather than deploying new technology infrastructure.\nCIE Element Status Statewide platform Not funded (reliance on findhelp) EHR integration Existing (WVU Medicine/findhelp) 211 integration Not explicitly addressed Resource directory maintenance Via findhelp Closed-loop tracking Partial Technology Vendor Landscape Current SDOH/CIE platforms operating in West Virginia:\nPlatform Presence Coverage Findhelp Active WVU Medicine integration, public access 211 Statewide Information and referral Health system proprietary Limited Facility-specific Procurement Status: No active statewide procurement for CIE platforms under RHTP. Findhelp expansion through existing WVU Medicine partnership represents primary strategy.\nSocial Care Integration Summary Table Component Requested Estimated Allocation Vendor/Operator Status SDOH Screening Yes Within Connected Care Grid WVDOH, providers Funded HRSN Navigation Yes Within CHW expansion CHW employers Funded CHW Deployment Yes $4-5M WVSOM, Marshall, employers Funded CIE Platform No N/A Findhelp (existing) Existing infrastructure Subawardee Registry Organization Type Estimated Contract Value Role in RHTP Implementation West Virginia Hospital Association Intermediary $8-12M Hospital coordination, technical assistance, policy advocacy West Virginia Primary Care Association Intermediary $6-10M FQHC network coordination, workforce pipeline, CHW deployment WVU Medicine Academic/Provider Hub $15-25M Telehealth hub, specialist access, findhelp integration, workforce training Marshall Health Network Academic/Provider Hub $8-15M Telehealth expansion, CHW training, workforce development West Virginia School of Osteopathic Medicine Academic Partner $3-5M CHERP CHW training, primary care workforce pipeline Critical Access Hospitals (21) Provider Sites Competitive awards Technology deployment, care delivery, training sites FQHCs (28 grantees, 515+ sites) Provider Sites Competitive awards Primary care delivery, CHW employment, prevention programs Rural Health Clinics Provider Sites Competitive awards Primary care access, technology upgrades Community and Technical Colleges Training Partners $3-5M Apprenticeship programs, MIH/CP training Local Health Departments Public Health $5-8M Prevention programs, community health Community-Based Organizations Community Partners Competitive awards Food-as-medicine, physical activity, social support Transportation Providers Service Partners $8-12M Vehicle grants, driver programs, ride coordination Technology Vendors Technology Competitive procurement Platform deployment, equipment, integration Note: Contract values are estimates based on initiative allocations and comparable programs. Actual awards pending WVDOH procurement processes.\nFunding Flow Documentation How Money Moves from CMS to End Recipients Level 1: Federal to State CMS transfers RHTP cooperative agreement funds to WVDOH on an agreed schedule, typically quarterly or based on expenditure reporting. The $199,476,099 FY2026 award represents the first year of a projected five-year commitment.\nLevel 2: State Agency Administration WVDOH retains approximately 6-8% ($12-16 million) for program administration including staffing, evaluation, reporting, and technical assistance. The Department establishes initiative-specific budgets and subaward structures.\nLevel 3: Intermediary Distribution Major intermediaries (Hospital Association, Primary Care Association, academic medical centers) receive block allocations for defined activities including network coordination, technical assistance, and pass-through to members.\nLevel 4: Competitive Subawards Individual providers, CBOs, and other eligible entities compete for awards within initiative categories. Competitive processes determine which organizations receive funding for specific projects.\nLevel 5: Performance-Based Adjustments Subaward agreements include performance milestones. Continued funding depends on demonstrated progress. Poorly performing subawardees may face reduced allocations in subsequent periods.\nDistribution Timeline Phase Timeline Activities CMS Award December 2025 $199.5M award announced Planning January-March 2026 Detailed budget development, procurement preparation Initial Awards April-June 2026 Major intermediary contracts, first competitive rounds Implementation July 2026 forward Program activities, ongoing procurement Reporting Quarterly Progress reports to CMS Annual Review September-December 2026 Performance assessment, Year 2 planning Cross-Initiative Coordination How Initiatives Connect and Reinforce The seven initiatives function as an integrated system when properly coordinated:\nConnected Care Grid + Mountain State Care Force: Telehealth requires providers. Workforce development creates the clinicians who staff virtual and in-person care. Rural residency expansion creates specialists available for teleconsultation.\nConnected Care Grid + Rural Health Link: Patients who cannot travel physically can access virtual care. Patients requiring in-person services receive transportation. The unified scheduling platform coordinates both modalities.\nMountain State Care Force + Health to Prosperity Pipeline: Workforce development includes entry-level pathways. Health-to-work programs create candidates for healthcare apprenticeships. Recovery graduates become community health workers.\nSmart Care Catalyst + Connected Care Grid: Technology grants enable telehealth infrastructure. Data systems support remote monitoring. Value-based care models create financial sustainability for transformed delivery.\nPersonal Health Accelerator + Health to Prosperity Pipeline: Prevention programs improve population health. Healthier individuals become employable. Employment provides income supporting healthy lifestyle choices.\nHealthTech Appalachia + All Initiatives: Innovation accelerator incubates tools supporting other initiatives. AI clinical decision support enhances Connected Care Grid. Digital engagement tools support Personal Health Accelerator.\nShared Infrastructure Infrastructure Supporting Initiatives Data systems All (performance tracking, coordination) Technology platform Connected Care Grid, Smart Care Catalyst Scheduling systems Rural Health Link, Connected Care Grid Training infrastructure Mountain State Care Force, Health to Prosperity Provider network All clinical initiatives Integration Challenges Timeline mismatch: Workforce development requires years; technology can deploy in months Geographic variation: Not all infrastructure available everywhere simultaneously Organizational boundaries: Multiple agencies and partners must coordinate Data integration: Systems must connect for seamless care coordination Sustainability alignment: Initiatives must create lasting change, not temporary activity Stakeholder Architecture Lead Agency Role West Virginia Department of Health: Statutory authority for RHTP implementation.

For West Virginia’s FY2026 award:\n$133 million must be obligated by September 30, 2027 Remaining funds must be obligated within the five-year program period This requirement pressures rapid procurement while maintaining quality control.\nPerformance Monitoring Metric Category Examples Access Telehealth encounters, transportation trips completed Workforce Training completions, placement rates, retention Technology Sites equipped, EHR adoption, interoperability Prevention Screening rates, chronic disease indicators Recovery Employment rates, coverage transitions Financial Obligation rates, subawardee performance What the Plan Assumes Explicit Assumptions in State Application Health improvement drives workforce participation Technology can extend provider capacity Prevention reduces long-term costs Workforce pipelines can be accelerated Value-based care models are financially sustainable Federal funding continues for five years Annual re-scoring rewards demonstrated progress Implicit Assumptions Not Stated Broadband infrastructure arrives on compatible timelines Medicaid cuts do not overwhelm transformation gains Hospitals at risk of closure survive long enough to participate Workforce pipeline graduates remain in West Virginia Employers exist to hire recovered and healthy workers State budget constraints do not limit match requirements Political support continues across administration changes Dependencies on External Factors Dependency Risk if Unmet BEAD broadband buildout Telehealth deployment delays Medicaid funding stability Hospital closures, coverage losses Labor market demand Employment outcomes limited Federal policy consistency Re-scoring criteria changes State fiscal capacity Sustainability after RHTP Risks Acknowledged Versus Ignored Acknowledged:\nWorkforce shortages require long-term investment Transportation barriers are complex Technology alone insufficient Chronic disease requires lifestyle change Not Acknowledged:\nMedicaid cuts may exceed transformation benefits Hospital closures may accelerate despite investment Employment depends on job availability, not just health Five-year timeline insufficient for generational change Conclusion West Virginia’s RHTP application represents the most ambitious attempt in state history to transform health from a barrier to an asset. The Health to Prosperity vision correctly identifies the circular relationship between poor health, workforce nonparticipation, and economic stagnation. The seven initiatives address real barriers: geographic isolation, provider shortages, transportation gaps, chronic disease burden, substance use disorder, outdated technology, and limited innovation capacity.\nThe plan builds on existing infrastructure including WVU Medicine’s findhelp integration, WVSOM’s CHERP CHW training, Marshall University’s chronic care management model, and emerging community paramedicine capacity. It leverages West Virginia’s concentrated rural population to direct resources toward a defined geography rather than spreading thin across diverse regions.\nThe fundamental question is whether $199 million annually can accomplish what the plan envisions while Medicaid cuts extract $6.6 billion over the same decade. The math does not reconcile. Hospitals already operating on negative margins will face accelerating losses regardless of technology upgrades. Coverage losses will reduce patient volume and revenue. Workforce pipeline graduates will face employment in a system under financial stress.\nPart 3 of this analysis examines what works, what struggles, and what survives under the resource constraints West Virginia faces. The seven initiatives represent what the state can build with what it received. Whether what it received is sufficient to accomplish what it promised remains the essential question.\nCross-References RHTP 3.WV.1: West Virginia, The Problem RHTP 3.WV.3: West Virginia, The Analysis (forthcoming) RHTP 2.A: RHTP Structure and Rules RHTP 2.B: Medicaid Architecture and the $911 Billion Question RHTP 2.H: The 2030 Cliff RHTP 3.OH: Ohio (Appalachian comparison) RHTP 3.KY: Kentucky (Appalachian comparison) RHTP 3.PA: Pennsylvania (neighboring state) RHTP 3.VA: Virginia (neighboring state) Series 4.D: Community Health Workers Series 4.C: Telehealth Series 10.D: Appalachian Kentucky Regional Deep Dive Sources Center for Health Care Strategies. “Leveraging Community Health Workers to Address Rural Health Care Needs.” CHCS, 14 Oct. 2025, www.chcs.org/resource/leveraging-community-health-workers-to-address-rural-health-care-needs/.\nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services. “CMS Announces $50 Billion in Awards to Strengthen Rural Health in All 50 States.” CMS Newsroom, 29 Dec. 2025, www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-announces-50-billion-awards-strengthen-rural-health-all-50-states.\nDouglas, Eric. “Rural Health Transformation Application Submitted.” West Virginia Public Broadcasting, 5 Nov. 2025, wvpublic.org/story/government/rural-health-transformation-application-submitted/.\nDouglas, Eric. “State Receives Nearly $200 Million In Rural Health Program First Year.” West Virginia Public Broadcasting, 29 Dec. 2025, wvpublic.org/story/health-science/state-receives-nearly-200-million-in-rural-health-program-first-year/.\nDouglas, Eric. “W.Va.

  </a>
</div>

<p>Part 1 established the baseline: <strong>$199.5 million for approximately 1.1 million rural West Virginians</strong> translates to $181 per person annually, among the highest per capita allocations in the nation. Fifteen rural hospitals face closure risk. Six face immediate closure within three years. West Virginia leads the nation in deaths from cancer, drug overdose, diabetes, and kidney disease. Life expectancy dropped nearly two years in 2021. The workforce participation rate ranks near the bottom nationally, and <strong>poor health is the primary reason West Virginians cite for not working</strong>.</p>
<p>West Virginia responded with seven flagship initiatives under Governor Patrick Morrisey&rsquo;s <strong>Health to Prosperity</strong> vision, a framework that positions health improvement as the prerequisite for economic revival. The application, developed with assistance from <strong>McKinsey and Company</strong> at a cost of $2 million, received endorsement from more than <strong>40 healthcare organizations</strong> and incorporated feedback from more than <strong>17,000 residents</strong> who participated in a statewide tele-townhall.</p>
<p>The strategic approach reflects West Virginia&rsquo;s unique position as the only state located entirely within Appalachia, where nearly the entire population qualifies as rural and where health challenges compound across generations. Unlike larger states that must allocate resources across diverse regional needs, West Virginia can concentrate investment on a smaller population facing concentrated crisis. Whether this concentration of need and investment produces transformation or merely delays decline depends on implementation choices that begin now.</p>
<p><strong>The central premise</strong>: health improvement drives workforce participation, workforce participation drives economic revival, and economic revival creates the sustainable tax base necessary to maintain health systems beyond RHTP&rsquo;s five-year window. This circular logic requires each component to function for any component to succeed.</p>

<h3 id="governance-structure">Governance Structure<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#governance-structure">#</a></h3>
<p>The <strong>West Virginia Department of Health (WVDOH)</strong> serves as lead agency for all RHTP implementation. Governor Morrisey designated the Department of Health rather than the Department of Health and Human Resources, reflecting organizational restructuring that separated public health functions from human services administration. <strong>Dr. Arvin Singh</strong>, Secretary of Health, bears primary responsibility for program direction and outcomes.</p>
<p>Within days of the December 29, 2025 award announcement, Dr. Singh announced the Department was actively recruiting leadership for the Rural Health Transformation Program. The recruitment call emphasized seeking physicians, nurses, administrators, and leaders with experience in health systems transformation.</p>

<p>The governance structure centralizes authority within the Department of Health while allowing for distributed implementation through subawards. The state indicated funding will flow through <strong>a mix of competitive grants and direct state agency awards</strong>, suggesting some initiatives will use procurement processes while others will direct funds to established partners.</p>
<h3 id="theory-of-change">Theory of Change<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#theory-of-change">#</a></h3>
<p>The West Virginia application operates on an <strong>integrated transformation theory</strong> that connects healthcare improvement to economic recovery. The logic model:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Health barriers drive workforce nonparticipation.</strong> Poor health, chronic disease, substance use disorder, and disability are the primary reasons West Virginians cite for not working. Addressing these barriers requires accessible healthcare.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Healthcare requires access infrastructure.</strong> Rural West Virginians cannot reach care due to geographic isolation, transportation barriers, and provider shortages. The Connected Care Grid and Rural Health Link address access barriers directly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Access requires workforce.</strong> No technology can replace the need for healthcare providers. The Mountain State Care Force builds the pipeline of physicians, nurses, and allied health professionals the state needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sustainability requires payment reform.</strong> Fee-for-service payment perpetuates volume over value. Smart Care Catalyst equips providers with tools and incentives to shift toward value-based models that reward outcomes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Prevention reduces treatment burden.</strong> The chronic diseases devastating West Virginia are largely preventable through lifestyle modification. The Personal Health Accelerator invests in upstream prevention aligned with Governor Morrisey&rsquo;s four-pillar health initiative and federal <strong>Make America Healthy Again (MAHA)</strong> priorities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Recovery enables productivity.</strong> The Health to Prosperity Pipeline explicitly connects substance use disorder recovery, care management, and employment support, treating recovery as the pathway to workforce participation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Innovation creates opportunity.</strong> HealthTech Appalachia positions West Virginia as a hub for rural health innovation, creating economic activity and potentially attracting investment and talent.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The theory&rsquo;s vulnerabilities include the <strong>timeline mismatch</strong> between five-year RHTP funding and the decade-long investments required for workforce development, the <strong>Medicaid offset problem</strong> where projected $6.6 billion in cuts over ten years may overwhelm $1 billion in transformation investment, and the assumption that <strong>improved health translates to employment</strong> in a state where job opportunities themselves remain limited.</p>
<h3 id="core-initiatives-and-interrelationships">Core Initiatives and Interrelationships<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#core-initiatives-and-interrelationships">#</a></h3>
<p>The seven initiatives form a conceptual ecosystem, though implementation reality will test whether theoretical integration holds:</p>
<p><strong>Access Layer</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Connected Care Grid provides virtual and mobile care delivery</li>
<li>Rural Health Link solves transportation barriers to physical care sites</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Workforce Layer</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Mountain State Care Force builds provider pipeline</li>
<li>Health to Prosperity Pipeline connects recovery to employment</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Technology Layer</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Smart Care Catalyst modernizes provider operations</li>
<li>HealthTech Appalachia incubates innovation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Prevention Layer</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Personal Health Accelerator addresses chronic disease upstream</li>
</ul>
<p>Each initiative depends on others for full effect. Telehealth without workforce produces virtual waiting rooms. Transportation without destination providers moves patients to facilities that cannot serve them. Workforce without sustainable payment models produces providers who leave for better-compensated positions elsewhere. The plan requires coordinated execution across all seven initiatives, a significant implementation challenge for a state agency building program capacity from scratch.</p>

<p>The flagship access initiative builds infrastructure to bring care to people rather than requiring people to travel to care. West Virginia&rsquo;s mountainous terrain, winding roads, and dispersed population make traditional facility-based care delivery inherently inefficient. The Connected Care Grid addresses this through four integrated components:</p>
<p><strong>Telehealth Expansion</strong>: Video consultation capacity extended to rural hospitals, clinics, FQHCs, and community access points. The initiative builds on existing telehealth infrastructure developed during COVID-19 while addressing persistent broadband gaps that limit connectivity in the most remote communities. Integration with WVU Medicine and Marshall Health telehealth networks extends specialist access to rural sites.</p>
<p><strong>Remote Patient Monitoring</strong>: Home-based devices transmitting vital signs, blood glucose, weight, oxygen saturation, and other metrics to care teams. Targets patients with chronic conditions including diabetes, heart failure, COPD, and hypertension, enabling intervention before acute episodes require emergency care or hospitalization. The CHW-based chronic care management model developed in Mingo County provides a template for integrating remote monitoring with community health worker support.</p>
<p><strong>Mobile Care Units</strong>: Vehicles equipped for clinical service delivery traveling to underserved communities on scheduled routes. Mobile units bring primary care, dental services, behavioral health, and screening programs to communities lacking fixed facilities. Coordination with EMS and transportation networks ensures mobile units complement rather than duplicate other services.</p>
<p><strong>EMS Treatment-in-Place</strong>: Expands the role of paramedics and EMTs to provide <strong>community paramedicine</strong> and <strong>mobile integrated healthcare (MIH)</strong> services. Rather than transporting all 911 callers to emergency departments, trained EMS personnel can assess patients at home, provide treatment, and connect them to appropriate care resources. The West Virginia Office of Emergency Medical Services has supported MIH/CP training through Mountwest Community and Technical College, providing the foundation for expanded deployment.</p>

<p><strong>Broadband constraints</strong> remain significant. Deployment of telehealth and remote monitoring requires connectivity that does not exist in portions of rural West Virginia. The initiative must coordinate with BEAD Program broadband buildout timelines, potentially sequencing deployments to match infrastructure availability.</p>

<p>Transportation is cited as a barrier to care in virtually every assessment of West Virginia&rsquo;s rural health challenges. Patients miss appointments because rides do not arrive. Dialysis patients requiring three-times-weekly treatment travel hours on mountain roads. Pregnant women in southern counties may travel 60 or more miles for prenatal care. Rural Health Link creates <strong>unified health mobility infrastructure</strong> addressing these barriers.</p>
<p><strong>One-Stop Scheduling Platform</strong>: A single point of access connecting patients to all available transportation resources. Currently, patients must navigate separately among non-emergency medical transportation (NEMT) through Medicaid, public transit where available, community ride programs, volunteer driver networks, and informal family support. The platform integrates these resources into a unified system allowing patients to schedule rides through one interface.</p>
<p><strong>Vehicle and Driver Grants</strong>: Competitive awards to expand local and regional transportation capacity. Grant recipients may include county transit authorities, community action agencies, faith-based organizations, and other entities with transportation infrastructure that can be expanded for health-related trips.</p>
<p><strong>Data-Driven Coordination</strong>: Integration with EMS dispatch, hospital discharge planning, and clinic scheduling to optimize routing and reduce costs. The platform captures transportation demand data enabling better resource allocation and identification of underserved areas.</p>

<p>West Virginia faces <strong>severe workforce shortages</strong> across primary care, mental health, dental health, nursing, and allied health professions. Most rural counties carry Health Professional Shortage Area designations. The Mountain State Care Force addresses shortages through recruitment, training, and retention strategies:</p>
<p><strong>Rural Residency Expansion</strong>: Increased training positions in family medicine, internal medicine, psychiatry, and other specialties at rural sites. Physicians who train in rural areas are more likely to practice in rural areas. The initiative expands graduate medical education capacity beyond Charleston and Morgantown.</p>
<p><strong>Loan Forgiveness Programs</strong>: Building on existing programs including West Virginia Higher Education Policy Commission&rsquo;s $40,000 loan forgiveness for medical students committing to rural practice. RHTP funding expands eligibility and increases award amounts.</p>
<p><strong>Return-to-Home Scholarships</strong>: In-state tuition for out-of-state students who commit to equal years of rural practice in West Virginia, implementing <strong>HB 4768</strong> passed in 2024. The initiative provides additional support beyond tuition including living expenses and training costs.</p>
<p><strong>Learn and Earn Apprenticeships</strong>: Entry-level healthcare jobs through community college partnerships creating pathways for West Virginians to enter healthcare careers without relocating for extended education.</p>
<p><strong>Community Health Worker Expansion</strong>: Training and employment support for CHWs who provide culturally appropriate outreach, navigation, and care coordination. West Virginia has existing CHW infrastructure through the <strong>WVSOM Center for Rural and Community Health CHERP program</strong> and Marshall University&rsquo;s CHW training.</p>

<p><strong>Level 1: Federal to State</strong>
CMS transfers RHTP cooperative agreement funds to WVDOH on an agreed schedule, typically quarterly or based on expenditure reporting. The $199,476,099 FY2026 award represents the first year of a projected five-year commitment.</p>
<p><strong>Level 2: State Agency Administration</strong>
WVDOH retains approximately <strong>6-8% ($12-16 million)</strong> for program administration including staffing, evaluation, reporting, and technical assistance. The Department establishes initiative-specific budgets and subaward structures.</p>
<p><strong>Level 3: Intermediary Distribution</strong>
Major intermediaries (Hospital Association, Primary Care Association, academic medical centers) receive block allocations for defined activities including network coordination, technical assistance, and pass-through to members.</p>
<p><strong>Level 4: Competitive Subawards</strong>
Individual providers, CBOs, and other eligible entities compete for awards within initiative categories. Competitive processes determine which organizations receive funding for specific projects.</p>
<p><strong>Level 5: Performance-Based Adjustments</strong>
Subaward agreements include performance milestones. Continued funding depends on demonstrated progress. Poorly performing subawardees may face reduced allocations in subsequent periods.</p>

<p>The seven initiatives function as an integrated system when properly coordinated:</p>
<p><strong>Connected Care Grid + Mountain State Care Force</strong>: Telehealth requires providers. Workforce development creates the clinicians who staff virtual and in-person care. Rural residency expansion creates specialists available for teleconsultation.</p>
<p><strong>Connected Care Grid + Rural Health Link</strong>: Patients who cannot travel physically can access virtual care. Patients requiring in-person services receive transportation. The unified scheduling platform coordinates both modalities.</p>
<p><strong>Mountain State Care Force + Health to Prosperity Pipeline</strong>: Workforce development includes entry-level pathways. Health-to-work programs create candidates for healthcare apprenticeships. Recovery graduates become community health workers.</p>
<p><strong>Smart Care Catalyst + Connected Care Grid</strong>: Technology grants enable telehealth infrastructure. Data systems support remote monitoring. Value-based care models create financial sustainability for transformed delivery.</p>
<p><strong>Personal Health Accelerator + Health to Prosperity Pipeline</strong>: Prevention programs improve population health. Healthier individuals become employable. Employment provides income supporting healthy lifestyle choices.</p>
<p><strong>HealthTech Appalachia + All Initiatives</strong>: Innovation accelerator incubates tools supporting other initiatives. AI clinical decision support enhances Connected Care Grid. Digital engagement tools support Personal Health Accelerator.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>West Virginia&rsquo;s RHTP application represents the most ambitious attempt in state history to <strong>transform health from a barrier to an asset</strong>. The Health to Prosperity vision correctly identifies the circular relationship between poor health, workforce nonparticipation, and economic stagnation. The seven initiatives address real barriers: geographic isolation, provider shortages, transportation gaps, chronic disease burden, substance use disorder, outdated technology, and limited innovation capacity.</p>
<p>The plan builds on existing infrastructure including WVU Medicine&rsquo;s findhelp integration, WVSOM&rsquo;s CHERP CHW training, Marshall University&rsquo;s chronic care management model, and emerging community paramedicine capacity. It leverages West Virginia&rsquo;s concentrated rural population to direct resources toward a defined geography rather than spreading thin across diverse regions.</p>
<p><strong>The fundamental question is whether $199 million annually can accomplish what the plan envisions while Medicaid cuts extract $6.6 billion over the same decade.</strong> The math does not reconcile. Hospitals already operating on negative margins will face accelerating losses regardless of technology upgrades. Coverage losses will reduce patient volume and revenue. Workforce pipeline graduates will face employment in a system under financial stress.</p>
<p>Part 3 of this analysis examines what works, what struggles, and what survives under the resource constraints West Virginia faces. The seven initiatives represent what the state can build with what it received. Whether what it received is sufficient to accomplish what it promised remains the essential question.</p>
