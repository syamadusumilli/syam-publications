  "articleBody": "On December 29, 2025, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced that North Carolina would receive $213 million from the Rural Health Transformation Program for fiscal year 2026. Governor Josh Stein celebrated the award as supporting “innovations to help make rural communities healthier,” noting that rural communities face “unique health care challenges” that the funding would address.\nThe celebration carried an unusual undertone. North Carolina’s press release acknowledged what few state announcements dared to mention: the state “will need to overcome significant funding losses as a result of federal reconciliation law H.R. 1, including the loss of nearly $50 billion in federal funds to North Carolina’s Medicaid program over the next 10 years.” The Rural Health Transformation Program would replace only about half of the $3.7 billion North Carolina’s rural hospitals will lose from Medicaid cuts in the same legislation that created the transformation fund.\nNorth Carolina occupies a distinctive position in the RHTP landscape. The state has the second largest rural population in the nation, trailing only Texas. Nearly 3 million residents live across 85 rural counties. Divide the award by roughly 2.2 million rural residents using stricter federal definitions, and North Carolina receives approximately $97 per person annually. More than many states but far less than the small states that benefit from the formula’s equal distribution floor.\nThe timing compounds the complexity. North Carolina expanded Medicaid on December 1, 2023, becoming the 40th state to accept the Affordable Care Act’s expansion provisions. More than 650,000 people have enrolled in expansion coverage, with over 233,000 from rural communities. The expansion stabilized rural hospital finances after decades of decline. Now federal Medicaid cuts threaten to unwind that stability precisely as transformation funds arrive to build on it.\nPart 1 of this three-part analysis establishes the baseline: what crisis North Carolina faces, what funding it receives, and what the collision between expansion success and impending cuts means for transformation. North Carolina is attempting to transform rural healthcare while the financial foundation beneath it shifts.\nThe Baseline Crisis Hospital Infrastructure Under Pressure North Carolina has approximately 130 rural hospitals serving communities across the state, supported by networks of rural health clinics, federally qualified health centers, and critical access hospitals. The state has experienced fewer closures than the hardest-hit states in the Southeast, but fragility persists beneath apparent stability.\nMartin General Hospital in Williamston became the most prominent recent casualty. After 73 years serving Martin County’s 22,000 residents, the hospital abruptly closed on August 3, 2023. Quorum Healthcare, the facility’s owner, announced bankruptcy and shuttered the emergency department with two hours’ notice. Staff learned at an 8:30 a.m. meeting that the hospital would stop accepting patients at 10 a.m.\nThe closure left residents driving 22 to 30 miles to the nearest emergency care at ECU Health Beaufort. Martin County now ranks among the least healthy counties in North Carolina, with life expectancy four years below the state average. The community is attempting an unprecedented effort to reopen the facility as the nation’s first Rural Emergency Hospital converted from a fully closed hospital.\nAngel Medical Center and Blue Ridge Regional Hospital in the western mountains face different but related challenges. Both Mission Health system facilities had three consecutive years of negative profit margins, placing them on national lists of hospitals at risk from Medicaid cuts. HCA Healthcare, which purchased Mission Health for $1.5 billion in 2019, says it remains committed to keeping both facilities open. But the Sheps Center analysis that identified them as at-risk reflects structural vulnerabilities that good intentions cannot automatically resolve.\nPungo District Hospital in Belhaven closed in 2014, catalyzing national attention to rural hospital closures when a resident who needed emergency care died during the longer drive now required to reach care. The closure became a symbol of what communities lose when hospitals disappear, influencing federal policy discussions that eventually produced the Rural Emergency Hospital designation and the RHTP itself.\nThe Expansion Paradox North Carolina’s Medicaid expansion represents both the state’s greatest recent achievement in healthcare access and its greatest vulnerability under the new federal policy environment.\nExpansion launched December 1, 2023, after years of political resistance finally gave way to bipartisan agreement. Within 12 months, over 600,000 people enrolled, reaching the state’s projected two-year target in half the expected time. By April 2025, enrollment exceeded 650,000 people.\nThe rural impact was disproportionately positive. More than one in three newly eligible enrollees came from rural communities. Counties like Anson, Edgecombe, Richmond, and Robeson saw the highest percentages of adult populations gain coverage. In some rural counties, more than 12 percent of the adult population gained health insurance through expansion.\nFor rural hospitals operating on thin margins, expansion meant more patients arrived with coverage instead of generating uncompensated care. The financial stabilization was immediate and measurable. NC Medicaid covered $86 million in dental services alone for the expansion population, services previously delayed or forgone. 6.1 million prescriptions were filled for heart health, diabetes, seizures, and other conditions.\nBut the same legislation that created the Rural Health Transformation Program also enacted the largest Medicaid cuts in program history. North Carolina’s $49.9 billion in projected losses over ten years includes coverage restrictions, work requirements, and reimbursement reductions that threaten to reverse expansion’s gains.\nRural hospitals that finally achieved financial breathing room now face uncertainty about whether that stability will persist. Transformation planning occurs against this backdrop of success potentially undone.\nWorkforce Shortages Across the Care Continuum North Carolina designates over 70 areas as Health Professional Shortage Areas for primary care, covering millions of residents who lack adequate access to physicians. Mental health HPSAs blanket even larger portions of the state. Dental HPSAs affect communities from the mountains to the coast.\nThe state’s physician-to-population ratio has improved from 23.3 per 10,000 in 2014 to 26.1 per 10,000 in 2024. But the improvement concentrates in urban and suburban counties. Rural areas see slower growth and face the compounding challenge of an aging workforce. Rural physicians are older on average than their urban counterparts, meaning retirement waves will hit rural areas harder.\nThe primary care shortage is projected to reach 396 physicians between 2025 and 2030 under current trends. This gap exists despite significant investment in medical education and residency training. North Carolina produces physicians, but they do not distribute evenly across the state’s geography.\nNursing shortages follow similar patterns. The NC Healthcare Association’s 2024 Workforce Report documented regional variation in nursing supply, with the largest projected shortages in areas already struggling with access. Inadequate pay for nursing instructors limits the pipeline expansion that could address shortages over time.\nThe workforce crisis extends beyond physicians and nurses. Behavioral health providers are scarce throughout rural North Carolina. Dental professionals concentrate in metropolitan areas while rural counties lack adequate coverage. Community health workers, who could extend the reach of clinical providers, exist in insufficient numbers to meet community needs.\nGeographic Complexity North Carolina spans 500 miles from the Appalachian Mountains to the Outer Banks, encompassing distinct regions with different healthcare challenges.\nThe Mountain Region includes some of the state’s most isolated communities, where terrain complicates emergency response and specialty access. Mission Health’s network serves an 18-county region, but the for-profit conversion under HCA Healthcare has generated community concern about service sustainability. The western counties include substantial populations of older residents who moved for retirement amenities but now require healthcare infrastructure the region struggles to maintain.\nThe Piedmont contains the state’s major metropolitan areas but also includes rural counties that lack the provider density of Charlotte, Raleigh, or the Triad. These counties can appear statistically better-served than truly remote areas while residents still face meaningful access barriers.\nEastern North Carolina encompasses the state’s most persistent poverty and worst health outcomes. Martin County’s hospital closure is one manifestation of a broader pattern. Counties in this region have the highest percentages of Medicaid-enrolled adults, the lowest life expectancies, and the most limited provider options. The region’s demographics include substantial African American populations whose health disparities reflect historical underinvestment and ongoing structural barriers.\nThe Coastal Plain and Sandhills regions include military bases whose presence shapes local healthcare markets but whose populations do not always integrate with civilian systems. Fort Liberty (formerly Fort Bragg) in Cumberland County anchors a regional economy but creates workforce competition that can draw providers away from surrounding rural areas.\nThis geographic complexity means a single statewide strategy cannot address all needs equally. What works in Buncombe County will not automatically transfer to Robeson County. The RHTP funding must support approaches flexible enough to accommodate this variation.\nThe Funding Reality Award Amount and National Context North Carolina RHTP Award Summary\nMetric Value National Rank FY2026 Award $213,000,000 10th (absolute) Five-Year Projected Total ~$1.0 billion 10th (absolute) Per Rural Resident (annual) ~$97 Middle tier Per Rural Resident (five-year) ~$485 Middle tier North Carolina’s position reflects its large rural population. The state does not receive the per-capita premium that benefits small states where equal distribution produces windfalls, but neither does it suffer the extreme per-capita penalty that affects Texas. The $213 million award provides meaningful resources without providing sufficient resources.\nPer-Capita Mathematics $213 million divided by approximately 2.2 million rural North Carolinians equals roughly $97 per person per year.\nFor context, consider what $97 per person must accomplish across six proposed initiative areas:\nWorkforce development through loan repayment, training programs, and recruitment incentives Access expansion via telehealth, mobile units, and regional hub development Technology modernization including AI applications, broadband enhancement, and digital literacy Behavioral health integration addressing the mental health crisis across rural communities Chronic disease prevention through screening, wellness, and nutrition initiatives Payment model innovation transitioning rural providers toward value-based care Each initiative requires infrastructure, personnel, technology, and sustained operational funding. The $97 per person must stretch across all of them while building capacity that can survive beyond the 2030 funding expiration.\nThe Medicaid Math North Carolina’s RHTP funding faces a mathematical impossibility that state officials have acknowledged with unusual candor.\nThe Numbers:\nRHTP five-year allocation: approximately $1 billion Medicaid losses over ten years: $49.9 billion Rural hospital Medicaid losses: $3.7 billion RHTP as percentage of rural hospital losses: approximately 27% (over five years versus ten) RHTP as percentage of total Medicaid losses: approximately 2% NCDHHS explicitly stated that RHTP “would replace only about half of the $3.7 billion North Carolina rural hospitals will lose due to the Medicaid cuts in H.R. 1.” Even this calculation understates the challenge because RHTP funds are time-limited while Medicaid cuts are permanent.\nGovernor Stein acknowledged the disconnect directly: “It is without doubt that these cuts will inevitably hit rural communities hard.” Deputy Secretary Debra Farrington noted the RHTP “would not replace the funds North Carolina’s rural hospitals and providers would have received if H.R. 1 had not been signed into law.”\nThis candor is unusual among states celebrating RHTP awards. Most announcements emphasize the positive investment without quantifying what the same legislation removed. North Carolina’s acknowledgment creates both political risk and policy clarity.\nExpansion at Risk North Carolina’s Medicaid expansion success creates a specific vulnerability under H.R. 1.\nThe federal legislation includes provisions that could trigger the automatic termination of North Carolina’s expansion program. The state’s expansion law contains a fiscal safeguard: if the federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) drops below certain thresholds, expansion would terminate unless the state legislature acts to fund the gap.\nH.R. 1’s Medicaid cuts may activate this trigger. Republican legislators who reluctantly supported expansion in 2023 would need to vote for additional state spending to maintain it. The political dynamics that produced expansion may not replicate under different fiscal circumstances.\nIf expansion terminates, approximately 650,000 people would lose coverage. Rural hospitals that stabilized their finances through expansion would face renewed uncompensated care burdens. The transformation that RHTP funding is designed to enable would occur against a backdrop of coverage loss rather than coverage gain.\nThis is not a distant hypothetical. It is an active policy concern that shapes how North Carolina approaches transformation planning.\nStructural Constraints The Two-Year Obligation Window RHTP requires states to obligate funds within two years of receipt. North Carolina must commit its $213 million to specific purposes by late 2027 or risk losing unspent allocations.\nThe timeline creates tension between deliberate planning and rapid deployment. Building the infrastructure for transformation, selecting regional hub operators, establishing provider networks, and developing technology systems all require time that the obligation deadline compresses.\nNCDHHS has outlined an accelerated timeline: launching hub application processes within three months, completing selections by April through October 2026, and beginning implementation while still designing programs. This pace acknowledges regulatory requirements but creates risk that speed compromises quality.\nStates that rush to obligate funds may commit to approaches that prove ineffective. States that plan carefully may miss obligation deadlines. North Carolina is attempting to thread this needle, but the structural constraint shapes available choices.\nAdministrative Capacity Limitations The RHTP statute limits administrative costs to 10 percent of funding. For North Carolina’s $213 million award, this means no more than $21.3 million can support program administration, grant management, data collection, performance monitoring, and evaluation.\nTransforming healthcare delivery across 85 counties requires substantial coordination capacity. The state plans to operate through regional hubs organized around Medicaid managed care regions, but establishing and supporting these hubs requires administrative infrastructure.\nNCDHHS has acknowledged staffing constraints that predate RHTP. The department reduced temporary staff and contractors, ended certain contracts, and paused quality improvement projects in response to state budget pressures. Building transformation capacity requires hiring capacity that faces separate constraints.\nThe Political Environment North Carolina’s divided government creates implementation uncertainty. Governor Stein, a Democrat, leads a state with Republican legislative majorities. Bipartisan support enabled both Medicaid expansion and the RHTP application, but sustained cooperation is not guaranteed.\nThe RHTP steering committee will include NCDHHS divisions and external stakeholders, but legislative oversight of spending decisions adds a layer of political complexity. Initiatives that enjoy broad support will proceed more smoothly than those that become partisan flashpoints.\nThe state’s 2024 elections produced new leadership navigating inherited policy commitments. Governor Stein took office in January 2025, inheriting the RHTP application prepared under the previous administration. Continuity has characterized the early months, but personnel changes and priority shifts could alter implementation over the five-year program horizon.\nThe 2030 Cliff RHTP funding expires after fiscal year 2030. Whatever North Carolina builds with transformation funds must either achieve self-sustainability or disappear when federal support ends.\nThe state’s planning documents reference sustainability as a core principle. Value-based payment models are explicitly intended to create financial mechanisms that persist beyond RHTP. Workforce investments aim to recruit providers who will remain in rural communities for careers, not just for loan repayment periods.\nBut sustainability planning faces structural obstacles:\nRural hospitals that cannot achieve profitability on patient revenue alone will not suddenly become profitable in 2031 Workforce programs that rely on loan repayment end when repayment funding ends Technology investments require ongoing maintenance and upgrade costs Regional hub coordination requires sustained funding for convening and support functions The five-year window provides time to demonstrate approaches that work. It does not provide time to fundamentally alter the economics of rural healthcare delivery. North Carolina must plan now for a transition it cannot fully control.\nConclusion North Carolina faces a paradox that defines rural health transformation under current federal policy. The state expanded Medicaid successfully, enrolling hundreds of thousands of people and stabilizing rural hospital finances. Now federal policy simultaneously provides transformation funding and threatens the coverage gains that transformation could build upon.\nThe $213 million annual award sounds substantial until measured against $49.9 billion in projected Medicaid losses. The state acknowledges this math more openly than most, but acknowledgment does not resolve the structural contradiction. Transformation funding cannot offset coverage losses at this scale.\nNorth Carolina’s second-largest rural population in the nation receives middle-tier per-capita funding. $97 per person annually must support workforce development, access expansion, technology deployment, behavioral health integration, chronic disease prevention, and payment model innovation across 85 counties spanning mountains, piedmont, and coastal plain.\nPart 2 of this analysis examines what North Carolina proposes to do with these resources: the NC ROOTS hub model, the Rural Health Innovation Fund, the regional deployment strategy, and the bets the state is making about what might work. Part 3 assesses whether those bets are likely to pay off given the constraints this article has established.\nThe collision between expansion success and impending Medicaid cuts makes North Carolina a test case for whether rural health transformation can proceed while the coverage foundation beneath it erodes. What happens in North Carolina matters beyond state borders because it will demonstrate whether transformation can survive the policy contradictions embedded in its own creation.\nThree million rural North Carolinians await the results. So does everyone watching to learn what those results mean for them.\nCross-References Series 1: Understanding Rural America\n1A: Geography and Definition (rural classification systems) 1B: Demographics (aging populations, regional variation) 1D: Economics and Employment (rural economic transitions) 1E: Healthcare Access (provider shortage patterns) Series 2: Federal Policy Architecture\n2A: RHTP Structure and Rules (statutory framework, formula mechanics) 2B: Medicaid Architecture and the $911 Billion Question (coverage gap implications) 2H: The 2030 Cliff (sustainability requirements, funding expiration) Series 3: State Implementation\n3.TX: Texas (large rural population comparison) 3.GA: Georgia (southeastern region comparison) 3.SC: South Carolina (regional neighbor comparison) Sources Associated Press. “How an Empty North Carolina Rural Hospital Explains a GOP Senator’s Vote against Trump’s Tax Bill.” Daily Press, 2 July 2025, www.dailypress.com/2025/07/02/empty-north-carolina-rural-hospital-tax-bill/.\nCasey, Morgan. “Medicaid Cuts Pose A Crisis For Rural North Carolina Hospitals.” The Assembly, 12 Nov. 2025, www.theassemblync.com/news/health/north-carolina-medicaid-reimbursement-cuts-rural-hospitals/.\nCBS News. “Rural North Carolina County Is Set to Reopen Its Shuttered Hospital with Help from a New Federal Program.” CBS News, 16 Sept. 2024, www.cbsnews.com/news/martin-general-hospital-north-carolina-reopen-federal-program/.\nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services. “CMS Announces $50 Billion in Awards to Strengthen Rural Health in All 50 States.” CMS Newsroom, 29 Dec. 2025, www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-announces-50-billion-awards-strengthen-rural-health-all-50-states.\nCline, Michael. “NC to Become 7th Most Populated State in Early 2030s.” NC Office of State Budget and Management, 3 Feb. 2025, www.osbm.nc.gov/blog/2025/02/03/nc-become-7th-most-populated-state-early-2030s.\nGovernor Josh Stein. “NC Medicaid Expansion Reaches 650,000 North Carolinians Enrolled Fewer Than 18 Months After Launch.” NC Governor, 9 Apr. 2025, governor.nc.gov/news/press-releases/2025/04/09/nc-medicaid-expansion-reaches-650000-north-carolinians-enrolled-fewer-18-months-after-launch.\nGovernor Josh Stein. “North Carolina Awarded $213 Million for Rural Health Transformation Program.” NC Governor, 29 Dec. 2025, governor.nc.gov/news/press-releases/2025/12/29/north-carolina-awarded-213-million-rural-health-transformation-program.\nNC Department of Health and Human Services. “North Carolina to Apply for the Rural Health Transformation Program.” NCDHHS, 14 Aug. 2025, www.ncdhhs.gov/news/press-releases/2025/08/14/north-carolina-apply-rural-health-transformation-program.\nNC Department of Health and Human Services. “NC Rural Health Transformation Program Frequently Asked Questions.” NCDHHS, 2025, www.ncdhhs.gov/divisions/office-rural-health/rural-health-transformation-program/nc-rural-health-transformation-program-frequently-asked-questions.\nNC Department of Health and Human Services. “Understanding the Impact of Cuts to the NC Medicaid Budget.” NC Medicaid, 2025, medicaid.ncdhhs.gov/about-nc-medicaid/understanding-impact-cuts-nc-medicaid-budget.\nNC Rural Center. “Medicaid Expansion: A Rural Perspective.” NC Rural Center, Apr. 2024, www.ncruralcenter.org/2024/04/medicaid-expansion-a-rural-perspective/.\nNC Rural Center. “Rural Resurgence: Recent Population Growth in Rural N.C.” NC Rural Center, June 2024, www.ncruralcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/DRAFT3_Population.Change.2010-2023.pdf.\nNorris, Louise. “Medicaid Eligibility and Enrollment in North Carolina.” HealthInsurance.org, 26 Nov. 2025, www.healthinsurance.org/medicaid/north-carolina/.\nNorth Carolina Health News. “Rural NC County Plans to Revive Shuttered Hospital.” North Carolina Health News, 12 Aug. 2024, www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/2024/08/12/plan-to-reopen-martin-general/.\nSheps Center for Health Services Research. “Rural Hospital Closures.” University of North Carolina, Jan. 2026, www.shepscenter.unc.edu/programs-projects/rural-health/rural-hospital-closures/.\nUNC Cecil G.

<p>On December 29, 2025, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced that North Carolina would receive <strong>$213 million</strong> from the Rural Health Transformation Program for fiscal year 2026. Governor Josh Stein celebrated the award as supporting &ldquo;innovations to help make rural communities healthier,&rdquo; noting that rural communities face &ldquo;unique health care challenges&rdquo; that the funding would address.</p>
<p>The celebration carried an unusual undertone. North Carolina&rsquo;s press release acknowledged what few state announcements dared to mention: the state &ldquo;will need to overcome significant funding losses as a result of federal reconciliation law H.R. 1, including the loss of nearly <strong>$50 billion</strong> in federal funds to North Carolina&rsquo;s Medicaid program over the next 10 years.&rdquo; The Rural Health Transformation Program would replace only about half of the <strong>$3.7 billion</strong> North Carolina&rsquo;s rural hospitals will lose from Medicaid cuts in the same legislation that created the transformation fund.</p>
<p>North Carolina occupies a distinctive position in the RHTP landscape. The state has the <strong>second largest rural population</strong> in the nation, trailing only Texas. Nearly <strong>3 million residents</strong> live across 85 rural counties. Divide the award by roughly 2.2 million rural residents using stricter federal definitions, and North Carolina receives approximately <strong>$97 per person</strong> annually. More than many states but far less than the small states that benefit from the formula&rsquo;s equal distribution floor.</p>
<p>The timing compounds the complexity. North Carolina <strong>expanded Medicaid on December 1, 2023</strong>, becoming the 40th state to accept the Affordable Care Act&rsquo;s expansion provisions. More than <strong>650,000 people</strong> have enrolled in expansion coverage, with over <strong>233,000</strong> from rural communities. The expansion stabilized rural hospital finances after decades of decline. Now federal Medicaid cuts threaten to unwind that stability precisely as transformation funds arrive to build on it.</p>
<p>Part 1 of this three-part analysis establishes the baseline: what crisis North Carolina faces, what funding it receives, and what the collision between expansion success and impending cuts means for transformation. North Carolina is attempting to transform rural healthcare while the financial foundation beneath it shifts.</p>
<h2 id="the-baseline-crisis">The Baseline Crisis<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-baseline-crisis">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="hospital-infrastructure-under-pressure">Hospital Infrastructure Under Pressure<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#hospital-infrastructure-under-pressure">#</a></h3>
<p>North Carolina has approximately <strong>130 rural hospitals</strong> serving communities across the state, supported by networks of rural health clinics, federally qualified health centers, and critical access hospitals. The state has experienced fewer closures than the hardest-hit states in the Southeast, but <strong>fragility persists</strong> beneath apparent stability.</p>
<p><strong>Martin General Hospital</strong> in Williamston became the most prominent recent casualty. After 73 years serving Martin County&rsquo;s 22,000 residents, the hospital abruptly closed on August 3, 2023. Quorum Healthcare, the facility&rsquo;s owner, announced bankruptcy and shuttered the emergency department with two hours&rsquo; notice. Staff learned at an 8:30 a.m. meeting that the hospital would stop accepting patients at 10 a.m.</p>
<p>The closure left residents driving <strong>22 to 30 miles</strong> to the nearest emergency care at ECU Health Beaufort. Martin County now ranks among the <strong>least healthy counties</strong> in North Carolina, with life expectancy four years below the state average. The community is attempting an unprecedented effort to reopen the facility as the nation&rsquo;s first <strong>Rural Emergency Hospital</strong> converted from a fully closed hospital.</p>
<p><strong>Angel Medical Center</strong> and <strong>Blue Ridge Regional Hospital</strong> in the western mountains face different but related challenges. Both Mission Health system facilities had three consecutive years of negative profit margins, placing them on national lists of hospitals at risk from Medicaid cuts. HCA Healthcare, which purchased Mission Health for $1.5 billion in 2019, says it remains committed to keeping both facilities open. But the Sheps Center analysis that identified them as at-risk reflects structural vulnerabilities that good intentions cannot automatically resolve.</p>
<p><strong>Pungo District Hospital</strong> in Belhaven closed in 2014, catalyzing national attention to rural hospital closures when a resident who needed emergency care died during the longer drive now required to reach care. The closure became a symbol of what communities lose when hospitals disappear, influencing federal policy discussions that eventually produced the Rural Emergency Hospital designation and the RHTP itself.</p>
<h3 id="the-expansion-paradox">The Expansion Paradox<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-expansion-paradox">#</a></h3>
<p>North Carolina&rsquo;s <strong>Medicaid expansion</strong> represents both the state&rsquo;s greatest recent achievement in healthcare access and its greatest vulnerability under the new federal policy environment.</p>
<p>Expansion launched December 1, 2023, after years of political resistance finally gave way to bipartisan agreement. Within <strong>12 months</strong>, over <strong>600,000 people</strong> enrolled, reaching the state&rsquo;s projected two-year target in half the expected time. By April 2025, enrollment exceeded <strong>650,000 people</strong>.</p>
<p>The rural impact was disproportionately positive. More than <strong>one in three</strong> newly eligible enrollees came from rural communities. Counties like <strong>Anson, Edgecombe, Richmond, and Robeson</strong> saw the highest percentages of adult populations gain coverage. In some rural counties, more than <strong>12 percent</strong> of the adult population gained health insurance through expansion.</p>
<p>For rural hospitals operating on thin margins, expansion meant more patients arrived with coverage instead of generating uncompensated care. The financial stabilization was immediate and measurable. NC Medicaid covered <strong>$86 million in dental services</strong> alone for the expansion population, services previously delayed or forgone. <strong>6.1 million prescriptions</strong> were filled for heart health, diabetes, seizures, and other conditions.</p>
<p>But the same legislation that created the Rural Health Transformation Program also enacted the largest Medicaid cuts in program history. North Carolina&rsquo;s <strong>$49.9 billion</strong> in projected losses over ten years includes coverage restrictions, work requirements, and reimbursement reductions that threaten to reverse expansion&rsquo;s gains.</p>
<p>Rural hospitals that finally achieved financial breathing room now face uncertainty about whether that stability will persist. Transformation planning occurs against this backdrop of success potentially undone.</p>
<h3 id="workforce-shortages-across-the-care-continuum">Workforce Shortages Across the Care Continuum<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#workforce-shortages-across-the-care-continuum">#</a></h3>
<p>North Carolina designates <strong>over 70 areas</strong> as Health Professional Shortage Areas for primary care, covering millions of residents who lack adequate access to physicians. Mental health HPSAs blanket even larger portions of the state. Dental HPSAs affect communities from the mountains to the coast.</p>
<p>The state&rsquo;s physician-to-population ratio has improved from 23.3 per 10,000 in 2014 to 26.1 per 10,000 in 2024. But the improvement concentrates in <strong>urban and suburban counties</strong>. Rural areas see slower growth and face the compounding challenge of an <strong>aging workforce</strong>. Rural physicians are older on average than their urban counterparts, meaning retirement waves will hit rural areas harder.</p>
<p>The <strong>primary care shortage</strong> is projected to reach <strong>396 physicians</strong> between 2025 and 2030 under current trends. This gap exists despite significant investment in medical education and residency training. North Carolina produces physicians, but they do not distribute evenly across the state&rsquo;s geography.</p>
<p>Nursing shortages follow similar patterns. The <strong>NC Healthcare Association&rsquo;s 2024 Workforce Report</strong> documented regional variation in nursing supply, with the largest projected shortages in areas already struggling with access. Inadequate pay for nursing instructors limits the pipeline expansion that could address shortages over time.</p>
<p>The workforce crisis extends beyond physicians and nurses. <strong>Behavioral health providers</strong> are scarce throughout rural North Carolina. <strong>Dental professionals</strong> concentrate in metropolitan areas while rural counties lack adequate coverage. <strong>Community health workers</strong>, who could extend the reach of clinical providers, exist in insufficient numbers to meet community needs.</p>
<h3 id="geographic-complexity">Geographic Complexity<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#geographic-complexity">#</a></h3>
<p>North Carolina spans <strong>500 miles</strong> from the Appalachian Mountains to the Outer Banks, encompassing distinct regions with different healthcare challenges.</p>
<p><strong>The Mountain Region</strong> includes some of the state&rsquo;s most isolated communities, where terrain complicates emergency response and specialty access. Mission Health&rsquo;s network serves an 18-county region, but the for-profit conversion under HCA Healthcare has generated community concern about service sustainability. The western counties include substantial populations of older residents who moved for retirement amenities but now require healthcare infrastructure the region struggles to maintain.</p>
<p><strong>The Piedmont</strong> contains the state&rsquo;s major metropolitan areas but also includes rural counties that lack the provider density of Charlotte, Raleigh, or the Triad. These counties can appear statistically better-served than truly remote areas while residents still face meaningful access barriers.</p>
<p><strong>Eastern North Carolina</strong> encompasses the state&rsquo;s most persistent poverty and worst health outcomes. Martin County&rsquo;s hospital closure is one manifestation of a broader pattern. Counties in this region have the highest percentages of Medicaid-enrolled adults, the lowest life expectancies, and the most limited provider options. The region&rsquo;s demographics include substantial <strong>African American populations</strong> whose health disparities reflect historical underinvestment and ongoing structural barriers.</p>
<p><strong>The Coastal Plain</strong> and <strong>Sandhills</strong> regions include military bases whose presence shapes local healthcare markets but whose populations do not always integrate with civilian systems. Fort Liberty (formerly Fort Bragg) in Cumberland County anchors a regional economy but creates workforce competition that can draw providers away from surrounding rural areas.</p>
<p>This geographic complexity means a single statewide strategy cannot address all needs equally. What works in Buncombe County will not automatically transfer to Robeson County. The RHTP funding must support approaches flexible enough to accommodate this variation.</p>

<p>North Carolina&rsquo;s position reflects its large rural population. The state does not receive the <strong>per-capita premium</strong> that benefits small states where equal distribution produces windfalls, but neither does it suffer the extreme per-capita penalty that affects Texas. The $213 million award provides meaningful resources without providing sufficient resources.</p>
<h3 id="per-capita-mathematics">Per-Capita Mathematics<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#per-capita-mathematics">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>$213 million divided by approximately 2.2 million rural North Carolinians equals roughly $97 per person per year.</strong></p>
<p>For context, consider what $97 per person must accomplish across six proposed initiative areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Workforce development</strong> through loan repayment, training programs, and recruitment incentives</li>
<li><strong>Access expansion</strong> via telehealth, mobile units, and regional hub development</li>
<li><strong>Technology modernization</strong> including AI applications, broadband enhancement, and digital literacy</li>
<li><strong>Behavioral health integration</strong> addressing the mental health crisis across rural communities</li>
<li><strong>Chronic disease prevention</strong> through screening, wellness, and nutrition initiatives</li>
<li><strong>Payment model innovation</strong> transitioning rural providers toward value-based care</li>
</ul>
<p>Each initiative requires infrastructure, personnel, technology, and sustained operational funding. The $97 per person must stretch across all of them while building capacity that can survive beyond the 2030 funding expiration.</p>
<h3 id="the-medicaid-math">The Medicaid Math<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-medicaid-math">#</a></h3>
<p>North Carolina&rsquo;s RHTP funding faces a <strong>mathematical impossibility</strong> that state officials have acknowledged with unusual candor.</p>
<p><strong>The Numbers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>RHTP five-year allocation: approximately <strong>$1 billion</strong></li>
<li>Medicaid losses over ten years: <strong>$49.9 billion</strong></li>
<li>Rural hospital Medicaid losses: <strong>$3.7 billion</strong></li>
<li>RHTP as percentage of rural hospital losses: approximately <strong>27%</strong> (over five years versus ten)</li>
<li>RHTP as percentage of total Medicaid losses: approximately <strong>2%</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>NCDHHS explicitly stated that RHTP &ldquo;would replace only about half of the $3.7 billion North Carolina rural hospitals will lose due to the Medicaid cuts in H.R. 1.&rdquo; Even this calculation understates the challenge because RHTP funds are time-limited while Medicaid cuts are permanent.</p>
<p>Governor Stein acknowledged the disconnect directly: &ldquo;It is without doubt that these cuts will inevitably hit rural communities hard.&rdquo; Deputy Secretary Debra Farrington noted the RHTP &ldquo;would not replace the funds North Carolina&rsquo;s rural hospitals and providers would have received if H.R. 1 had not been signed into law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This candor is unusual among states celebrating RHTP awards. Most announcements emphasize the positive investment without quantifying what the same legislation removed. North Carolina&rsquo;s acknowledgment creates both political risk and policy clarity.</p>
<h3 id="expansion-at-risk">Expansion at Risk<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#expansion-at-risk">#</a></h3>
<p>North Carolina&rsquo;s Medicaid expansion success creates a <strong>specific vulnerability</strong> under H.R. 1.</p>
<p>The federal legislation includes provisions that could trigger the <strong>automatic termination</strong> of North Carolina&rsquo;s expansion program. The state&rsquo;s expansion law contains a fiscal safeguard: if the federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) drops below certain thresholds, expansion would terminate unless the state legislature acts to fund the gap.</p>
<p>H.R. 1&rsquo;s Medicaid cuts may activate this trigger. Republican legislators who reluctantly supported expansion in 2023 would need to vote for additional state spending to maintain it. The political dynamics that produced expansion may not replicate under different fiscal circumstances.</p>
<p>If expansion terminates, approximately <strong>650,000 people</strong> would lose coverage. Rural hospitals that stabilized their finances through expansion would face renewed uncompensated care burdens. The transformation that RHTP funding is designed to enable would occur against a backdrop of coverage loss rather than coverage gain.</p>
<p>This is not a distant hypothetical. It is an active policy concern that shapes how North Carolina approaches transformation planning.</p>
<h2 id="structural-constraints">Structural Constraints<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#structural-constraints">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="the-two-year-obligation-window">The Two-Year Obligation Window<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-two-year-obligation-window">#</a></h3>
<p>RHTP requires states to <strong>obligate funds within two years</strong> of receipt. North Carolina must commit its $213 million to specific purposes by late 2027 or risk losing unspent allocations.</p>
<p>The timeline creates tension between <strong>deliberate planning</strong> and <strong>rapid deployment</strong>. Building the infrastructure for transformation, selecting regional hub operators, establishing provider networks, and developing technology systems all require time that the obligation deadline compresses.</p>
<p>NCDHHS has outlined an accelerated timeline: launching hub application processes within three months, completing selections by April through October 2026, and beginning implementation while still designing programs. This pace acknowledges regulatory requirements but creates risk that speed compromises quality.</p>
<p>States that rush to obligate funds may commit to approaches that prove ineffective. States that plan carefully may miss obligation deadlines. North Carolina is attempting to thread this needle, but the structural constraint shapes available choices.</p>
<h3 id="administrative-capacity-limitations">Administrative Capacity Limitations<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#administrative-capacity-limitations">#</a></h3>
<p>The RHTP statute limits <strong>administrative costs to 10 percent</strong> of funding. For North Carolina&rsquo;s $213 million award, this means no more than $21.3 million can support program administration, grant management, data collection, performance monitoring, and evaluation.</p>
<p>Transforming healthcare delivery across 85 counties requires substantial coordination capacity. The state plans to operate through <strong>regional hubs</strong> organized around Medicaid managed care regions, but establishing and supporting these hubs requires administrative infrastructure.</p>
<p>NCDHHS has acknowledged staffing constraints that predate RHTP. The department reduced temporary staff and contractors, ended certain contracts, and paused quality improvement projects in response to state budget pressures. Building transformation capacity requires hiring capacity that faces separate constraints.</p>
<h3 id="the-political-environment">The Political Environment<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-political-environment">#</a></h3>
<p>North Carolina&rsquo;s <strong>divided government</strong> creates implementation uncertainty. Governor Stein, a Democrat, leads a state with Republican legislative majorities. Bipartisan support enabled both Medicaid expansion and the RHTP application, but sustained cooperation is not guaranteed.</p>
<p>The RHTP steering committee will include NCDHHS divisions and external stakeholders, but legislative oversight of spending decisions adds a layer of political complexity. Initiatives that enjoy broad support will proceed more smoothly than those that become partisan flashpoints.</p>
<p>The state&rsquo;s <strong>2024 elections</strong> produced new leadership navigating inherited policy commitments. Governor Stein took office in January 2025, inheriting the RHTP application prepared under the previous administration. Continuity has characterized the early months, but personnel changes and priority shifts could alter implementation over the five-year program horizon.</p>
<h2 id="the-2030-cliff">The 2030 Cliff<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-2030-cliff">#</a></h2>
<p>RHTP funding expires after fiscal year 2030. Whatever North Carolina builds with transformation funds must either achieve <strong>self-sustainability</strong> or disappear when federal support ends.</p>
<p>The state&rsquo;s planning documents reference sustainability as a core principle. Value-based payment models are explicitly intended to create <strong>financial mechanisms</strong> that persist beyond RHTP. Workforce investments aim to recruit providers who will remain in rural communities for careers, not just for loan repayment periods.</p>
<p>But sustainability planning faces structural obstacles:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rural hospitals</strong> that cannot achieve profitability on patient revenue alone will not suddenly become profitable in 2031</li>
<li><strong>Workforce programs</strong> that rely on loan repayment end when repayment funding ends</li>
<li><strong>Technology investments</strong> require ongoing maintenance and upgrade costs</li>
<li><strong>Regional hub coordination</strong> requires sustained funding for convening and support functions</li>
</ul>
<p>The five-year window provides time to demonstrate approaches that work. It does not provide time to fundamentally alter the economics of rural healthcare delivery. North Carolina must plan now for a transition it cannot fully control.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>North Carolina faces a paradox that defines rural health transformation under current federal policy. The state expanded Medicaid successfully, enrolling hundreds of thousands of people and stabilizing rural hospital finances. Now federal policy simultaneously provides transformation funding and threatens the coverage gains that transformation could build upon.</p>
<p>The $213 million annual award sounds substantial until measured against $49.9 billion in projected Medicaid losses. The state acknowledges this math more openly than most, but acknowledgment does not resolve the structural contradiction. Transformation funding cannot offset coverage losses at this scale.</p>
<p>North Carolina&rsquo;s second-largest rural population in the nation receives middle-tier per-capita funding. $97 per person annually must support workforce development, access expansion, technology deployment, behavioral health integration, chronic disease prevention, and payment model innovation across 85 counties spanning mountains, piedmont, and coastal plain.</p>
<p>Part 2 of this analysis examines what North Carolina proposes to do with these resources: the NC ROOTS hub model, the Rural Health Innovation Fund, the regional deployment strategy, and the bets the state is making about what might work. Part 3 assesses whether those bets are likely to pay off given the constraints this article has established.</p>
<p>The collision between expansion success and impending Medicaid cuts makes North Carolina a test case for whether rural health transformation can proceed while the coverage foundation beneath it erodes. What happens in North Carolina matters beyond state borders because it will demonstrate whether transformation can survive the policy contradictions embedded in its own creation.</p>
<p>Three million rural North Carolinians await the results. So does everyone watching to learn what those results mean for them.</p>
