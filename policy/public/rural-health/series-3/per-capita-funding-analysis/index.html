  "articleBody": "This technical document provides deep examination of the scale penalty problem in RHTP funding distribution. The analysis demonstrates how the statutory funding formula systematically disadvantages states with large rural populations while creating per-capita windfalls for states with small rural populations.\nPer-capita funding varies nearly 100-fold across states, from approximately $66 per rural resident in Texas to over $6,300 per rural resident in Rhode Island. This disparity fundamentally shapes what transformation is possible in each state and represents either deliberate political design or structural policy failure depending on interpretive framework.\nPart I: Funding Formula Mechanics Statutory Two-Part Structure Public Law 119-21 established a two-part allocation formula distributing $10 billion annually:\nComponent Amount Distribution Method Result Baseline (50%) $5 billion Equal distribution to all approved states $100 million per state Workload (50%) $5 billion Rurality metrics and application scores Variable by state The equal distribution component creates the scale penalty. A state with 100,000 rural residents receives the same $100 million baseline as a state with 5 million rural residents. Per-capita funding from the baseline alone ranges from $1,000 per resident (small rural population) to $20 per resident (large rural population) before any workload factors apply.\nWorkload Allocation Factors CMS distributes the workload portion based on multiple factors, with weights disclosed in the Notice of Funding Opportunity:\nRurality and State Need (approximately 50% of workload funding)\nFactor Weight Within Category Favored States Land area (5 largest states) 12% AK, TX, CA, MT, NM Share of population in rural areas 12% Percentage-based, not absolute Share of population in frontier regions 12% Extreme isolation states Number of rural health facilities Variable States with more CAHs, RHCs, FQHCs Medicaid DSH hospital share 20% States with high DSH payments (2021 data) Technical Application Scores (approximately 50% of workload funding)\nFactor Weight Within Category Assessment Transformation plan quality Variable CMS technical review MAHA policy alignment Variable SNAP restrictions, fitness test, prevention Stakeholder engagement Variable Documentation of consultation Prior program performance Variable Flex, SHIP, other rural health programs What the Formula Rewards The formula creates systematic advantages for states with:\nGeographic characteristics:\nLarge land area relative to population High percentage of population in rural areas (not absolute rural population) Frontier designation (under 6 persons per square mile) Extreme isolation metrics (FAR Level 3-4) Policy alignment:\nSNAP purchase restrictions adopted or proposed Presidential Fitness Test commitment Prevention and chronic disease initiatives MAHA priorities in application narrative Formula design does not reward:\nAbsolute rural population size Health outcomes or mortality rates Hospital closure risk or vulnerability Coverage gaps or uninsured rates Poverty concentration or persistent poverty counties Part II: Per-Capita Calculation Methodology Data Sources Per-capita calculations require consistent rural population definitions. This analysis uses:\nPrimary Source: KFF analysis using Sheps Center rural population data (CMS definition for RHTP formula purposes)\nSecondary Verification: Census Bureau American Community Survey, USDA ERS rural-urban classifications\nAward Data: CMS December 29, 2025 announcement as compiled by U.S. Chamber of Commerce\nCalculation Formula Per-Capita Funding = FY2026 RHTP Award / Rural Population (CMS definition)\rFive-Year Per-Capita = (FY2026 Award Ã— 5) / Rural Population Note: Five-year projections assume constant annual awards, though actual awards will be recalculated annually based on state performance and compliance.\nDefinition Considerations Rural population definitions vary across federal agencies. The CMS definition for RHTP purposes differs from:\nCensus Bureau rural definition (all territory outside urbanized areas) USDA ERS nonmetro definition (counties outside metropolitan statistical areas) State-specific definitions used in some applications Consistency note: All per-capita figures in this document use the CMS definition as applied in formula calculations, based on Sheps Center data.\nPart III: State-by-State Per-Capita Ranking Complete Per-Capita Table (FY2026) Rank State FY2026 Award Rural Population Per Rural Resident 1 Rhode Island $156,169,931 24,770 $6,305 2 New Jersey $147,250,806 137,825 $1,069 3 Alaska $272,174,856 274,924 $990 4 Connecticut $154,249,106 195,000 $791 5 Delaware $157,384,964 213,000 $739 6 Massachusetts $162,005,238 238,000 $681 7 Wyoming $205,004,743 370,000 $554 8 South Dakota $189,477,607 369,000 $513 9 New Hampshire $204,016,550 430,000 $474 10 Hawaii $188,892,440 420,000 $450 11 Montana $233,509,359 550,000 $425 12 Vermont $195,053,740 460,000 $424 13 North Dakota $198,936,970 500,000 $398 14 Maryland $168,180,838 450,000 $374 15 Nevada $179,931,608 520,000 $346 16 Florida $209,938,195 662,000 $317 17 Maine $190,008,051 620,000 $306 18 Nebraska $218,529,075 720,000 $303 19 Idaho $185,974,368 640,000 $290 20 Utah $195,743,566 680,000 $288 21 Colorado $200,105,604 730,000 $274 22 Kansas $221,898,008 867,000 $256 23 Oregon $197,271,578 780,000 $253 24 New Mexico $211,484,471 840,000 $252 25 Oklahoma $223,476,949 930,000 $240 26 Arizona $166,988,956 720,000 $232 27 West Virginia $199,476,099 870,000 $229 28 Iowa $209,040,064 960,000 $218 29 Washington $181,257,515 1,120,000 $162 30 Arkansas $208,779,396 1,300,000 $161 31 Louisiana $208,374,448 1,350,000 $154 32 Minnesota $193,090,618 1,280,000 $151 33 Wisconsin $203,670,005 1,400,000 $145 34 Mississippi $205,907,220 1,598,000 $129 35 South Carolina $200,030,252 1,600,000 $125 36 Indiana $206,927,897 1,700,000 $122 37 Kentucky $212,905,591 1,870,000 $114 38 Missouri $216,276,818 1,900,000 $114 39 Virginia $189,544,888 1,700,000 $111 40 Pennsylvania $193,294,054 1,800,000 $107 41 New York $212,058,208 2,000,000 $106 42 Alabama $203,404,327 2,100,000 $97 43 Tennessee $206,888,882 2,400,000 $86 44 California $233,639,308 2,700,000 $87 45 Michigan $173,128,201 2,000,000 $87 46 Illinois $193,418,216 2,200,000 $88 47 Ohio $202,030,262 2,800,000 $72 48 Georgia $218,862,170 2,900,000 $75 49 North Carolina $213,008,356 3,400,000 $63 50 Texas $281,319,361 4,300,000 $65 Source: FY2026 awards from CMS December 29, 2025 announcement. Rural population from KFF analysis using Sheps Center data. Per-capita calculated.\nDistribution by Funding Tier Tier Per-Capita Range States Count Extreme High Over $500 RI, NJ, AK, CT, DE, MA, WY, SD 8 High $300 to $500 NH, HI, MT, VT, ND, MD, NV, FL, ME, NE 10 Moderate $150 to $300 ID, UT, CO, KS, OR, NM, OK, AZ, WV, IA, WA, AR, LA, MN, WI 15 Low $100 to $150 MS, SC, IN, KY, MO, VA, PA, NY 8 Very Low Under $100 AL, TN, CA, MI, IL, OH, GA, NC, TX 9 KFF finding: Ten states receive less than $100 per rural resident while eight states receive more than $500 per rural resident.\nPart IV: Disparity Analysis The 100-Fold Gap The ratio between highest and lowest per-capita funding approaches 100:1 when comparing Rhode Island ($6,305) to Texas ($65). Even excluding Rhode Island as an extreme outlier, the ratio between New Jersey ($1,069) and Texas ($65) exceeds 16:1.\nComparison High Low Ratio Rhode Island vs. Texas $6,305 $65 97:1 New Jersey vs. Texas $1,069 $65 16:1 Alaska vs. Texas $990 $65 15:1 Wyoming vs. Texas $554 $65 9:1 Median state vs. Texas ~$200 $65 3:1 Five-Year Projection Disparities Assuming constant annual awards, five-year per-capita disparities compound:\nState Five-Year Total Five-Year Per Capita Rhode Island $780.8M $31,525 New Jersey $736.3M $5,345 Alaska $1.36B $4,950 Wyoming $1.03B $2,770 Texas $1.41B $325 California $1.17B $433 North Carolina $1.07B $315 Wyoming receives $2,770 per rural resident over five years. Texas receives $325. Wyoming’s rural population of 370,000 receives nearly as much total funding as Texas’s rural population of 4.3 million.\nInverse Relationship with Health Need The Penn Leonard Davis Institute analysis for Senator Ron Wyden’s office found that states with the lowest rural mortality rates receive approximately twice as much RHTP funding per rural resident as states with the highest rural mortality rates.\nHealth Outcome Category Average Per-Capita Funding Representative States Lowest mortality rates ~$400 NH, VT, HI, CO Moderate mortality rates ~$200 National average Highest mortality rates ~$100 MS, AL, WV, KY The formula rewards geographic sparsity and policy alignment rather than health crisis severity.\nPart V: Geographic vs. Population Weighting Effects How Equal Distribution Creates Scale Penalty The $100 million baseline per state creates automatic per-capita advantage for small-population states:\nState Rural Population Baseline Per Capita Baseline as % of Total Award Rhode Island 24,770 $4,037 64% Texas 4,300,000 $23 36% Alaska 274,924 $364 37% California 2,700,000 $37 43% Rhode Island receives more from the baseline alone ($4,037 per resident) than Texas receives in total ($65 per resident).\nWorkload Factors Compound Rather Than Correct The workload portion uses percentage-based rurality metrics rather than absolute population:\nExample: Montana and Texas both have significant rural populations, but Montana’s rural population represents a higher percentage of state population. The formula rewards Montana’s 44% rural share over Texas’s 17% rural share, even though Texas has eight times more rural residents.\nState Rural Population Rural % of State Workload Advantage Montana 550,000 52% High (percentage-based) Texas 4,300,000 15% Low (percentage-based) Mississippi 1,598,000 54% High (percentage-based) California 2,700,000 7% Very Low (percentage-based) Frontier and FAR Code Effects Frontier designation (under 6 persons per square mile) and Frontier and Remote Area (FAR) codes provide additional weighting:\nFAR Level Criteria Advantaged States FAR 1 Urban core accessible Minimal advantage FAR 2 Large town accessible Moderate advantage FAR 3 Small town accessible Significant advantage FAR 4 Most isolated Maximum advantage Alaska, Wyoming, Montana, and Nevada contain significant FAR Level 3-4 territory, receiving formula benefits unavailable to states with concentrated rural populations like Texas or California.\nPart VI: Rural Population Definitions and Impact Definition Variation Rural population counts vary by definition:\nState Census Rural USDA Nonmetro CMS RHTP Definition Texas 3.1M 2.8M 4.3M California 2.0M 1.4M 2.7M Florida 1.2M 0.5M 0.66M New York 2.2M 1.7M 2.0M CMS uses broader definitions than USDA in some states, affecting per-capita calculations. The broader definition typically reduces per-capita funding by increasing the denominator.\nImpact on State Rankings Definition choice affects ranking position. Using narrower USDA nonmetro definitions would:\nIncrease Florida’s per-capita funding (smaller denominator) Decrease Texas’s per-capita ranking slightly Potentially shift several states between tiers This document uses CMS definitions for consistency with RHTP formula applications.\nPart VII: Policy Implications What Scale Penalty Means for Implementation States receiving under $100 per rural resident face fundamentally different implementation contexts:\nChallenge High Per-Capita State Low Per-Capita State Transformation scope Comprehensive Limited pilots Program reach Statewide Regional targeting Workforce investment Sustained pipelines One-time recruitment Technology deployment Infrastructure build Equipment only Sustainability Achievable Uncertain Texas cannot accomplish what Alaska can with available funding despite facing more hospital closures, larger coverage gaps, and higher preventable mortality.\nAlternative Formula Scenarios Scenario A: Pure Population-Based Allocation\nIf $10 billion were allocated purely by rural population (46 million nationally):\nState Rural Population Allocation Per Capita Texas 4,300,000 $935M $217 North Carolina 3,400,000 $739M $217 Rhode Island 24,770 $5.4M $217 Alaska 274,924 $60M $217 Result: Equal per-capita funding across all states. Small states receive dramatically less total funding.\nScenario B: Need-Weighted Allocation\nIf allocation weighted by mortality rates, hospital risk, and coverage gaps:\nState Health Need Score Illustrative Allocation Per Capita Mississippi Highest ~$400M $250 Texas Very High ~$700M $163 Alaska Moderate ~$100M $364 Rhode Island Low ~$20M $808 Result: Higher per-capita funding for high-need states; formula would reward crisis severity rather than geography.\nScenario C: Hybrid 25/75 (Current Law Baseline Reduced)\nIf baseline reduced to 25% with 75% workload allocation emphasizing absolute population:\nComponent Current Scenario C Equal distribution 50% ($5B) 25% ($2.5B) Population-weighted 5% 35% Rurality metrics 20% 20% Technical scores 25% 20% Result: Reduced scale penalty; large rural states receive more proportionate funding while small states retain floor.\nPolitical Reality The current formula reflects legislative compromise, not optimal policy design.\nSenator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) was instrumental in program creation and secured formula provisions benefiting Alaska. Every senator wanted substantial funding for their state regardless of rural population size. Pure population-based allocation would have concentrated 80% of funding in 15 states, making passage politically impossible.\nThe formula is working as designed politically even if it creates inequitable per-capita outcomes.\nFormula Reform Advocacy Organizations advocating formula modification face structural barriers:\nBarrier Description Statutory requirement Formula is in law, not regulation; change requires legislation Political coalition Small-state senators benefit from current formula Timing Program already distributing funds; mid-stream changes disrupt planning Reauthorization Program expires 2030; reform opportunity in reauthorization NRHA and other advocacy organizations have noted formula inequities but focused on program utilization rather than formula reform given short-term implementation timeline.\nPart VIII: Analytical Applications Using Per-Capita Data in State Profiles Each Series 3 state profile should document:\nPer-Capita Funding Block\nFY2026 Award: [Amount]\rRural Population: [Count]\rPer Rural Resident: [Calculated]\rNational Ranking: [1-50]\rFunding Tier: [Extreme High/High/Moderate/Low/Very Low]\rFive-Year Per Capita: [Projected] Transformation Capacity Classification Per-Capita Tier Transformation Capacity Implementation Expectation Over $500 Comprehensive Statewide transformation achievable $300 to $500 Strong Major initiatives across multiple domains $150 to $300 Moderate Targeted transformation with regional gaps $100 to $150 Limited Demonstration projects, select initiatives Under $100 Constrained Pilot programs, supplements to existing efforts Cross-Reference Matrix Per-Capita Tier Typical Medicaid Gap Class Implementation Outlook Over $500 Often Positive Resources adequate for transformation $300 to $500 Often Low Strong position for meaningful change $150 to $300 Often Moderate Viable transformation with triage $100 to $150 Often Moderate to Severe Significant constraints Under $100 Often Severe to Extreme RHTP insufficient for need Methodology Notes Data Sources Primary Sources\nCMS December 29, 2025 press release and state award table KFF analysis “First-Year Rural Health Fund Awards” (January 6, 2026) KFF pre-award analysis “State Awards From Most of the Rural Health Fund” (December 5, 2025) UNC Sheps Center rural population and technical score data Penn Leonard Davis Institute Senate Finance Committee analysis Secondary Sources\nU.S. Chamber of Commerce state award compilation Hall Render funding formula analysis (January 6, 2026) State RHTP application materials where publicly available Calculation Limitations Per-capita calculations carry limitations:\nRural population definitions vary; this analysis uses CMS RHTP definitions Annual awards will be recalculated; five-year projections assume constant allocation Technical score component changes annually based on state performance Some rural population estimates carry uncertainty ranges Ranking precision note: States with similar per-capita values (within $10) should be considered equivalent for analytical purposes.

<p>This technical document provides <strong>deep examination of the scale penalty problem</strong> in RHTP funding distribution. The analysis demonstrates how the statutory funding formula systematically disadvantages states with large rural populations while creating per-capita windfalls for states with small rural populations.</p>
<p><strong>Per-capita funding varies nearly 100-fold across states</strong>, from approximately $66 per rural resident in Texas to over $6,300 per rural resident in Rhode Island. This disparity fundamentally shapes what transformation is possible in each state and represents either deliberate political design or structural policy failure depending on interpretive framework.</p>

<p><strong>The equal distribution component creates the scale penalty.</strong> A state with 100,000 rural residents receives the same $100 million baseline as a state with 5 million rural residents. Per-capita funding from the baseline alone ranges from $1,000 per resident (small rural population) to $20 per resident (large rural population) before any workload factors apply.</p>

<p>The formula creates systematic advantages for states with:</p>
<p><strong>Geographic characteristics:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Large land area relative to population</li>
<li>High percentage of population in rural areas (not absolute rural population)</li>
<li>Frontier designation (under 6 persons per square mile)</li>
<li>Extreme isolation metrics (FAR Level 3-4)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Policy alignment:</strong></p>

<li>SNAP purchase restrictions adopted or proposed</li>
<li>Presidential Fitness Test commitment</li>
<li>Prevention and chronic disease initiatives</li>
<li>MAHA priorities in application narrative</li>

<p>The workload portion uses percentage-based rurality metrics rather than absolute population:</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Montana and Texas both have significant rural populations, but Montana&rsquo;s rural population represents a higher <strong>percentage</strong> of state population. The formula rewards Montana&rsquo;s 44% rural share over Texas&rsquo;s 17% rural share, even though Texas has eight times more rural residents.</p>

<p><strong>The current formula reflects legislative compromise, not optimal policy design.</strong></p>
<p>Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) was instrumental in program creation and secured formula provisions benefiting Alaska. Every senator wanted substantial funding for their state regardless of rural population size. Pure population-based allocation would have concentrated 80% of funding in 15 states, making passage politically impossible.</p>
