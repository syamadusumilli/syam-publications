  "articleBody": "is_summary: true Rural Health Transformation Project Version 3: January 2026\nPurpose This technical document provides cross-cutting analysis of social care integration across all 50 states under the Rural Health Transformation Program. The document serves three functions:\nInventory what states proposed for SDOH screening, HRSN navigation, CHW deployment, and CIE platforms Assess what survived partial funding decisions and implementation prioritization Identify vendor landscape gaps and procurement opportunities for technology providers and intermediaries Social care components rank among the most vulnerable RHTP elements. Rural hospital CEOs consistently rank social determinants work around 15th on priority lists, behind workforce, technology, and operational concerns. This document tracks which states protected social care investment and which allowed these components to erode under budget pressure.\nAnalytical Framework Key Definitions\nSDOH (Social Determinants of Health): The conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live, and age that shape health outcomes. Includes economic stability, education, social and community context, health care access, and neighborhood/built environment.\nHRSN (Health-Related Social Needs): The individual-level social needs affecting a patient’s health, such as food insecurity, housing instability, transportation barriers, and utility difficulties. HRSN work involves screening for these needs and connecting patients to resources.\nCHW (Community Health Worker): A frontline public health worker who is a trusted member of the community served. CHWs serve as liaisons between health services and the community, providing culturally appropriate health education, informal counseling, social support, and advocacy.\nCIE (Community Information Exchange): A network of multidisciplinary organizations that use a shared technology platform to collaborate on social care referrals. CIE enables closed-loop referrals where the outcome of a referral is tracked and reported back to the referring organization.\nAssessment Categories\nCategory Definition Funded Social care components clearly preserved with dedicated budget lines Partial Some components funded, others reduced or deprioritized At Risk Included in application but vulnerable to implementation cuts Cut Explicitly removed or defunded post-award Embedded Social care included within other initiatives without dedicated funding Unknown Insufficient public documentation to assess Section 1: SDOH/HRSN Initiative Inventory Priority States: Detailed Assessment State SDOH Screening HRSN Navigation Integration Model Funding Requested Funding Allocated Status Texas Yes (digital tools) Limited Data capture focus Not specified ~$15-20M embedded Partial California Yes (CalAIM) Yes Platform-mediated ~$35-50M ~$20-30M At Risk Mississippi Unknown Implicit in CRIS Embedded Not explicit Unknown Uncertain Ohio Limited Limited Pathways HUB model Not explicit Unknown At Risk Georgia Not funded Not funded None None None Cut Tennessee Yes (TN Community Compass) Yes (LHD Navigators) Platform-mediated ~$20-25M ~$20-25M Funded Kentucky Yes Yes (Chronic Care Hubs) Hub-based ~$15-20M ~$15-20M Funded Alabama Embedded in CRIS Embedded Hub-based Not explicit Unknown At Risk Arkansas Unknown Unknown Unknown Not public Unknown Unknown North Carolina Yes Yes (Hubs + NCCARE360) Platform-mediated ~$25-35M ~$20-30M Funded Oklahoma Limited Limited Managed care-based Not explicit Unknown At Risk West Virginia Yes (Connected Care Grid) Yes (CHW expansion) CHW-based ~$10-15M ~$10-15M Funded Standard States: Summary Assessment State SDOH Component Integration Model Status Pennsylvania Unknown Unknown Unknown New York Unknown Unknown Unknown Michigan Unknown Unknown Unknown Missouri Limited Embedded At Risk Wisconsin Yes CIE + CHW + Tech Funded Minnesota Unknown Unknown Unknown Indiana Unknown Unknown Unknown Virginia Unknown Unknown Unknown Iowa Yes (Communities of Care) Co-location sites At Risk Illinois Unknown Unknown Unknown South Carolina Unknown Unknown Unknown Louisiana Unknown Unknown Unknown Washington Yes (MCO-based) Managed care + AAA Partial Oregon Yes CCO-mediated Funded Arizona Unknown Unknown Unknown Colorado Unknown Unknown Unknown New Mexico Unknown Unknown Unknown Kansas Unknown Unknown Unknown Nebraska Unknown Unknown Unknown Montana Limited CONNECT (NobleSG) At Risk North Dakota Embedded Wellness programs At Risk South Dakota Unknown Unknown Unknown Wyoming Unknown Unknown Unknown Idaho Unknown Unknown Unknown Utah Unknown Unknown Unknown Nevada Unknown Unknown Unknown Maine Unknown Unknown Unknown Vermont Yes Blueprint for Health Funded New Hampshire Unknown Unknown Unknown Alaska Unknown Unknown Unknown Florida Unknown Unknown Unknown New Jersey Unknown Unknown Unknown Massachusetts Unknown Unknown Unknown Connecticut Unknown Unknown Unknown Rhode Island Unknown Unknown Unknown Delaware Unknown Unknown Unknown Maryland Unknown Unknown Unknown Hawaii Unknown Unknown Unknown Integration Model Categories\nModel Description Example States Platform-mediated CIE technology drives referrals between clinical and social services NC, TN, OR Hub-based Regional hubs coordinate social care within defined geographies KY, AL Managed care-based MCOs contract for SDOH services; RHTP supplements WA, OK CHW-based Community health workers provide navigation without dedicated platform WV Embedded Social care included within clinical initiatives without distinct infrastructure TX, MS None No social care integration funded GA Section 2: Community Health Worker Programs Priority States: CHW Deployment Analysis State CHW Initiative FTE Target Training Pipeline Employer Model Funding Status Texas Yes (distinct) 500 new + 300 employed Existing certification Hybrid (FQHC, LHD, CBO, MCO) $9-12M Funded California Yes (regional) ~250-400 Community college + FQHC Hybrid $8-12M At Risk Mississippi Not explicit Unknown Unknown Unknown Unknown Uncertain Ohio Limited 50-100 (est.)

care components survived funding decisions. Analysis draws from:\nPublic CMS award announcements State application summaries and budget narratives Post-award communications from state agencies News coverage of implementation priorities Limitation: Many states have not released detailed budget breakdowns post-award. This analysis represents best available information as of January 2026.\nPriority States: Social Care Survival Assessment State Total Award Social Care Status Key Components Preserved Components Cut/At Risk Texas $281M Partial SDOH screening (embedded), CHW deployment CIE platform, closed-loop referrals California $234M At Risk SDOH screening (CalAIM), CHW (priority regions) Full CIE deployment, regional coverage Mississippi $206M Uncertain Unknown All social care components status unclear Ohio $202M At Risk Pathways HUB (existing) No dedicated SDOH investment Georgia $219M Cut None SDOH, CHW, CIE all absent from plan Tennessee $207M Funded TN Community Compass, CHW, navigation Minor scope reductions possible Kentucky $213M Funded Chronic care hubs, CHW, 211 integration Full deployment uncertain Alabama $203M At Risk Embedded in CRIS Standalone infrastructure absent Arkansas $209M Unknown Unknown Unknown North Carolina $213M Funded NCCARE360, CHW, hub-based navigation HOP continuation uncertain Oklahoma $223M Partial CHW (tribal), MCO SDOH Statewide coordination West Virginia $199M Funded CHW expansion, findhelp integration Statewide CIE coverage Social Care Prioritization Patterns States with Strong Social Care Protection\nState Evidence of Protection Key Factor Tennessee Existing TN Community Compass, dedicated funding Pre-existing infrastructure North Carolina NCCARE360 operational, hub model includes SDOH Platform maturity Oregon CCO mandate for social care, Unite Us deployed Medicaid integration Wisconsin CHW Medicaid SPA pathway, 211 investment Sustainability planning West Virginia CHW expansion central to strategy Academic partnerships Kentucky Chronic care hubs include navigation Hub design requirement States with Weak or Absent Social Care Investment\nState Evidence of Weak Investment Consequence Georgia No SDOH, CHW, or CIE in plan Complete gap Texas Data capture without service delivery Screening without resolution Ohio Fragmented platforms, no coordination Persistent siloing Mississippi Absence from public documentation Status unknown Correlation with Medicaid Expansion Status Expansion Status States with Strong SDOH States with Weak SDOH Pattern Expansion states NC, OR, WA, KY, WV OH Strong positive correlation Non-expansion states TN (exception) TX, GA, MS, AL Negative correlation Interpretation: Medicaid expansion states show stronger social care integration overall. The Tennessee exception (non-expansion with strong social care) reflects pre-existing TennCare infrastructure and deliberate state investment. Non-expansion states generally prioritize clinical infrastructure over social care, reflecting both philosophy and resource constraints.\nSection 5: Technology Vendor Landscape Market Structure Analysis Tier 1: National CIE Platforms\nVendor 2025 Valuation State Contracts RHTP Positioning Rural Capability Unite Us $1.6B+ 43+ states Strong Moderate (urban origin) Findhelp $200M+ (est.)

<em>Rural Health Transformation Project</em>
<em>Version 3: January 2026</em></p>
<h2 id="purpose">Purpose<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#purpose">#</a></h2>
<p>This technical document provides <strong>cross-cutting analysis of social care integration</strong> across all 50 states under the Rural Health Transformation Program. The document serves three functions:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Inventory what states proposed</strong> for SDOH screening, HRSN navigation, CHW deployment, and CIE platforms</li>
<li><strong>Assess what survived</strong> partial funding decisions and implementation prioritization</li>
<li><strong>Identify vendor landscape gaps</strong> and procurement opportunities for technology providers and intermediaries</li>
</ol>
<p>Social care components rank among the <strong>most vulnerable RHTP elements</strong>. Rural hospital CEOs consistently rank social determinants work around 15th on priority lists, behind workforce, technology, and operational concerns. This document tracks which states protected social care investment and which allowed these components to erode under budget pressure.</p>
<h2 id="analytical-framework">Analytical Framework<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#analytical-framework">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Key Definitions</strong></p>
<p><strong>SDOH (Social Determinants of Health):</strong> The conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live, and age that shape health outcomes. Includes economic stability, education, social and community context, health care access, and neighborhood/built environment.</p>
<p><strong>HRSN (Health-Related Social Needs):</strong> The individual-level social needs affecting a patient&rsquo;s health, such as food insecurity, housing instability, transportation barriers, and utility difficulties. HRSN work involves screening for these needs and connecting patients to resources.</p>
<p><strong>CHW (Community Health Worker):</strong> A frontline public health worker who is a trusted member of the community served. CHWs serve as liaisons between health services and the community, providing culturally appropriate health education, informal counseling, social support, and advocacy.</p>
<p><strong>CIE (Community Information Exchange):</strong> A network of multidisciplinary organizations that use a shared technology platform to collaborate on social care referrals. CIE enables closed-loop referrals where the outcome of a referral is tracked and reported back to the referring organization.</p>

<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> Medicaid expansion states show <strong>stronger social care integration</strong> overall. The Tennessee exception (non-expansion with strong social care) reflects pre-existing TennCare infrastructure and deliberate state investment. Non-expansion states generally prioritize clinical infrastructure over social care, reflecting both philosophy and resource constraints.</p>

<p><strong>State RHTP Applications:</strong> Where publicly available, state applications provide proposed initiative details, budget breakdowns, and social care component specifications. Availability varies significantly by state.</p>
<p><strong>CMS Announcements:</strong> CMS award announcements (December 29, 2025) provide total award figures but limited initiative-level detail.</p>
<p><strong>State Health Department Materials:</strong> Post-award communications, implementation planning documents, and stakeholder presentations provide insight into prioritization decisions.</p>
<p><strong>Vendor Announcements:</strong> Platform vendors announce state deployments and contract awards, providing visibility into CIE landscape.</p>
<p><strong>News Coverage:</strong> Regional and healthcare trade press coverage of state RHTP activities supplements official documentation.</p>
