  "articleBody": "Oregon’s geography defines its rural health challenge. The state stretches 295 miles north to south and 395 miles east to west, covering 98,381 square miles of which 86% qualifies as rural or frontier terrain. Yet this vast geography concentrates relatively few people: approximately 1.5 million Oregonians live in rural and frontier communities, representing 35% of the state’s population spread across 10 frontier counties and portions of 26 additional counties classified as rural.\nThe state received $197.3 million in first-year RHTP funding, placing it in the middle tier nationally. For a state with Oregon’s combination of geographic spread and moderate rural population, the per-capita calculation appears adequate for targeted interventions but insufficient for systemic transformation. The harder reality lies beneath the headline number: Oregon’s rural hospitals have accumulated $93 million in combined operating losses over recent years, with one-third operating at negative margins.\nRural Health Landscape Healthcare Infrastructure Oregon maintains a rural healthcare infrastructure that appears robust on paper but faces significant financial stress:\nFacility Type Count Notes Critical Access Hospitals 25 Core rural network Rural Hospitals (Total) 37 Including larger rural facilities Rural Health Clinics 65+ Primary care access points Federally Qualified Health Centers 35+ sites Safety net providers Coordinated Care Organizations 16 Regional Medicaid managed care The 25 Critical Access Hospitals form the backbone of Oregon’s rural healthcare system, but their financial position has deteriorated substantially. Approximately one-third of Oregon’s rural hospitals operate at negative margins, generating the $93 million in combined losses that threaten long-term sustainability. Cost-based reimbursement from Medicare provides some protection, but Medicaid rates and commercial payer negotiations often fail to cover actual costs of care delivery in low-volume settings.\nWorkforce Crisis Oregon’s rural workforce shortages follow national patterns while reflecting regional dynamics. The state ranks among the worst nationally for primary care access in rural areas. Oregon Office of Rural Health data documents extensive Health Professional Shortage Areas across rural and frontier counties.\nCritical gaps include:\nPrimary care physicians Mental health professionals Dentists Specialty care access Rural and frontier counties lose healthcare workers to larger urban centers, particularly Portland and the Willamette Valley. The recruitment challenge compounds retention difficulties: providers willing to work in rural Oregon often leave within five years for better compensation, professional development, or family considerations in urban areas.\nGeographic Isolation Oregon’s frontier designation captures what rural fails to convey. Ten counties qualify as frontier with six or fewer people per square mile. Residents in these areas face extraordinary distances to care:\nEastern Oregon communities may travel 100+ miles for hospital services Specialty care often requires trips to Portland, Bend, or Medford that consume entire days Emergency medical services struggle with response times across vast distances Air transport becomes essential for time-sensitive conditions The state’s topography compounds distance. The Cascade Range divides Oregon into distinct western and eastern regions with limited road connections. Winter weather regularly closes mountain passes, isolating eastern communities from western medical centers.\nPopulation Health Burden Chronic disease prevalence runs higher in rural counties, with elevated rates of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic respiratory conditions. Behavioral health needs are acute, with rural suicide rates exceeding urban rates and substance use disorders straining limited treatment capacity. Oral health access remains severely limited, with multiple rural counties designated as dental care deserts.\nThe state’s aging rural population accelerates these challenges. Seniors constitute a growing share of rural Oregon residents, bringing increased chronic disease burden and complex care needs to a system already stretched thin.\nRHTP Award and Context Metric Oregon National Average FY2026 Award $197.3 million $200 million Five-Year Projected Total ~$986 million ~$1 billion Rural Population ~1.5 million Varies Per-Capita (Rural) ~$131 ~$150 Award Rank 18th N/A Oregon’s per-capita figure of approximately $131 reflects the formula’s tension between population and geography. States with larger absolute rural populations receive more total dollars but less per resident. States with sparse populations scattered across vast distances receive more per capita but must cover enormous geography with limited absolute funding. Oregon sits uncomfortably in the middle: enough rural residents to dilute per-capita funding, enough territory to make service delivery expensive.\nMedicaid Expansion Status: Oregon expanded Medicaid under the ACA. The Oregon Health Plan (OHP) covers approximately 1.4 million Oregonians statewide. Rural residents rely heavily on Medicaid, with 26%+ of rural residents enrolled.\nMedicaid Cut Exposure: Oregon faces estimated cuts of $600+ million in Medicaid funding over 10 years under H.R. 1 provisions. These cuts will disproportionately affect rural providers already operating at negative margins. The RHTP award of $197.3 million annually, while significant, covers only a portion of projected Medicaid losses.\nState Approach Governance Structure Oregon Health Authority (OHA) serves as the lead agency with a governance model that leverages existing infrastructure:\nOregon Office of Rural Health (ORH) at OHSU provides technical assistance, data analysis, and coordination support. The Office has decades of experience supporting rural facilities and brings established relationships with rural hospitals and clinics.\nCoordinated Care Organizations (CCOs) serve as regional implementation partners. Oregon’s 16 CCOs already manage Medicaid beneficiaries under capitated contracts and have experience with value-based payment, population health, and regional coordination.\nTribal Nations receive explicit inclusion in the governance framework, with consultation requirements and dedicated funding considerations for the state’s nine federally recognized tribes.\nStrategic Framework Oregon’s application organizes transformation around four state-led initiatives:\nInitiative Focus Area Estimated Allocation Access Points and Services Facility support, EMS, specialists ~35% Workforce Development Recruitment, training, retention ~30% Technology and Innovation Telehealth, data systems, AI tools ~20% Prevention and Chronic Disease Population health, CCO alignment ~15% The distribution signals Oregon’s recognition that workforce and access points represent the binding constraints. Technology investments without clinicians to use them deliver limited value. Prevention programs require providers to implement them.\nPhased Deployment Oregon’s application structures implementation in two major phases:\nPhase 1 (2026-2027): Catalyst Awards\nRapid deployment to projects ready for immediate implementation Planning grants for regional partnerships requiring development time Focus on initiatives with existing infrastructure Phase 2 (2028-2030): Sustainable Systems\nLarger collaborative projects demonstrating long-term viability Regional network development Shared infrastructure investments OHA designated certain projects for Immediate Impact Awards that bypass competitive application, targeting projects directly supporting one-year CMS metrics.\nProgram and Funding Distribution Program Allocation (Est.) Implementing Organization Focus Rural Facility Sustainability $50 million OHA/Hospital Association Direct payments tied to quality metrics and financial improvement Workforce Recruitment/Retention $35 million ORH/OHSU Loan repayment, preceptor development, retention incentives EMS Enhancement $20 million Regional Partnerships Equipment, training, coordination Telehealth Infrastructure $25 million OHA/CCOs Broadband support, equipment, platform standardization Specialty Access Expansion $15 million OHSU/Regional Systems Visiting specialists, telehealth connections CCO Prevention Programs $18 million 16 CCOs Population health, chronic disease management Community Health Worker Expansion $12 million CCOs/CBOs Rural CHW deployment, training SDOH Screening and Referral $10 million CCOs/Community Partners Screening systems, referral coordination Mobile Health Deployment $7 million Regional Providers Communities lacking fixed facilities Administrative/Oversight $5 million OHA CMS reporting, performance monitoring Note: Allocations estimated from application priorities. CCO-administered programs represent significant funding stream.\nSocial Care Integration Oregon’s application includes explicit social determinants components integrated within the Prevention and Chronic Disease initiative. The state’s CCO infrastructure provides established channels for SDOH work.\nComponent Included in Plan Funding (Est.) Vendor/Operator Likely Funded? SDOH/HRSN Screening Yes ~$10 million CCOs Yes HRSN Navigation Yes ~$8 million CCOs/CBOs At Risk CHW Deployment Yes ~$12 million CCOs/Regional Partners Yes CIE Platform Yes Existing infrastructure Unite Us (Connect Oregon) Yes SDOH Screening and Navigation Oregon’s 16 Coordinated Care Organizations already implement SDOH screening and referral under existing OHA contracts. RHTP investments enhance these capabilities for rural populations with limited CCO penetration.\nThe state’s approach embeds SDOH within CCO-administered programs rather than creating parallel infrastructure. This model leverages existing relationships but creates implementation gaps in areas where CCO presence is weak.\nCommunity Health Worker Programs CHW deployment receives dedicated funding through the Prevention and Chronic Disease initiative. Oregon’s approach focuses on:\nRural CHW expansion through CCO partnerships Training pipeline development via community colleges Supervision integration within primary care practices Cultural competency for tribal and agricultural worker populations The state’s existing CHW certification program provides regulatory framework. WWAMI (Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana, Idaho) participation through OHSU connects CHW training to broader regional workforce development.\nCHW employer model: CCOs and FQHCs serve as primary employers with clinical supervision. No dedicated CHW intermediary proposed.\nTechnology Platform Status Oregon has existing statewide CIE infrastructure through Connect Oregon, a coordinated care network powered by Unite Us. RHTP does not require major new platform procurement because most CCOs already participate in Connect Oregon.\nConnect Oregon (Unite Us): The majority of Oregon’s 16 CCOs use Unite Us through Connect Oregon for closed-loop referrals and HRSN service coordination. Participating CCOs include Samaritan Health Services/IHN-CCO, PacificSource, CareOregon, Columbia Pacific CCO, Jackson Care Connect, Health Share of Oregon, AllCare Health, EOCCO, Yamhill Community Care, Advanced Health, Umpqua Health Alliance, and Trillium. The network has processed nearly $4 million in HRSN services through the platform as of mid-2025.\nFindhelp: A small number of CCOs use Findhelp as an alternative platform. OHA maintains Statewide Price Agreements with both Unite Us and Findhelp to accommodate CCO preferences.\n211info: Serves as the coordination center for Connect Oregon, providing resource directory maintenance and community engagement support.\nRHTP technology focus: Funds prioritize EHR optimization and health information exchange expansion rather than CIE platform procurement, given existing infrastructure.\nKey Subawardees Organization Type Contract Value (Est.) Role in RHTP Implementation Oregon Office of Rural Health (OHSU) Academic/TA $15 million Technical assistance, data analysis, stakeholder convening Oregon Primary Care Association Intermediary $12 million FQHC coordination, workforce pipeline Oregon Association of Hospitals Intermediary $10 million Hospital network coordination, quality improvement Coordinated Care Organizations (16) Regional Partners $60 million Population health, VBP implementation, SDOH OHSU Health System Academic Partner $25 million Telehealth hub, residency expansion, specialist access Regional Health Systems Provider Networks $30 million Providence, Legacy, Samaritan rural affiliates Area Health Education Centers Workforce $8 million Training pipeline development Community-Based Organizations Community Partners $15 million CHW deployment, SDOH navigation Tribal Health Programs Tribal Partners $10 million Culturally appropriate care delivery CCO-Centered Implementation Oregon’s 16 CCOs represent the primary implementation channel for population health and social care investments. CCOs have:\nDecade of experience with capitated Medicaid contracts Established value-based payment infrastructure Regional coordination experience Existing SDOH screening requirements CCO variation: Implementation capacity varies significantly across CCOs. Urban-adjacent CCOs have more resources than frontier-serving organizations. RHTP must address capacity gaps in weakest CCOs.\nAcademic Partnership OHSU provides multiple implementation functions:\nOregon Office of Rural Health technical assistance Telehealth hub for specialty access Rural residency track expansion Research and evaluation capacity OHSU’s rural affiliate relationships connect smaller facilities to academic resources while maintaining local operational control.\nAssessment Strengths CCO Infrastructure: Oregon’s decade of investment in Coordinated Care Organizations provides implementation capacity that most states lack. The 16 CCOs have experience with population health, value-based payment, and regional coordination. RHTP investments can leverage this infrastructure rather than building new systems.\nOHSU Partnership: The Oregon Office of Rural Health brings established relationships with rural facilities, technical expertise in rural healthcare delivery, and research capacity to evaluate interventions. This academic-state partnership provides continuity regardless of political changes.\nPhased Deployment: The two-phase structure acknowledges that communities start from different positions. Catalyst Awards get resources to ready projects quickly while planning grants develop capacity for larger investments.\nValue-Based Foundation: With 80% of state health spending tied to quality expectations, Oregon providers have experience with performance accountability. RHTP’s quality metrics align with existing CCO reporting requirements.\nSocial Care Integration: Oregon’s explicit CHW funding and CCO-administered SDOH programs represent stronger social care commitment than many state applications.\nConnect Oregon CIE Infrastructure: Most CCOs already participate in Connect Oregon, a statewide Unite Us network for closed-loop referrals. This existing infrastructure eliminates the CIE procurement challenge that other states face, allowing RHTP to focus on service delivery rather than platform buildout.\nVulnerabilities Per-Capita Limitations: At ~$131 per rural resident, Oregon’s funding falls short of what comprehensive transformation requires. The money must stretch across workforce, infrastructure, technology, and population health initiatives simultaneously.\nGeographic Dispersion: Frontier counties with six or fewer people per square mile present challenges that money cannot solve. Travel times, recruitment barriers, and service delivery costs in these areas exceed what traditional healthcare models accommodate.\nHospital Financial Position: With one-third of rural hospitals at negative margins and $93 million in combined losses, the baseline requires stabilization before transformation. RHTP funds may flow to financial rescue rather than system redesign.\nWorkforce Pipeline Duration: Training new physicians takes a decade. RHTP’s five-year timeline cannot produce enough new providers to address current shortages. Retention and recruitment of existing providers becomes essential but uncertain.\nRural CCO Capacity Variation: Implementation capacity varies significantly across CCOs. Urban-adjacent CCOs have more resources than frontier-serving organizations. RHTP must address capacity gaps in weakest CCOs to achieve statewide impact.\nSocial Care Survival Prospects SDOH Screening: Survives through existing CCO requirements and additional RHTP investment. Screening infrastructure likely to persist.\nHRSN Navigation: At risk. CCO-administered navigation competes with core medical services for attention and resources. Rural CCOs may deprioritize navigation under financial pressure.\nCHW Deployment: Likely survives. Dedicated funding stream and CCO employer model provide stability. Training pipeline remains vulnerable to budget triage.\nCIE Platform: Operational. Connect Oregon provides statewide closed-loop referral infrastructure through Unite Us. Most CCOs already participate. Platform has processed nearly $4 million in HRSN services as of mid-2025.\nThe 2030 Question Oregon’s sustainability strategy emphasizes:\nCCO Integration: Embedding RHTP-funded programs within CCO operations creates ongoing financial support through capitation rather than grant dependency.\nValue-Based Payment Expansion: Shifting more provider revenue to VBP arrangements reduces reliance on volume and creates incentives for efficiency and prevention.\nState Policy Commitments: Oregon’s application includes policy commitments around workforce scope of practice, telehealth coverage, and rural facility support that extend beyond RHTP funding.\nThe deeper question: Whether transformation proceeds fast enough. Oregon’s rural health system requires simultaneous investment in workforce, facilities, technology, and population health. Five years of historic investment can improve trajectories without fundamentally altering the economic reality of healthcare delivery in frontier America.\nConclusion Oregon’s $197.3 million RHTP award provides meaningful investment in a rural health system under significant stress. The state brings genuine advantages: a decade of CCO experience, established academic partnerships, and existing infrastructure for value-based care. The phased implementation approach reflects realistic assessment of community readiness.\nThe structural challenges remain formidable. One-third of rural hospitals operate at negative margins. Frontier counties face workforce and geography barriers that money alone cannot solve. Medicaid cuts will erode provider revenue while RHTP attempts to build new capacity.\nSocial care integration receives stronger commitment than many states, with dedicated CHW funding, CCO-administered SDOH programs, and existing CIE infrastructure through Connect Oregon. The Unite Us platform already processes HRSN referrals for most CCOs, providing closed-loop capability that many states lack.\nFor Oregon’s 1.5 million rural residents, RHTP represents opportunity and uncertainty in equal measure. The state has a plan. The CCO infrastructure exists. Whether rural Oregonians experience better healthcare depends on variables that extend beyond state borders and federal program timelines.\nCross-References\nRHTP 2A: RHTP Structure and Rules RHTP 2B: Medicaid Architecture and the $911B Question RHTP 2H: The 2030 Cliff RHTP 4B: Workforce Recruitment and Retention RHTP 4D: Community Health Workers RHTP 4H: Social Needs Integration RHTP 3.OR: Oregon Series 3: State Implementation Rural Health Transformation Project Version 3: January 2026\n",

<p>Oregon&rsquo;s geography defines its rural health challenge. The state stretches 295 miles north to south and 395 miles east to west, covering 98,381 square miles of which 86% qualifies as rural or frontier terrain. Yet this vast geography concentrates relatively few people: approximately <strong>1.5 million Oregonians live in rural and frontier communities</strong>, representing 35% of the state&rsquo;s population spread across 10 frontier counties and portions of 26 additional counties classified as rural.</p>
<p>The state received <strong>$197.3 million in first-year RHTP funding</strong>, placing it in the middle tier nationally. For a state with Oregon&rsquo;s combination of geographic spread and moderate rural population, the per-capita calculation appears adequate for targeted interventions but insufficient for systemic transformation. The harder reality lies beneath the headline number: Oregon&rsquo;s rural hospitals have accumulated <strong>$93 million in combined operating losses</strong> over recent years, with one-third operating at negative margins.</p>

<p>The 25 Critical Access Hospitals form the backbone of Oregon&rsquo;s rural healthcare system, but their financial position has deteriorated substantially. <strong>Approximately one-third of Oregon&rsquo;s rural hospitals operate at negative margins</strong>, generating the $93 million in combined losses that threaten long-term sustainability. Cost-based reimbursement from Medicare provides some protection, but Medicaid rates and commercial payer negotiations often fail to cover actual costs of care delivery in low-volume settings.</p>
<h3 id="workforce-crisis">Workforce Crisis<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#workforce-crisis">#</a></h3>
<p>Oregon&rsquo;s rural workforce shortages follow national patterns while reflecting regional dynamics. The state ranks among the worst nationally for <strong>primary care access in rural areas</strong>. Oregon Office of Rural Health data documents extensive Health Professional Shortage Areas across rural and frontier counties.</p>
<p><strong>Critical gaps include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Primary care physicians</li>
<li>Mental health professionals</li>
<li>Dentists</li>
<li>Specialty care access</li>
</ul>
<p>Rural and frontier counties lose healthcare workers to larger urban centers, particularly Portland and the Willamette Valley. The recruitment challenge compounds retention difficulties: providers willing to work in rural Oregon often leave within five years for better compensation, professional development, or family considerations in urban areas.</p>
<h3 id="geographic-isolation">Geographic Isolation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#geographic-isolation">#</a></h3>
<p>Oregon&rsquo;s frontier designation captures what rural fails to convey. Ten counties qualify as frontier with <strong>six or fewer people per square mile</strong>. Residents in these areas face extraordinary distances to care:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eastern Oregon communities may travel <strong>100+ miles</strong> for hospital services</li>
<li>Specialty care often requires trips to Portland, Bend, or Medford that consume entire days</li>
<li>Emergency medical services struggle with response times across vast distances</li>
<li>Air transport becomes essential for time-sensitive conditions</li>
</ul>
<p>The state&rsquo;s topography compounds distance. The Cascade Range divides Oregon into distinct western and eastern regions with limited road connections. Winter weather regularly closes mountain passes, isolating eastern communities from western medical centers.</p>
<h3 id="population-health-burden">Population Health Burden<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#population-health-burden">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Chronic disease prevalence</strong> runs higher in rural counties, with elevated rates of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic respiratory conditions. <strong>Behavioral health needs</strong> are acute, with rural suicide rates exceeding urban rates and substance use disorders straining limited treatment capacity. <strong>Oral health access</strong> remains severely limited, with multiple rural counties designated as dental care deserts.</p>
<p>The state&rsquo;s aging rural population accelerates these challenges. Seniors constitute a growing share of rural Oregon residents, bringing increased chronic disease burden and complex care needs to a system already stretched thin.</p>

<p>Oregon&rsquo;s per-capita figure of approximately <strong>$131 reflects the formula&rsquo;s tension between population and geography</strong>. States with larger absolute rural populations receive more total dollars but less per resident. States with sparse populations scattered across vast distances receive more per capita but must cover enormous geography with limited absolute funding. Oregon sits uncomfortably in the middle: enough rural residents to dilute per-capita funding, enough territory to make service delivery expensive.</p>
<p><strong>Medicaid Expansion Status:</strong> Oregon expanded Medicaid under the ACA. The Oregon Health Plan (OHP) covers approximately 1.4 million Oregonians statewide. Rural residents rely heavily on Medicaid, with <strong>26%+ of rural residents enrolled</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Medicaid Cut Exposure:</strong> Oregon faces <strong>estimated cuts of $600+ million in Medicaid funding over 10 years</strong> under H.R. 1 provisions. These cuts will disproportionately affect rural providers already operating at negative margins. The RHTP award of $197.3 million annually, while significant, covers only a portion of projected Medicaid losses.</p>

<p>Oregon&rsquo;s <strong>16 Coordinated Care Organizations</strong> already implement SDOH screening and referral under existing OHA contracts. RHTP investments enhance these capabilities for rural populations with limited CCO penetration.</p>
<p>The state&rsquo;s approach embeds SDOH within CCO-administered programs rather than creating parallel infrastructure. This model leverages existing relationships but creates implementation gaps in areas where CCO presence is weak.</p>
<h3 id="community-health-worker-programs">Community Health Worker Programs<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#community-health-worker-programs">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>CHW deployment receives dedicated funding</strong> through the Prevention and Chronic Disease initiative. Oregon&rsquo;s approach focuses on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rural CHW expansion through CCO partnerships</li>
<li>Training pipeline development via community colleges</li>
<li>Supervision integration within primary care practices</li>
<li>Cultural competency for tribal and agricultural worker populations</li>
</ul>
<p>The state&rsquo;s existing CHW certification program provides regulatory framework. WWAMI (Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana, Idaho) participation through OHSU connects CHW training to broader regional workforce development.</p>
<p><strong>CHW employer model:</strong> CCOs and FQHCs serve as primary employers with clinical supervision. No dedicated CHW intermediary proposed.</p>
<h3 id="technology-platform-status">Technology Platform Status<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#technology-platform-status">#</a></h3>
<p>Oregon has <strong>existing statewide CIE infrastructure through Connect Oregon</strong>, a coordinated care network powered by Unite Us. RHTP does not require major new platform procurement because most CCOs already participate in Connect Oregon.</p>
<p><strong>Connect Oregon (Unite Us):</strong> The majority of Oregon&rsquo;s 16 CCOs use Unite Us through Connect Oregon for closed-loop referrals and HRSN service coordination. Participating CCOs include Samaritan Health Services/IHN-CCO, PacificSource, CareOregon, Columbia Pacific CCO, Jackson Care Connect, Health Share of Oregon, AllCare Health, EOCCO, Yamhill Community Care, Advanced Health, Umpqua Health Alliance, and Trillium. The network has processed nearly <strong>$4 million in HRSN services</strong> through the platform as of mid-2025.</p>
<p><strong>Findhelp:</strong> A small number of CCOs use Findhelp as an alternative platform. OHA maintains Statewide Price Agreements with both Unite Us and Findhelp to accommodate CCO preferences.</p>
<p><strong>211info:</strong> Serves as the coordination center for Connect Oregon, providing resource directory maintenance and community engagement support.</p>
<p><strong>RHTP technology focus:</strong> Funds prioritize EHR optimization and health information exchange expansion rather than CIE platform procurement, given existing infrastructure.</p>

<h3 id="cco-centered-implementation">CCO-Centered Implementation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#cco-centered-implementation">#</a></h3>
<p>Oregon&rsquo;s 16 CCOs represent the primary implementation channel for population health and social care investments. CCOs have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Decade of experience with capitated Medicaid contracts</li>
<li>Established value-based payment infrastructure</li>
<li>Regional coordination experience</li>
<li>Existing SDOH screening requirements</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>CCO variation:</strong> Implementation capacity varies significantly across CCOs. Urban-adjacent CCOs have more resources than frontier-serving organizations. RHTP must address capacity gaps in weakest CCOs.</p>
<h3 id="academic-partnership">Academic Partnership<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#academic-partnership">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>OHSU</strong> provides multiple implementation functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Oregon Office of Rural Health technical assistance</li>
<li>Telehealth hub for specialty access</li>
<li>Rural residency track expansion</li>
<li>Research and evaluation capacity</li>
</ul>
<p>OHSU&rsquo;s rural affiliate relationships connect smaller facilities to academic resources while maintaining local operational control.</p>
<h2 id="assessment">Assessment<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#assessment">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="strengths">Strengths<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#strengths">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>CCO Infrastructure:</strong> Oregon&rsquo;s decade of investment in Coordinated Care Organizations provides implementation capacity that most states lack. The 16 CCOs have experience with population health, value-based payment, and regional coordination. RHTP investments can leverage this infrastructure rather than building new systems.</p>
<p><strong>OHSU Partnership:</strong> The Oregon Office of Rural Health brings established relationships with rural facilities, technical expertise in rural healthcare delivery, and research capacity to evaluate interventions. This academic-state partnership provides continuity regardless of political changes.</p>
<p><strong>Phased Deployment:</strong> The two-phase structure acknowledges that communities start from different positions. Catalyst Awards get resources to ready projects quickly while planning grants develop capacity for larger investments.</p>
<p><strong>Value-Based Foundation:</strong> With 80% of state health spending tied to quality expectations, Oregon providers have experience with performance accountability. RHTP&rsquo;s quality metrics align with existing CCO reporting requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Social Care Integration:</strong> Oregon&rsquo;s explicit CHW funding and CCO-administered SDOH programs represent stronger social care commitment than many state applications.</p>
<p><strong>Connect Oregon CIE Infrastructure:</strong> Most CCOs already participate in Connect Oregon, a statewide Unite Us network for closed-loop referrals. This existing infrastructure eliminates the CIE procurement challenge that other states face, allowing RHTP to focus on service delivery rather than platform buildout.</p>
<h3 id="vulnerabilities">Vulnerabilities<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#vulnerabilities">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Per-Capita Limitations:</strong> At ~$131 per rural resident, Oregon&rsquo;s funding falls short of what comprehensive transformation requires. The money must stretch across workforce, infrastructure, technology, and population health initiatives simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong>Geographic Dispersion:</strong> Frontier counties with six or fewer people per square mile present challenges that money cannot solve. Travel times, recruitment barriers, and service delivery costs in these areas exceed what traditional healthcare models accommodate.</p>
<p><strong>Hospital Financial Position:</strong> With one-third of rural hospitals at negative margins and $93 million in combined losses, the baseline requires stabilization before transformation. RHTP funds may flow to financial rescue rather than system redesign.</p>
<p><strong>Workforce Pipeline Duration:</strong> Training new physicians takes a decade. RHTP&rsquo;s five-year timeline cannot produce enough new providers to address current shortages. Retention and recruitment of existing providers becomes essential but uncertain.</p>
<p><strong>Rural CCO Capacity Variation:</strong> Implementation capacity varies significantly across CCOs. Urban-adjacent CCOs have more resources than frontier-serving organizations. RHTP must address capacity gaps in weakest CCOs to achieve statewide impact.</p>
<h3 id="social-care-survival-prospects">Social Care Survival Prospects<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#social-care-survival-prospects">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>SDOH Screening:</strong> Survives through existing CCO requirements and additional RHTP investment. Screening infrastructure likely to persist.</p>
<p><strong>HRSN Navigation:</strong> At risk. CCO-administered navigation competes with core medical services for attention and resources. Rural CCOs may deprioritize navigation under financial pressure.</p>
<p><strong>CHW Deployment:</strong> Likely survives. Dedicated funding stream and CCO employer model provide stability. Training pipeline remains vulnerable to budget triage.</p>
<p><strong>CIE Platform:</strong> Operational. Connect Oregon provides statewide closed-loop referral infrastructure through Unite Us. Most CCOs already participate. Platform has processed nearly $4 million in HRSN services as of mid-2025.</p>
<h3 id="the-2030-question">The 2030 Question<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-2030-question">#</a></h3>
<p>Oregon&rsquo;s sustainability strategy emphasizes:</p>
<p><strong>CCO Integration:</strong> Embedding RHTP-funded programs within CCO operations creates ongoing financial support through capitation rather than grant dependency.</p>
<p><strong>Value-Based Payment Expansion:</strong> Shifting more provider revenue to VBP arrangements reduces reliance on volume and creates incentives for efficiency and prevention.</p>
<p><strong>State Policy Commitments:</strong> Oregon&rsquo;s application includes policy commitments around workforce scope of practice, telehealth coverage, and rural facility support that extend beyond RHTP funding.</p>
<p><strong>The deeper question:</strong> Whether transformation proceeds fast enough. Oregon&rsquo;s rural health system requires simultaneous investment in workforce, facilities, technology, and population health. Five years of historic investment can improve trajectories without fundamentally altering the economic reality of healthcare delivery in frontier America.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>Oregon&rsquo;s $197.3 million RHTP award provides meaningful investment in a rural health system under significant stress. The state brings genuine advantages: a decade of CCO experience, established academic partnerships, and existing infrastructure for value-based care. The phased implementation approach reflects realistic assessment of community readiness.</p>
<p>The structural challenges remain formidable. One-third of rural hospitals operate at negative margins. Frontier counties face workforce and geography barriers that money alone cannot solve. Medicaid cuts will erode provider revenue while RHTP attempts to build new capacity.</p>
<p>Social care integration receives stronger commitment than many states, with dedicated CHW funding, CCO-administered SDOH programs, and existing CIE infrastructure through Connect Oregon. The Unite Us platform already processes HRSN referrals for most CCOs, providing closed-loop capability that many states lack.</p>
<p>For Oregon&rsquo;s 1.5 million rural residents, RHTP represents opportunity and uncertainty in equal measure. The state has a plan. The CCO infrastructure exists. <strong>Whether rural Oregonians experience better healthcare depends on variables that extend beyond state borders and federal program timelines.</strong></p>
