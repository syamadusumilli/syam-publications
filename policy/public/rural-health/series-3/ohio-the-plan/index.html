  "articleBody": "Part 1 established the baseline: $202 million in fiscal year 2026, average funding for a state with 4.4 million rural residents across 73 non-urban counties. Ohio’s award places it precisely at the national mean, neither crisis-level funding nor minimum allocation. The arithmetic produced $46 per rural resident annually, less than the cost of a single primary care visit. Against this funding reality, Ohio faces 33 Critical Access Hospitals operating on margins of 2% or less, 13 maternity care deserts, primary care availability at half urban levels, and 32 Appalachian counties where life expectancy runs ten years shorter than statewide averages.\nPart 2 examines what Ohio proposes to do with that funding.\nThe answer reveals a state betting on incremental improvement over structural transformation. Five initiatives organize the approach: Rural Patient Health Innovation Hubs establishing regional coordination, Emergency Care Transformation scaling treat-in-place protocols, School-Based Health Centers bringing care to where children already congregate, the OH SEE Program expanding mobile vision and hearing services, and the Rural Workforce Pipeline building a continuum from high school through professional employment. Cross-cutting strategies embed telehealth, remote monitoring, and interoperable electronic health records across all initiatives.\nThe Ohio Department of Health serves as lead agency and prime awardee, coordinating implementation across multiple offices with distinct responsibilities. The strategy emphasizes proven models over untested innovations, existing infrastructure over new construction, and visible wins over ambitious experiments.\nThis is not a plan designed to fail. It is also not a plan designed to transform. Ohio’s bet is simpler: that making what already exists work better is more achievable than reimagining rural healthcare from scratch. Whether that bet proves sufficient depends on implementation details that remain unclear and political will that remains untested.\nThe Strategic Framework Governance Structure and Lead Agency The Ohio Department of Health (ODH) serves as the state’s designated lead agency for RHTP implementation, holding the cooperative agreement with CMS (Award Number RHTCMS332087). Within ODH, multiple offices share responsibility for distinct initiative areas:\nThe Primary Care Office administers workforce development programs including loan repayment, J-1 visa waivers, and the National Health Service Corps coordination. This office takes lead responsibility for the Rural Workforce Pipeline initiative, building on existing program infrastructure and stakeholder relationships with medical schools and training institutions.\nThe Bureau of Maternal, Child and Family Health manages school-based health center expansion, leveraging existing relationships with school districts and pediatric care networks. The bureau’s experience with the OH SEE vision program positions it to lead that initiative’s statewide scaling.\nThe State Office of Rural Health coordinates rural health initiatives statewide, serving as the natural convener for Rural Patient Health Innovation Hub development. This office collects rural health information, coordinates resources, provides technical assistance, and supports recruitment and retention efforts.\nOhio Emergency Medical Services oversees the Emergency Care Transformation initiative, building on existing regulatory authority over EMS certification, training, and protocol development.\nThis division of labor could facilitate implementation, with each office handling initiatives within their expertise. Or it could create coordination challenges, with multiple offices competing for limited budget and unclear accountability for cross-cutting goals.\nTheory of Change Ohio’s application articulates a theory of change rooted in systems integration rather than systems replacement. The premise: rural healthcare fails not because individual components are broken but because they operate in isolation. Hospitals, FQHCs, EMS, pharmacies, behavioral health agencies, and community organizations each deliver services without coordination. Patients fall through cracks during transitions. High-need patients navigate multiple disconnected providers. Care gets duplicated or neglected.\nThe transformation strategy therefore emphasizes connection over construction. Rather than building new facilities, Ohio links existing ones. Rather than creating new service lines, Ohio coordinates existing capacity. Rather than recruiting thousands of new providers, Ohio retains the ones already practicing and connects them to support networks.\nThis approach has the virtue of achievability within five years and $202 million. It also has the limitation of accepting existing capacity as sufficient when evidence suggests otherwise.\nCore Initiatives and Interrelationships Ohio’s five initiatives and cross-cutting strategies form an interconnected system, at least on paper:\nThe Rural Workforce Pipeline ensures providers to staff school-based health centers and innovation hubs. Medical students train in school-based centers and hub care teams, creating rural practice exposure that increases retention probability.\nSchool-Based Health Centers bring care to rural children while serving as training sites for workforce development. Complex cases escalate to innovation hubs for coordinated specialty care.\nRural Patient Health Innovation Hubs anchor regional coordination, connecting hospitals, FQHCs, EMS, and community partners. Hubs recruit workforce through pipeline programs and provide backup support to school-based centers.\nEmergency Care Transformation integrates with hub networks, allowing EMS to triage patients to appropriate care settings rather than defaulting to distant emergency departments.\nOH SEE Program delivers mobile services that complement fixed school-based health centers, reaching students in districts without center capacity.\nCross-cutting technology strategies enable these connections through telehealth, shared electronic records, and remote monitoring.\nWhether these interconnections function as designed depends on coordination mechanisms that remain underdeveloped and stakeholder willingness to collaborate rather than compete.\nProgram Allocation Table Program Name Focus Area FY2026 Allocation Lead Organization Key Deliverables Rural Patient Health Innovation Hubs Access/Integration $50-60 million (5-year) ODH State Office of Rural Health 5-7 regional hubs anchored by CAHs or FQHCs; care coordination networks; telehealth connectivity Emergency Care Transformation Emergency Access $25-35 million (5-year) Ohio EMS Treat-in-place protocols statewide; EMS training expansion; dispatch system upgrades School-Based Health Centers Access/Prevention $50-60 million (5-year) ODH Bureau of MCH New centers in rural K-12 and college campuses; primary, behavioral, dental services OH SEE Program Prevention/Children $15-20 million (5-year) ODH Bureau of MCH Statewide mobile vision, hearing, dental screening; treatment referral pathways Rural Workforce Pipeline Workforce $60-70 million (5-year) ODH Primary Care Office Enhanced loan repayment; medical school rural tracks; CHW upskilling; 5-year service commitments Cross-Cutting Technology Infrastructure $15-25 million (5-year) ODH (multi-office) Telehealth deployment; EHR interoperability; remote monitoring equipment Administration and Oversight Program Management $15-20 million (5-year) ODH CMS reporting; stakeholder coordination; performance monitoring Note: Allocation figures are estimates based on application narrative and comparable state distributions. Official initiative-level budgets pending CMS finalization of cooperative agreement terms.\nRural Patient Health Innovation Hubs Design and Mechanics The Rural Patient Health Innovation Hubs represent Ohio’s most ambitious initiative, attempting to solve healthcare fragmentation through regional coordination structures. An estimated 25-30% of RHTP funding ($50-60 million over five years) supports establishing 5-7 geographic hubs across Ohio’s rural regions.\nEach hub anchors around a Critical Access Hospital or large FQHC with strong operational capacity, adequate electronic health record infrastructure, and willingness to serve a coordinating role. Spoke sites connect to the hub, including smaller Critical Access Hospitals, Rural Health Clinics, FQHC satellite sites, and potentially private primary care practices willing to participate.\nRegional hub structure divides rural Ohio into 5-7 geographic regions. Selection criteria for hub anchors likely include existing infrastructure capacity, geographic centrality within region, EHR capabilities, and relationships with regional providers. Each hub coordinates care for a defined population of 100,000-300,000 people depending on regional geography and density.\nThe hub does not deliver all care. It coordinates care delivered across the network, manages care transitions, tracks high-need patients, and facilitates specialty access through telehealth connections to academic medical centers.\nTarget Population and Geography Hub development prioritizes Appalachian Ohio’s 32 counties where health disparities concentrate most severely. The southeastern quadrant of the state, stretching from the northeastern corner to the southern border, encompasses communities with the highest poverty rates, worst health outcomes, and most severe provider shortages.\nSecondary priority extends to northwestern agricultural counties where aging farm populations face access challenges, and exurban growth counties around Columbus where population expansion strains infrastructure designed for smaller populations.\nGeographic diversity creates implementation complexity. What works in densely populated Athens County may fail in sparsely populated Meigs County. Hub models must accommodate variation or produce uneven results.\nImplementation Timeline Hub development follows a phased approach:\n2026-2027: Identify and contract with 2-3 pilot hub anchors; establish governance structures; deploy initial technology infrastructure; recruit care coordination staff.\n2027-2028: Expand to full 5-7 hub network; integrate spoke sites; launch care coordination services; establish telehealth connections.\n2028-2030: Scale population health management; integrate behavioral health and social services; demonstrate outcomes; plan for sustainability.\nThe two-year spending requirement demands aggressive timeline execution, with FY2026 funds obligated by September 30, 2027. This creates pressure to select partners and launch activities before comprehensive planning completes.\nSubawardees Under This Initiative Organization Type Estimated Value Role Adena Health System Provider Hub $8-12 million Southeastern Ohio regional hub anchor; specialty telehealth origination OhioHealth (rural facilities) Provider Hub $6-10 million Central/western Ohio hub anchor; care coordination infrastructure Genesis Health System Provider Network $5-8 million Southeastern Ohio spoke integration; behavioral health coordination Holzer Health System Provider Network $4-6 million Southern Ohio spoke site; maternal care coordination Select CAHs (TBD) Spoke Sites $10-15 million total Local care delivery; data sharing; protocol compliance Ohio University (ORUP) Academic Partner $3-5 million Training, evaluation, technical assistance Note: Specific subawardee selections pending ODH procurement processes. Organizations listed represent likely partners based on application narrative and geographic positioning.\nEmergency Care Transformation Design and Mechanics Ohio’s Emergency Care Transformation initiative scales a successful pilot enabling EMS to provide treat-in-place or alternate-destination care, reducing unnecessary emergency department use through advanced training, system upgrades, and improved connectivity.\nThe initiative builds on existing community paramedicine protocols that allow trained paramedics to assess patients in the field and determine appropriate care pathways. Rather than transporting all patients to distant emergency departments by default, trained EMS teams can treat minor conditions on scene, transport to urgent care facilities, or connect patients with telehealth consultations.\nTarget investment of $25-35 million over five years supports protocol development, EMS training expansion, dispatch system upgrades enabling destination selection, and connectivity infrastructure linking field units to receiving facilities.\nTarget Population and Geography Rural Ohioans face average transport times exceeding 30 minutes to emergency departments in many counties. For time-sensitive conditions, this delay proves fatal. For non-emergent conditions, it consumes resources and creates unnecessary ED crowding.\nEmergency Care Transformation targets both scenarios. Time-sensitive cases benefit from improved protocol coordination and destination optimization. Non-emergent cases receive appropriate care without resource-intensive ED visits.\nGeographic prioritization focuses on counties with the longest transport times, highest rates of unnecessary ED utilization, and EMS agencies with capacity for advanced training.\nPerformance Metrics Ohio’s application commits to measurable outcomes:\nReduction in unnecessary ED transports by 15-25% in participating service areas Improved response times through optimized dispatch and destination protocols Patient satisfaction scores demonstrating acceptance of treat-in-place alternatives Cost savings from avoided ED visits and reduced transport distances Implementation Dependencies Emergency Care Transformation success depends on factors partially outside RHTP control:\nMedical direction must approve expanded protocols. Physician oversight requirements vary by county medical director philosophy.\nHospital cooperation enables alternate destinations. Facilities must accept patients from EMS diversion and integrate them into appropriate care pathways.\nReimbursement structures must support treat-in-place activities. Current payment models reimburse transport but not on-scene treatment, creating financial disincentives for the behavior RHTP encourages.\nWorkforce availability constrains expansion. EMS agencies already face staffing shortages. Advanced training requirements further strain limited personnel.\nSchool-Based Health Centers Design and Mechanics School-based health centers represent Ohio’s most visible initiative, targeting rural school districts without existing centers. An estimated 25-30% of RHTP funding ($50-60 million over five years) supports establishing clinics on K-12 and college campuses offering primary, behavioral, dental, and telehealth services.\nThe rationale is straightforward. Rural families struggle with transportation to distant clinics. Parents working multiple jobs cannot take time off for children’s appointments. Preventive care gets deferred. Chronic conditions go unmanaged. Behavioral health needs go untreated. Schools solve the logistics problem: children already attend, school nurses identify health needs, school facilities provide space.\nServices provided include primary care (acute illness, chronic disease management, physicals, immunizations), behavioral health counseling, dental services where feasible, and connections to specialty care through telehealth or referral. Centers operate during school hours and ideally extend to after-school hours to accommodate working parents.\nTarget Population and Geography Selection criteria for new school-based health centers likely include:\nHigh poverty rates and Medicaid enrollment Distance from existing primary care facilities Lack of alternative pediatric services in the community School district willingness to partner and provide space Facility availability meeting clinical requirements Priority goes to Appalachian counties and deeply rural districts where access problems are most severe. Urban-adjacent rural districts may rank lower despite similar demographic characteristics because urban alternatives exist within reasonable driving distance.\nPerformance Metrics School-based health center success metrics include:\nNumber of centers established and operational by 2030 Students served through annual encounters Conditions managed including chronic disease, behavioral health, dental Immunization rates among enrolled students School attendance changes associated with health center access Referral completion rates for specialty services Sustainability Pathway The critical question: what happens when RHTP ends in 2030?\nSchool-based health centers can potentially sustain through Medicaid billing for eligible services, but reimbursement rarely covers full operational costs. Many successful centers blend Medicaid, grants, and school district contributions. If RHTP funding ends and school districts cannot continue support, centers close.\nOhio’s sustainability strategy remains underdeveloped in public application materials. The implicit assumption: centers demonstrating value become embedded in school operations and generate political support for continued funding.\nOH SEE Program Expansion Design and Mechanics The OH SEE (Ohio Schools Eye Exams) program builds on a successful 13-county pilot, expanding statewide mobile vision, hearing, and dental care to ensure early diagnosis and treatment for children.\nAn estimated $15-20 million over five years supports mobile units, screening equipment, trained personnel, and referral coordination. The program provides vision screening in schools and eyeglasses for students who need them, addressing a common but often overlooked barrier to learning.\nVision problems affect educational achievement when children cannot see boards, read textbooks, or participate fully in classroom activities. Parents facing economic pressure defer vision care. OH SEE eliminates barriers by bringing screening to schools and covering treatment costs.\nTarget Population and Geography OH SEE expansion targets rural K-12 students across all 73 non-urban counties, with priority for:\nCounties lacking pediatric vision providers Districts with high Medicaid enrollment indicating economic barriers to care Schools documenting high rates of academic difficulty potentially linked to undiagnosed vision or hearing problems Integration with School-Based Health Centers OH SEE operates as a mobile complement to fixed school-based health centers. Districts with established centers can integrate screening services into center operations. Districts without centers rely on periodic mobile visits.\nThis tiered approach ensures some level of service reaches all rural students while concentrating infrastructure investment in highest-need areas.\nRural Workforce Pipeline Design and Mechanics Workforce shortage is the root cause that ripples through every other access problem. Ohio cannot staff expanded school-based health centers without providers. It cannot operate innovation hub care teams without care coordinators. It cannot deliver telehealth without clinicians on the other end of connections.\nOhio allocates an estimated 30-35% of total RHTP funding ($60-70 million over five years) to workforce development through four components:\nMedical school partnerships expand rural training tracks at Ohio’s three medical schools. Students who train in rural settings are more likely to practice rurally after residency. RHTP funding expands rural rotation placements, funds preceptorships at Critical Access Hospitals and FQHCs, and creates dedicated rural tracks with longitudinal experience.\nEnhanced loan repayment expands the existing Ohio Physician Loan Repayment Program and creates new loan repayment for nurses, physician assistants, behavioral health providers, and dentists. Awards require five-year rural service commitments as specified in RHTP statutory requirements.\nAdvanced practice provider training focuses on nurse practitioners and physician assistants who can provide primary care services meeting most rural health needs. The initiative expands NP and PA training programs with rural-focused curriculum and establishes clinical training sites in CAHs and RHCs.\nPipeline development targets high school and college students from rural communities through health career awareness programs, scholarship programs, and mentorship connecting rural students to healthcare professionals.\nImplementation Partners Organization Type Role in Workforce Initiative The Ohio State University Medical School Expanded rural rotations; Rural Health Scholars program Northeast Ohio Medical University Medical School Rural training track development; residency partnerships Ohio University Heritage College Medical School ORUP program expansion; Appalachian focus Ohio Association of Community Health Centers Primary Care Association FQHC training site coordination; CHW workforce development Ohio Hospital Association Intermediary CAH training site coordination; recruitment network University of Toledo AHEC Academic Partner Regional training coordination; preceptor development Performance Metrics Providers recruited to rural practice through loan repayment Retention rates at two, three, and five years post-placement Medical students completing rural rotations annually CHWs trained and deployed through workforce programs Geographic distribution demonstrating placement in highest-shortage areas Timeline Limitations Workforce pipeline investments face fundamental timeline constraints. A medical student entering school in 2026 graduates in 2030, completes residency by 2033-2035, then begins rural practice. RHTP funding ends before medical school pipeline investments produce practicing physicians.\nLoan repayment produces faster results because it recruits existing providers rather than training new ones. The tradeoff: loan repayment retains providers on a treadmill, requiring continuous investment rather than building self-sustaining capacity.\nSocial Care Integration SDOH/HRSN Initiatives Ohio’s RHTP application acknowledges social determinants of health as contributing factors to rural health disparities. The application references “addressing root causes of disease” among RHTP’s broad goals but provides limited specificity on systematic social care intervention.\nSDOH screening appears embedded within school-based health center and innovation hub initiatives rather than as a standalone program. Centers and hubs would screen patients for social needs including food insecurity, housing instability, transportation barriers, and economic distress.\nHRSN navigation receives implicit rather than explicit treatment. Care coordinators within innovation hubs would theoretically connect patients to community resources addressing identified needs. The application does not describe systematic navigation protocols, staffing models, or performance expectations for social need resolution.\nOhio’s existing Pathways Community HUB model provides potential infrastructure for social care integration. The model operates through certified HUBs employing community health workers who coordinate care and connect high-risk individuals to services. Integration with RHTP initiatives would leverage existing infrastructure rather than creating parallel systems.\nCommunity Health Worker Programs Ohio’s application includes CHW deployment within the workforce pipeline initiative rather than as a distinct social care program. The application references “upskilling for community health workers” and integration of CHWs into care teams at innovation hubs and school-based centers.\nThe Community Health Worker Center of Excellence, established through 2023 legislative action with $2.5 million annual funding, provides coordination infrastructure for CHW workforce development. The Center supports training programs, continuing education, and workforce assessment.\nOhio Medicaid offers two voluntary alternative payment models (Comprehensive Primary Care and Comprehensive Maternal Care) that provide enrolled practices with funding to support population health activities including CHW services. RHTP could expand these models to rural areas or create additional CHW positions outside Medicaid frameworks.\nProposed CHW deployment: Approximately 50-100 CHW positions embedded within innovation hubs and school-based health centers over five years, focusing on high-risk patient navigation and social need coordination.\nCommunity Information Exchange and Referral Platforms Ohio’s application does not specify a closed-loop referral platform requirement or name a CIE vendor for SDOH coordination. This represents a notable gap compared to states with explicit CIE procurement plans.\nExisting infrastructure includes:\nOhio 211 operated by United Way providing basic referral services Pathways Community HUB model using care coordination protocols Various hospital and health system referral platforms operating independently Procurement status: No active RFP for statewide CIE platform identified in Ohio procurement portals as of January 2026. Integration would likely occur through hub-level decisions rather than statewide mandate.\nTechnology Vendor Landscape Ohio’s SDOH technology landscape remains fragmented:\nUnite Us operates in select Ohio markets but lacks statewide deployment Findhelp (formerly Aunt Bertha) provides resource directory services Hospital system proprietary platforms at major health systems Pathways HUB software at certified community HUBs\nRHTP does not mandate vendor consolidation or statewide platform adoption. Individual hubs and health centers would likely make independent technology decisions, perpetuating fragmentation.\nSocial Care Integration Summary Table Component Requested Estimated Allocation Vendor/Operator Status SDOH Screening Yes (embedded) Included in hub/SBHC budgets Various EHR vendors Funded HRSN Navigation Implicit Included in care coordination Hub-level decisions At Risk CHW Deployment Yes (workforce) $5-10 million (5-year) Pathways HUBs; FQHCs Funded CIE Platform Not specified Not allocated None mandated At Risk Resource Directory Existing Not additional Ohio 211; Findhelp Existing Subawardee Registry Organization Type Estimated Contract Value Role in RHTP Implementation Ohio Hospital Association Intermediary $8-12 million Technical assistance; network coordination; CAH support Ohio Association of Community Health Centers Primary Care Association $6-10 million FQHC coordination; workforce pipeline; training sites Ohio State University Academic Partner $5-8 million Medical education expansion; telehealth hub; evaluation Ohio University Academic Partner $5-8 million ORUP expansion; Appalachian focus; community engagement Northeast Ohio Medical University Academic Partner $3-5 million Rural training track; residency partnerships Adena Health System Provider Hub $8-12 million Regional hub anchor; specialty telehealth; care coordination OhioHealth (rural facilities) Provider Network $6-10 million Hub development; infrastructure support Genesis Health System Provider Network $5-8 million Spoke integration; behavioral health coordination Pathways Community HUBs Community Partner $3-5 million CHW coordination; social care integration Various EMS agencies Service Providers $15-20 million total Protocol implementation; training; equipment Rural school districts (multiple) Facilities $10-15 million total SBHC space; partnership; student access Note: Subawardee selections and contract values pending ODH procurement processes. Figures represent estimates based on comparable state programs and application narrative.\nFunding Flow Documentation How Money Moves RHTP funding flows from CMS to Ohio through a cooperative agreement structure that provides more federal oversight than a block grant but more state flexibility than a contract.\nCMS to ODH: The full $202 million FY2026 award transfers to the Ohio Department of Health, which holds fiduciary responsibility and reporting obligations.\nODH administrative retention: An estimated 8-10% ($15-20 million over five years) supports ODH administration, CMS reporting compliance, stakeholder coordination, and performance monitoring.\nODH to initiative offices: Remaining funds distribute to the Primary Care Office, Bureau of Maternal Child and Family Health, State Office of Rural Health, and EMS based on initiative allocations.\nInitiative offices to subawardees: Each office administers contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements with implementing organizations. Some allocation is competitive (partners apply for specific projects). Some is formula-based (geographic distribution, facility type, service area characteristics).\nIntermediary Pass-Through Arrangements The Ohio Hospital Association serves as a key intermediary for CAH-related activities, receiving RHTP funds for distribution to member facilities along with technical assistance and coordination services.\nThe Ohio Association of Community Health Centers (Primary Care Association) similarly intermediates FQHC participation, coordinating workforce development, training sites, and care delivery expansion across the community health center network.\nThese intermediary arrangements create efficiency through existing relationships but add administrative layers between federal funding and direct service delivery.\nTimeline for Fund Distribution The two-year spending requirement creates aggressive distribution timelines:\nQ1 2026: Award finalization; cooperative agreement execution; ODH budget allocation Q2-Q3 2026: Subaward procurement; partner contracting; initiative launch Q4 2026 - Q3 2027: Service delivery ramp-up; spending acceleration By September 30, 2027: All FY2026 funds obligated\nThis timeline forces rapid decision-making that may sacrifice planning quality for spending compliance.\nCross-Initiative Coordination How Initiatives Connect Ohio’s five initiatives and cross-cutting strategies theoretically interconnect into a coherent system:\nWorkforce enables everything. Without providers, neither school-based health centers nor innovation hubs can operate. Workforce pipeline investments must precede or parallel service expansion.\nHubs coordinate complexity. When school-based health centers encounter cases beyond their capacity, hub networks provide referral pathways and specialty access through telehealth.\nEMS integrates with hubs. Emergency Care Transformation protocols connect to hub coordination, allowing field triage decisions informed by hub capacity and appropriate destination selection.\nTechnology enables connections. Interoperable electronic health records, telehealth platforms, and shared patient tracking systems make coordination possible across organizational boundaries.\nSequencing and Dependencies Effective implementation requires sequencing that RHTP timelines may not permit:\nTechnology infrastructure must precede care coordination (cannot coordinate without connected systems) Workforce recruitment must precede service expansion (cannot deliver without providers) Hub anchor selection must precede spoke integration (cannot coordinate without coordinators) Training must precede protocol deployment (cannot implement without prepared personnel) The two-year spending requirement pressures parallel rather than sequential implementation, risking misalignment between infrastructure and services.\nIntegration Challenges Competing organizational interests may undermine coordination goals. Hospitals and FQHCs often compete for patients. Getting competitors to collaborate requires either strong financial incentives or recognition that coordination serves everyone’s interest. RHTP provides neither sustained financial incentives beyond five years nor guarantees that collaboration outweighs competition.\nMultiple ODH offices with distinct initiatives may produce parallel streams rather than integrated programs. Without a single empowered integrator enforcing alignment, initiatives proceed independently. The result: visible progress on multiple fronts, insufficient system-level change.\nBudget Flow and Timeline Allocation Across Initiatives Initiative FY2026 Estimate Five-Year Projection Percentage Workforce Pipeline $12-14 million $60-70 million 30-35% School-Based Health Centers $10-12 million $50-60 million 25-30% Innovation Hubs $10-12 million $50-60 million 25-30% Emergency Care Transformation $5-7 million $25-35 million 12-17% OH SEE Program $3-4 million $15-20 million 8-10% Cross-Cutting Technology $3-5 million $15-25 million 8-12% Administration $3-4 million $15-20 million 8-10% Note: Percentages exceed 100% due to overlapping cross-cutting investments.\nTwo-Year Obligation Requirement Ohio must obligate FY2026 funds ($202 million) by September 30, 2027. This creates a 21-month window to structure subawards, select partners, launch initiatives, and demonstrate progress.\nThe requirement forces action and overcomes bureaucratic inertia. It also risks hasty implementation and insufficient planning.\nFront-loading spending in 2026-2027 means workforce loan repayment awards, school-based health center construction, and hub contracting must occur within the first year. Aggressive timelines favor ready partners over optimal partners.\nWhat the Plan Assumes Explicit Assumptions Ohio’s application explicitly assumes:\nExisting infrastructure can be leveraged rather than built anew Provider recruitment responds to enhanced loan repayment incentives School districts will partner for school-based health centers Regional coordination produces value that motivates participant collaboration Technology deployment overcomes fragmentation barriers Implicit Assumptions The plan implicitly assumes:\nPolitical stability maintains Medicaid expansion and RHTP support through 2030 CMS continues funding at projected levels without major adjustments Rural communities accept transformed care models Stakeholders collaborate despite competitive market dynamics Social care components can function without dedicated CIE infrastructure Risks Acknowledged vs. Ignored Acknowledged risks: Provider recruitment difficulty; implementation timeline pressure; geographic variation; sustainability post-2030.\nIgnored risks: Medicaid cuts eliminating coverage gains; hub coordination failures; technology interoperability barriers; social care defunding under resource constraints; political shifts reducing state commitment.\nConclusion Ohio’s RHTP plan is comprehensive, conventional, and cautious. The five initiatives and cross-cutting strategies represent proven approaches that work in rural health contexts elsewhere. Ohio is not experimenting. It is scaling what exists.\nThe strategy emphasizes leveraging existing infrastructure over building anew, proven models over untested innovations, and visible wins over structural transformation. This approach has the virtue of achievability within five years and $202 million. It also has the limitation of accepting existing capacity as sufficient when evidence suggests otherwise.\nSocial care integration survives as documentation, not delivery. Ohio will screen for social needs. Whether those needs get addressed depends on community resources existing independently of RHTP, not on systematic intervention funded by transformation dollars.\nThe interconnected system exists on paper. Whether workforce, hubs, school-based centers, EMS transformation, and technology actually function as an integrated system depends on coordination mechanisms that remain underdeveloped and stakeholder willingness to prioritize collaboration over competition.\nPart 3 will assess whether the plan can work, what survives when constraints bite, and what Ohio’s choices reveal about stated versus actual priorities. The question is not whether $202 million produces visible progress. It will. The question is whether visible progress constitutes transformation or merely activity dressed in transformation rhetoric.\nCross-References Series 1: Understanding Rural America\n1A: Geography and Definition (rural classification systems) 1B: Demographics (aging populations, workforce out-migration) 1D: Economics and Employment (Rust Belt decline) 1E: Healthcare Access (provider shortage patterns) 1G: Social Fabric and Isolation (Appalachian cultural context) Series 2: Federal Policy Architecture\n2A: RHTP Structure and Rules (statutory framework, formula mechanics) 2B: Medicaid Architecture and the $911 Billion Question (expansion state context) 2D: HRSA Rural Programs (workforce program coordination) 2H: The 2030 Cliff (sustainability requirements, funding expiration) Series 3: State Implementation\n3.OH.1: Ohio, The Problem (Part 1 baseline analysis) 3.OH.3: Ohio, The Analysis (Part 3 critical assessment) 3.TX: Texas (large rural population comparison) 3.KY: Kentucky (Appalachian concentration comparison) 3.WV: West Virginia (Appalachian core) Series 4: Transformation Approaches\n4B: Workforce Development (pipeline strategies) 4D: Community Health Workers (CHW deployment models) 4E: Hub-and-Spoke Networks (regional coordination) 4H: Social Needs Integration (SDOH/CIE approaches) Series 10: Regional Deep Dives\n10E: Southeast Ohio (Appalachian county analysis) Sources Appalachian Institute to Advance Health Equity Science. “ADVANCE: Addressing Health Disparities through Community Collaboration.” Ohio University, 2025, www.ohio.edu/chsp/advance.\nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services. “CMS Announces $50 Billion in Awards to Strengthen Rural Health in All 50 States.” CMS Newsroom, 29 Dec. 2025, www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-announces-50-billion-awards-strengthen-rural-health-all-50-states.\nDeWine, Mike. “Governor DeWine Announces Ohio’s Rural Health Transformation Program Award.” Office of the Governor, 30 Dec. 2025.\nHall Render. “CMS Announces $50 Billion Rural Health Transformation Program Awards to All 50 States.” Hall Render Health Law Insights, 6 Jan. 2026, hallrender.com/2026/01/06/cms-announces-50-billion-rural-health-transformation-program-awards-to-all-50-states/.\nHealth Management Associates. “CMS Announces Rural Health Transformation Program Awardees.” HMA Insights, Jan. 2026, www.healthmanagement.com/blog/cms-announces-rural-health-transformation-program-awardees/.\nNational Academy for State Health Policy. “State Community Health Worker Policies: Ohio.” NASHP State Tracker, 10 Apr. 2025, nashp.org/state-tracker/state-community-health-worker-policies/ohio/.\nOhio Association of Community Health Centers. “About OACHC.” OACHC, 2025, www.ohiochc.org/about.\nOhio Department of Health. “Ohio Rural Health Transformation Program Application.” HHS TAGGS, Dec. 2025, taggs.hhs.gov/Detail/AwardDetail?arg_AwardNum=RHTCMS332087\u0026arg_ProgOfficeCode=190.\nOhio Rural Health Association. “Ohio Rural Health Improvement Plan.” ORHA, 2021, www.ohioruralhealth.org/ohio-rural-health-improvement-plan.\nOhio University Office of Rural and Underserved Programs. “Preparing Learners for Underserved Communities.” Heritage College of Osteopathic Medicine, 2025, www.ohio.edu/medicine/about/offices/rural-underserved-programs.\nRural Health Information Hub. “Ohio Organizations.” RHIhub, 2025, www.ruralhealthinfo.org/states/ohio/organizations.\nShumaker, Loop \u0026 Kendrick, LLP. “Client Alert: Ohio Receives $202 Million for Rural Health Transformation.” Shumaker, Jan. 2026, www.shumaker.com/insight/client-alert-ohio-receives-202-million-for-rural-health-transformation-what-health-care-providers-should-know/.\nU.S. Senate Committee on Finance. “Rural Health Transformation Program Fact Sheet.” Senate Finance, Aug. 2025, www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/rural_health_transformation_program_fact_sheet.pdf.\nThis is Part 2 of the priority state analysis for Ohio.

</div>

<p>Part 1 established the baseline: <strong>$202 million in fiscal year 2026</strong>, average funding for a state with 4.4 million rural residents across 73 non-urban counties. Ohio&rsquo;s award places it precisely at the national mean, neither crisis-level funding nor minimum allocation. The arithmetic produced <strong>$46 per rural resident annually</strong>, less than the cost of a single primary care visit. Against this funding reality, Ohio faces 33 Critical Access Hospitals operating on margins of 2% or less, 13 maternity care deserts, primary care availability at half urban levels, and 32 Appalachian counties where life expectancy runs ten years shorter than statewide averages.</p>
<p>Part 2 examines what Ohio proposes to do with that funding.</p>
<p>The answer reveals a state betting on <strong>incremental improvement over structural transformation</strong>. Five initiatives organize the approach: Rural Patient Health Innovation Hubs establishing regional coordination, Emergency Care Transformation scaling treat-in-place protocols, School-Based Health Centers bringing care to where children already congregate, the OH SEE Program expanding mobile vision and hearing services, and the Rural Workforce Pipeline building a continuum from high school through professional employment. Cross-cutting strategies embed telehealth, remote monitoring, and interoperable electronic health records across all initiatives.</p>
<p>The <strong>Ohio Department of Health</strong> serves as lead agency and prime awardee, coordinating implementation across multiple offices with distinct responsibilities. The strategy emphasizes proven models over untested innovations, existing infrastructure over new construction, and visible wins over ambitious experiments.</p>
<p>This is not a plan designed to fail. It is also not a plan designed to transform. Ohio&rsquo;s bet is simpler: that making what already exists work better is more achievable than reimagining rural healthcare from scratch. Whether that bet proves sufficient depends on implementation details that remain unclear and political will that remains untested.</p>
<h2 id="the-strategic-framework">The Strategic Framework<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-strategic-framework">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="governance-structure-and-lead-agency">Governance Structure and Lead Agency<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#governance-structure-and-lead-agency">#</a></h3>
<p>The <strong>Ohio Department of Health (ODH)</strong> serves as the state&rsquo;s designated lead agency for RHTP implementation, holding the cooperative agreement with CMS (Award Number RHTCMS332087). Within ODH, multiple offices share responsibility for distinct initiative areas:</p>
<p><strong>The Primary Care Office</strong> administers workforce development programs including loan repayment, J-1 visa waivers, and the National Health Service Corps coordination. This office takes lead responsibility for the Rural Workforce Pipeline initiative, building on existing program infrastructure and stakeholder relationships with medical schools and training institutions.</p>
<p><strong>The Bureau of Maternal, Child and Family Health</strong> manages school-based health center expansion, leveraging existing relationships with school districts and pediatric care networks. The bureau&rsquo;s experience with the OH SEE vision program positions it to lead that initiative&rsquo;s statewide scaling.</p>
<p><strong>The State Office of Rural Health</strong> coordinates rural health initiatives statewide, serving as the natural convener for Rural Patient Health Innovation Hub development. This office collects rural health information, coordinates resources, provides technical assistance, and supports recruitment and retention efforts.</p>
<p><strong>Ohio Emergency Medical Services</strong> oversees the Emergency Care Transformation initiative, building on existing regulatory authority over EMS certification, training, and protocol development.</p>
<p>This division of labor could facilitate implementation, with each office handling initiatives within their expertise. Or it could create coordination challenges, with multiple offices competing for limited budget and unclear accountability for cross-cutting goals.</p>
<h3 id="theory-of-change">Theory of Change<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#theory-of-change">#</a></h3>
<p>Ohio&rsquo;s application articulates a theory of change rooted in <strong>systems integration rather than systems replacement</strong>. The premise: rural healthcare fails not because individual components are broken but because they operate in isolation. Hospitals, FQHCs, EMS, pharmacies, behavioral health agencies, and community organizations each deliver services without coordination. Patients fall through cracks during transitions. High-need patients navigate multiple disconnected providers. Care gets duplicated or neglected.</p>
<p>The transformation strategy therefore emphasizes <strong>connection over construction</strong>. Rather than building new facilities, Ohio links existing ones. Rather than creating new service lines, Ohio coordinates existing capacity. Rather than recruiting thousands of new providers, Ohio retains the ones already practicing and connects them to support networks.</p>
<p>This approach has the virtue of achievability within five years and $202 million. It also has the limitation of accepting existing capacity as sufficient when evidence suggests otherwise.</p>
<h3 id="core-initiatives-and-interrelationships">Core Initiatives and Interrelationships<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#core-initiatives-and-interrelationships">#</a></h3>
<p>Ohio&rsquo;s five initiatives and cross-cutting strategies form an interconnected system, at least on paper:</p>
<p><strong>The Rural Workforce Pipeline</strong> ensures providers to staff school-based health centers and innovation hubs. Medical students train in school-based centers and hub care teams, creating rural practice exposure that increases retention probability.</p>
<p><strong>School-Based Health Centers</strong> bring care to rural children while serving as training sites for workforce development. Complex cases escalate to innovation hubs for coordinated specialty care.</p>
<p><strong>Rural Patient Health Innovation Hubs</strong> anchor regional coordination, connecting hospitals, FQHCs, EMS, and community partners. Hubs recruit workforce through pipeline programs and provide backup support to school-based centers.</p>
<p><strong>Emergency Care Transformation</strong> integrates with hub networks, allowing EMS to triage patients to appropriate care settings rather than defaulting to distant emergency departments.</p>
<p><strong>OH SEE Program</strong> delivers mobile services that complement fixed school-based health centers, reaching students in districts without center capacity.</p>
<p><strong>Cross-cutting technology strategies</strong> enable these connections through telehealth, shared electronic records, and remote monitoring.</p>
<p>Whether these interconnections function as designed depends on coordination mechanisms that remain underdeveloped and stakeholder willingness to collaborate rather than compete.</p>

<p>The <strong>Rural Patient Health Innovation Hubs</strong> represent Ohio&rsquo;s most ambitious initiative, attempting to solve healthcare fragmentation through regional coordination structures. An estimated <strong>25-30% of RHTP funding</strong> ($50-60 million over five years) supports establishing 5-7 geographic hubs across Ohio&rsquo;s rural regions.</p>
<p>Each hub anchors around a <strong>Critical Access Hospital or large FQHC</strong> with strong operational capacity, adequate electronic health record infrastructure, and willingness to serve a coordinating role. Spoke sites connect to the hub, including smaller Critical Access Hospitals, Rural Health Clinics, FQHC satellite sites, and potentially private primary care practices willing to participate.</p>
<p><strong>Regional hub structure</strong> divides rural Ohio into 5-7 geographic regions. Selection criteria for hub anchors likely include existing infrastructure capacity, geographic centrality within region, EHR capabilities, and relationships with regional providers. Each hub coordinates care for a defined population of <strong>100,000-300,000 people</strong> depending on regional geography and density.</p>
<p>The hub does not deliver all care. It <strong>coordinates care delivered across the network</strong>, manages care transitions, tracks high-need patients, and facilitates specialty access through telehealth connections to academic medical centers.</p>
<h3 id="target-population-and-geography">Target Population and Geography<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#target-population-and-geography">#</a></h3>
<p>Hub development prioritizes <strong>Appalachian Ohio&rsquo;s 32 counties</strong> where health disparities concentrate most severely. The southeastern quadrant of the state, stretching from the northeastern corner to the southern border, encompasses communities with the highest poverty rates, worst health outcomes, and most severe provider shortages.</p>
<p>Secondary priority extends to <strong>northwestern agricultural counties</strong> where aging farm populations face access challenges, and <strong>exurban growth counties</strong> around Columbus where population expansion strains infrastructure designed for smaller populations.</p>
<p>Geographic diversity creates implementation complexity. What works in densely populated Athens County may fail in sparsely populated Meigs County. Hub models must accommodate variation or produce uneven results.</p>
<h3 id="implementation-timeline">Implementation Timeline<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#implementation-timeline">#</a></h3>
<p>Hub development follows a phased approach:</p>
<p><strong>2026-2027:</strong> Identify and contract with 2-3 pilot hub anchors; establish governance structures; deploy initial technology infrastructure; recruit care coordination staff.</p>
<p><strong>2027-2028:</strong> Expand to full 5-7 hub network; integrate spoke sites; launch care coordination services; establish telehealth connections.</p>
<p><strong>2028-2030:</strong> Scale population health management; integrate behavioral health and social services; demonstrate outcomes; plan for sustainability.</p>
<p>The <strong>two-year spending requirement</strong> demands aggressive timeline execution, with FY2026 funds obligated by September 30, 2027. This creates pressure to select partners and launch activities before comprehensive planning completes.</p>

<h3 id="design-and-mechanics-1">Design and Mechanics<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#design-and-mechanics-1">#</a></h3>
<p>Ohio&rsquo;s <strong>Emergency Care Transformation</strong> initiative scales a successful pilot enabling EMS to provide treat-in-place or alternate-destination care, reducing unnecessary emergency department use through advanced training, system upgrades, and improved connectivity.</p>
<p>The initiative builds on existing <strong>community paramedicine protocols</strong> that allow trained paramedics to assess patients in the field and determine appropriate care pathways. Rather than transporting all patients to distant emergency departments by default, trained EMS teams can treat minor conditions on scene, transport to urgent care facilities, or connect patients with telehealth consultations.</p>
<p><strong>Target investment of $25-35 million</strong> over five years supports protocol development, EMS training expansion, dispatch system upgrades enabling destination selection, and connectivity infrastructure linking field units to receiving facilities.</p>
<h3 id="target-population-and-geography-1">Target Population and Geography<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#target-population-and-geography-1">#</a></h3>
<p>Rural Ohioans face <strong>average transport times exceeding 30 minutes</strong> to emergency departments in many counties. For time-sensitive conditions, this delay proves fatal. For non-emergent conditions, it consumes resources and creates unnecessary ED crowding.</p>
<p>Emergency Care Transformation targets both scenarios. <strong>Time-sensitive cases</strong> benefit from improved protocol coordination and destination optimization. <strong>Non-emergent cases</strong> receive appropriate care without resource-intensive ED visits.</p>
<p>Geographic prioritization focuses on counties with the longest transport times, highest rates of unnecessary ED utilization, and EMS agencies with capacity for advanced training.</p>
<h3 id="performance-metrics">Performance Metrics<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#performance-metrics">#</a></h3>
<p>Ohio&rsquo;s application commits to measurable outcomes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reduction in unnecessary ED transports</strong> by 15-25% in participating service areas</li>
<li><strong>Improved response times</strong> through optimized dispatch and destination protocols</li>
<li><strong>Patient satisfaction scores</strong> demonstrating acceptance of treat-in-place alternatives</li>
<li><strong>Cost savings</strong> from avoided ED visits and reduced transport distances</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="implementation-dependencies">Implementation Dependencies<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#implementation-dependencies">#</a></h3>
<p>Emergency Care Transformation success depends on factors partially outside RHTP control:</p>
<p><strong>Medical direction</strong> must approve expanded protocols. Physician oversight requirements vary by county medical director philosophy.</p>
<p><strong>Hospital cooperation</strong> enables alternate destinations. Facilities must accept patients from EMS diversion and integrate them into appropriate care pathways.</p>
<p><strong>Reimbursement structures</strong> must support treat-in-place activities. Current payment models reimburse transport but not on-scene treatment, creating financial disincentives for the behavior RHTP encourages.</p>
<p><strong>Workforce availability</strong> constrains expansion. EMS agencies already face staffing shortages. Advanced training requirements further strain limited personnel.</p>

<h3 id="design-and-mechanics-2">Design and Mechanics<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#design-and-mechanics-2">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>School-based health centers</strong> represent Ohio&rsquo;s most visible initiative, targeting rural school districts without existing centers. An estimated <strong>25-30% of RHTP funding</strong> ($50-60 million over five years) supports establishing clinics on K-12 and college campuses offering primary, behavioral, dental, and telehealth services.</p>
<p>The rationale is straightforward. Rural families struggle with transportation to distant clinics. Parents working multiple jobs cannot take time off for children&rsquo;s appointments. Preventive care gets deferred. Chronic conditions go unmanaged. Behavioral health needs go untreated. Schools solve the logistics problem: <strong>children already attend</strong>, school nurses identify health needs, school facilities provide space.</p>
<p>Services provided include <strong>primary care</strong> (acute illness, chronic disease management, physicals, immunizations), <strong>behavioral health counseling</strong>, <strong>dental services</strong> where feasible, and connections to specialty care through telehealth or referral. Centers operate during school hours and ideally extend to after-school hours to accommodate working parents.</p>
<h3 id="target-population-and-geography-2">Target Population and Geography<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#target-population-and-geography-2">#</a></h3>
<p>Selection criteria for new school-based health centers likely include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>High poverty rates</strong> and Medicaid enrollment</li>
<li><strong>Distance from existing primary care</strong> facilities</li>
<li><strong>Lack of alternative pediatric services</strong> in the community</li>
<li><strong>School district willingness</strong> to partner and provide space</li>
<li><strong>Facility availability</strong> meeting clinical requirements</li>
</ul>
<p>Priority goes to <strong>Appalachian counties</strong> and deeply rural districts where access problems are most severe. Urban-adjacent rural districts may rank lower despite similar demographic characteristics because urban alternatives exist within reasonable driving distance.</p>
<h3 id="performance-metrics-1">Performance Metrics<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#performance-metrics-1">#</a></h3>
<p>School-based health center success metrics include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Number of centers established</strong> and operational by 2030</li>
<li><strong>Students served</strong> through annual encounters</li>
<li><strong>Conditions managed</strong> including chronic disease, behavioral health, dental</li>
<li><strong>Immunization rates</strong> among enrolled students</li>
<li><strong>School attendance</strong> changes associated with health center access</li>
<li><strong>Referral completion rates</strong> for specialty services</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sustainability-pathway">Sustainability Pathway<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#sustainability-pathway">#</a></h3>
<p>The critical question: <strong>what happens when RHTP ends in 2030?</strong></p>
<p>School-based health centers can potentially sustain through <strong>Medicaid billing</strong> for eligible services, but reimbursement rarely covers full operational costs. Many successful centers blend Medicaid, grants, and school district contributions. If RHTP funding ends and school districts cannot continue support, centers close.</p>
<p>Ohio&rsquo;s sustainability strategy remains underdeveloped in public application materials. The implicit assumption: centers demonstrating value become embedded in school operations and generate political support for continued funding.</p>

<p>The <strong>OH SEE (Ohio Schools Eye Exams) program</strong> builds on a successful 13-county pilot, expanding statewide mobile vision, hearing, and dental care to ensure early diagnosis and treatment for children.</p>
<p>An estimated <strong>$15-20 million</strong> over five years supports mobile units, screening equipment, trained personnel, and referral coordination. The program provides vision screening in schools and eyeglasses for students who need them, addressing a common but often overlooked barrier to learning.</p>
<p><strong>Vision problems</strong> affect educational achievement when children cannot see boards, read textbooks, or participate fully in classroom activities. Parents facing economic pressure defer vision care. OH SEE eliminates barriers by bringing screening to schools and covering treatment costs.</p>
<h3 id="target-population-and-geography-3">Target Population and Geography<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#target-population-and-geography-3">#</a></h3>
<p>OH SEE expansion targets rural K-12 students across all 73 non-urban counties, with priority for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Counties lacking pediatric vision providers</strong></li>
<li><strong>Districts with high Medicaid enrollment</strong> indicating economic barriers to care</li>
<li><strong>Schools documenting high rates of academic difficulty</strong> potentially linked to undiagnosed vision or hearing problems</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="integration-with-school-based-health-centers">Integration with School-Based Health Centers<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#integration-with-school-based-health-centers">#</a></h3>
<p>OH SEE operates as a <strong>mobile complement</strong> to fixed school-based health centers. Districts with established centers can integrate screening services into center operations. Districts without centers rely on periodic mobile visits.</p>
<p>This tiered approach ensures some level of service reaches all rural students while concentrating infrastructure investment in highest-need areas.</p>

<h3 id="design-and-mechanics-4">Design and Mechanics<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#design-and-mechanics-4">#</a></h3>
<p>Workforce shortage is the root cause that ripples through every other access problem. Ohio cannot staff expanded school-based health centers without providers. It cannot operate innovation hub care teams without care coordinators. It cannot deliver telehealth without clinicians on the other end of connections.</p>
<p>Ohio allocates an estimated <strong>30-35% of total RHTP funding</strong> ($60-70 million over five years) to workforce development through four components:</p>
<p><strong>Medical school partnerships</strong> expand rural training tracks at Ohio&rsquo;s three medical schools. Students who train in rural settings are more likely to practice rurally after residency. RHTP funding expands rural rotation placements, funds preceptorships at Critical Access Hospitals and FQHCs, and creates dedicated rural tracks with longitudinal experience.</p>
<p><strong>Enhanced loan repayment</strong> expands the existing <strong>Ohio Physician Loan Repayment Program</strong> and creates new loan repayment for nurses, physician assistants, behavioral health providers, and dentists. Awards require <strong>five-year rural service commitments</strong> as specified in RHTP statutory requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced practice provider training</strong> focuses on nurse practitioners and physician assistants who can provide primary care services meeting most rural health needs. The initiative expands NP and PA training programs with rural-focused curriculum and establishes clinical training sites in CAHs and RHCs.</p>
<p><strong>Pipeline development</strong> targets high school and college students from rural communities through health career awareness programs, scholarship programs, and mentorship connecting rural students to healthcare professionals.</p>

<p>Workforce pipeline investments face <strong>fundamental timeline constraints</strong>.

RHTP funding ends before medical school pipeline investments produce practicing physicians.</p>
<p>Loan repayment produces faster results because it recruits existing providers rather than training new ones. The tradeoff: loan repayment retains providers on a treadmill, requiring continuous investment rather than building self-sustaining capacity.</p>

<p>Ohio&rsquo;s RHTP application acknowledges <strong>social determinants of health</strong> as contributing factors to rural health disparities. The application references &ldquo;addressing root causes of disease&rdquo; among RHTP&rsquo;s broad goals but provides limited specificity on systematic social care intervention.</p>
<p><strong>SDOH screening</strong> appears embedded within school-based health center and innovation hub initiatives rather than as a standalone program. Centers and hubs would screen patients for social needs including food insecurity, housing instability, transportation barriers, and economic distress.</p>
<p><strong>HRSN navigation</strong> receives implicit rather than explicit treatment. Care coordinators within innovation hubs would theoretically connect patients to community resources addressing identified needs. The application does not describe systematic navigation protocols, staffing models, or performance expectations for social need resolution.</p>
<p>Ohio&rsquo;s existing <strong>Pathways Community HUB model</strong> provides potential infrastructure for social care integration. The model operates through certified HUBs employing community health workers who coordinate care and connect high-risk individuals to services. Integration with RHTP initiatives would leverage existing infrastructure rather than creating parallel systems.</p>

<p>Ohio&rsquo;s application includes CHW deployment within the workforce pipeline initiative rather than as a distinct social care program. The application references &ldquo;upskilling for community health workers&rdquo; and integration of CHWs into care teams at innovation hubs and school-based centers.</p>
<p>The <strong>Community Health Worker Center of Excellence</strong>, established through 2023 legislative action with $2.5 million annual funding, provides coordination infrastructure for CHW workforce development. The Center supports training programs, continuing education, and workforce assessment.</p>
<p>Ohio Medicaid offers <strong>two voluntary alternative payment models</strong> (Comprehensive Primary Care and Comprehensive Maternal Care) that provide enrolled practices with funding to support population health activities including CHW services. RHTP could expand these models to rural areas or create additional CHW positions outside Medicaid frameworks.</p>
<p><strong>Proposed CHW deployment:</strong> Approximately 50-100 CHW positions embedded within innovation hubs and school-based health centers over five years, focusing on high-risk patient navigation and social need coordination.</p>

<p>Ohio&rsquo;s application does not specify a <strong>closed-loop referral platform</strong> requirement or name a CIE vendor for SDOH coordination. This represents a notable gap compared to states with explicit CIE procurement plans.</p>
<p><strong>Existing infrastructure</strong> includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ohio 211</strong> operated by United Way providing basic referral services</li>
<li><strong>Pathways Community HUB</strong> model using care coordination protocols</li>
<li><strong>Various hospital and health system</strong> referral platforms operating independently</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Procurement status:</strong> No active RFP for statewide CIE platform identified in Ohio procurement portals as of January 2026. Integration would likely occur through hub-level decisions rather than statewide mandate.</p>
<h3 id="technology-vendor-landscape">Technology Vendor Landscape<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#technology-vendor-landscape">#</a></h3>
<p>Ohio&rsquo;s SDOH technology landscape remains fragmented:</p>
<p><strong>Unite Us</strong> operates in select Ohio markets but lacks statewide deployment
<strong>Findhelp</strong> (formerly Aunt Bertha) provides resource directory services
<strong>Hospital system proprietary platforms</strong> at major health systems
<strong>Pathways HUB</strong> software at certified community HUBs</p>
<p>RHTP does not mandate vendor consolidation or statewide platform adoption. Individual hubs and health centers would likely make independent technology decisions, perpetuating fragmentation.</p>

<h3 id="how-money-moves">How Money Moves<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-money-moves">#</a></h3>
<p>RHTP funding flows from CMS to Ohio through a <strong>cooperative agreement</strong> structure that provides more federal oversight than a block grant but more state flexibility than a contract.</p>
<p><strong>CMS to ODH:</strong> The full $202 million FY2026 award transfers to the Ohio Department of Health, which holds fiduciary responsibility and reporting obligations.</p>
<p><strong>ODH administrative retention:</strong> An estimated 8-10% ($15-20 million over five years) supports ODH administration, CMS reporting compliance, stakeholder coordination, and performance monitoring.</p>
<p><strong>ODH to initiative offices:</strong> Remaining funds distribute to the Primary Care Office, Bureau of Maternal Child and Family Health, State Office of Rural Health, and EMS based on initiative allocations.</p>
<p><strong>Initiative offices to subawardees:</strong> Each office administers contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements with implementing organizations. Some allocation is competitive (partners apply for specific projects). Some is formula-based (geographic distribution, facility type, service area characteristics).</p>
<h3 id="intermediary-pass-through-arrangements">Intermediary Pass-Through Arrangements<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#intermediary-pass-through-arrangements">#</a></h3>
<p>The <strong>Ohio Hospital Association</strong> serves as a key intermediary for CAH-related activities, receiving RHTP funds for distribution to member facilities along with technical assistance and coordination services.</p>
<p>The <strong>Ohio Association of Community Health Centers</strong> (Primary Care Association) similarly intermediates FQHC participation, coordinating workforce development, training sites, and care delivery expansion across the community health center network.</p>
<p>These intermediary arrangements create efficiency through existing relationships but add administrative layers between federal funding and direct service delivery.</p>
<h3 id="timeline-for-fund-distribution">Timeline for Fund Distribution<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#timeline-for-fund-distribution">#</a></h3>
<p>The <strong>two-year spending requirement</strong> creates aggressive distribution timelines:</p>
<p><strong>Q1 2026:</strong> Award finalization; cooperative agreement execution; ODH budget allocation
<strong>Q2-Q3 2026:</strong> Subaward procurement; partner contracting; initiative launch
<strong>Q4 2026 - Q3 2027:</strong> Service delivery ramp-up; spending acceleration
<strong>By September 30, 2027:</strong> All FY2026 funds obligated</p>
<p>This timeline forces rapid decision-making that may sacrifice planning quality for spending compliance.</p>

<h3 id="how-initiatives-connect">How Initiatives Connect<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-initiatives-connect">#</a></h3>
<p>Ohio&rsquo;s five initiatives and cross-cutting strategies theoretically interconnect into a coherent system:</p>
<p><strong>Workforce enables everything.</strong> Without providers, neither school-based health centers nor innovation hubs can operate. Workforce pipeline investments must precede or parallel service expansion.</p>
<p><strong>Hubs coordinate complexity.</strong> When school-based health centers encounter cases beyond their capacity, hub networks provide referral pathways and specialty access through telehealth.</p>
<p><strong>EMS integrates with hubs.</strong> Emergency Care Transformation protocols connect to hub coordination, allowing field triage decisions informed by hub capacity and appropriate destination selection.</p>
<p><strong>Technology enables connections.</strong> Interoperable electronic health records, telehealth platforms, and shared patient tracking systems make coordination possible across organizational boundaries.</p>
<h3 id="sequencing-and-dependencies">Sequencing and Dependencies<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#sequencing-and-dependencies">#</a></h3>
<p>Effective implementation requires sequencing that RHTP timelines may not permit:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Technology infrastructure</strong> must precede care coordination (cannot coordinate without connected systems)</li>
<li><strong>Workforce recruitment</strong> must precede service expansion (cannot deliver without providers)</li>
<li><strong>Hub anchor selection</strong> must precede spoke integration (cannot coordinate without coordinators)</li>
<li><strong>Training</strong> must precede protocol deployment (cannot implement without prepared personnel)</li>
</ol>
<p>The two-year spending requirement pressures parallel rather than sequential implementation, risking misalignment between infrastructure and services.</p>
<h3 id="integration-challenges">Integration Challenges<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#integration-challenges">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Competing organizational interests</strong> may undermine coordination goals. Hospitals and FQHCs often compete for patients. Getting competitors to collaborate requires either strong financial incentives or recognition that coordination serves everyone&rsquo;s interest. RHTP provides neither sustained financial incentives beyond five years nor guarantees that collaboration outweighs competition.</p>
<p><strong>Multiple ODH offices</strong> with distinct initiatives may produce parallel streams rather than integrated programs. Without a single empowered integrator enforcing alignment, initiatives proceed independently. The result: visible progress on multiple fronts, insufficient system-level change.</p>

<h3 id="two-year-obligation-requirement">Two-Year Obligation Requirement<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#two-year-obligation-requirement">#</a></h3>
<p>Ohio must obligate FY2026 funds ($202 million) by <strong>September 30, 2027</strong>. This creates a 21-month window to structure subawards, select partners, launch initiatives, and demonstrate progress.</p>
<p>The requirement forces action and overcomes bureaucratic inertia. It also risks hasty implementation and insufficient planning.</p>
<p><strong>Front-loading</strong> spending in 2026-2027 means workforce loan repayment awards, school-based health center construction, and hub contracting must occur within the first year. Aggressive timelines favor ready partners over optimal partners.</p>

<h3 id="explicit-assumptions">Explicit Assumptions<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#explicit-assumptions">#</a></h3>
<p>Ohio&rsquo;s application explicitly assumes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Existing infrastructure can be leveraged</strong> rather than built anew</li>
<li><strong>Provider recruitment responds</strong> to enhanced loan repayment incentives</li>
<li><strong>School districts will partner</strong> for school-based health centers</li>
<li><strong>Regional coordination produces value</strong> that motivates participant collaboration</li>
<li><strong>Technology deployment overcomes</strong> fragmentation barriers</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="implicit-assumptions">Implicit Assumptions<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#implicit-assumptions">#</a></h3>
<p>The plan implicitly assumes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Political stability</strong> maintains Medicaid expansion and RHTP support through 2030</li>
<li><strong>CMS continues funding</strong> at projected levels without major adjustments</li>
<li><strong>Rural communities accept</strong> transformed care models</li>
<li><strong>Stakeholders collaborate</strong> despite competitive market dynamics</li>
<li><strong>Social care components</strong> can function without dedicated CIE infrastructure</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="risks-acknowledged-vs-ignored">Risks Acknowledged vs. Ignored<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#risks-acknowledged-vs-ignored">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Acknowledged risks:</strong> Provider recruitment difficulty; implementation timeline pressure; geographic variation; sustainability post-2030.</p>
<p><strong>Ignored risks:</strong> Medicaid cuts eliminating coverage gains; hub coordination failures; technology interoperability barriers; social care defunding under resource constraints; political shifts reducing state commitment.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>Ohio&rsquo;s RHTP plan is <strong>comprehensive, conventional, and cautious</strong>. The five initiatives and cross-cutting strategies represent proven approaches that work in rural health contexts elsewhere. Ohio is not experimenting. It is scaling what exists.</p>
<p>The strategy emphasizes <strong>leveraging existing infrastructure</strong> over building anew, proven models over untested innovations, and visible wins over structural transformation. This approach has the virtue of achievability within five years and $202 million. It also has the limitation of accepting existing capacity as sufficient when evidence suggests otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>Social care integration survives as documentation, not delivery.</strong> Ohio will screen for social needs. Whether those needs get addressed depends on community resources existing independently of RHTP, not on systematic intervention funded by transformation dollars.</p>
<p><strong>The interconnected system exists on paper.</strong> Whether workforce, hubs, school-based centers, EMS transformation, and technology actually function as an integrated system depends on coordination mechanisms that remain underdeveloped and stakeholder willingness to prioritize collaboration over competition.</p>
<p>Part 3 will assess whether the plan can work, what survives when constraints bite, and what Ohio&rsquo;s choices reveal about stated versus actual priorities. The question is not whether $202 million produces visible progress. It will. The question is whether visible progress constitutes transformation or merely activity dressed in transformation rhetoric.</p>
