  "articleBody": "The Rural Health Transformation Program’s $50 billion investment encounters a fundamental tension in its social care infrastructure: states rank social determinants work approximately fifteenth on priority lists behind workforce, technology, and operational concerns. This technical inventory documents which states protected social care investment and which allowed these components to erode under budget pressure across screening for social determinants of health (SDOH), navigation of health-related social needs (HRSN), deployment of community health workers (CHWs), and implementation of community information exchange (CIE) platforms for closed-loop referrals.\nThe assessment framework distinguishes six funding statuses: funded components preserved with dedicated budget lines, partial funding where some elements survived while others faced reduction, at-risk initiatives included in applications but vulnerable to implementation cuts, cut components explicitly removed post-award, embedded social care incorporated within other initiatives without dedicated funding, and unknown status where insufficient documentation prevents assessment. This categorization reveals that social care vulnerability extends beyond rhetorical commitment to actual budget allocation, with several states nominally supporting these interventions while providing no dedicated resources.\nCalifornia demonstrates the fully integrated model where CalAIM managed care plan mandates require SDOH screening and HRSN navigation through Enhanced Care Management lead care managers, backed by billions in CalAIM funding. However, this integration paradoxically creates market barriers: the state paused CHW certification in November 2023 despite maintaining an active Medi-Cal benefit paying $31.74 per 30 minutes, constraining workforce growth even as services expand. The CalAIM framework effectively closes traditional CIE markets since managed care plans deploy their own tools, making California simultaneously the most comprehensive and least accessible state for social care platform vendors.\nTexas presents the opposite scenario with the nation’s largest rural population of 4.96 million but fragmented regional CIE deployments through Findhelp (11 health systems, 8 FQHCs, Superior MCO) and Unite Us (Lubbock) without statewide coordination. The state maintains the most mature CHW infrastructure nationally, requiring certification since 2001 through the Department of State Health Services with 49 certified training programs, yet limits Medicaid reimbursement to specific populations under HB 113 and HB 1575. This creates a workforce prepared for integration but operating without sustainable financing or coordinated technology, representing substantial platform opportunity paired with policy fragmentation that has prevented comprehensive deployment despite two decades of workforce development.\nMississippi and Georgia share complete CIE infrastructure absence but diverge in trajectory. Mississippi includes social care components in its RHTP application albeit at-risk for implementation cuts, while HB 1401 enacted in 2025 directs development of CHW certification and instructs the Division of Medicaid to pursue a state plan amendment for reimbursement, establishing emerging pathways despite current gaps. Georgia explicitly excluded social care from its RHTP application despite having the region’s worst coverage gap with 175,000 residents in the partial Pathways expansion but only 6,500 enrolled, demonstrating how political decisions rather than need determine social care prioritization. Alabama extends this pattern with no CIE infrastructure, no CHW certification, and no Medicaid reimbursement, creating what the inventory terms “critical” opportunity gaps in states where rural health needs run highest.\nTennessee and North Carolina operate statewide CIE platforms that predate RHTP, with Tennessee deploying Findhelp’s Community Compass since 2015 through MCO partnerships and North Carolina achieving coverage across all 100 counties through NCCARE360 built on Unite Us. These mature deployments create substantial market entry barriers for competing platforms while demonstrating sustainable models, though Tennessee lacks CHW Medicaid reimbursement despite voluntary certification through TNCHWA, and North Carolina faces service delivery threats from Healthy Opportunities Pilot discontinuation despite CHW integration with managed care. The contrast illustrates how platform maturity and workforce financing operate as separate policy domains requiring distinct implementation pathways.\nThe Appalachian region demonstrates robust CHW infrastructure without sustainable financing or statewide coordination. Ohio maintains the nation’s most developed Pathways HUB network with 12 certified hubs covering 70-plus counties, but these hubs lack interoperability and the state has no statewide CIE platform, creating federated structure without technical integration. Kentucky operates the 30-year Homeplace program showing CHW effectiveness alongside recently approved TEAMKY 1115 waiver provisions for recuperative care and recovery residence support, yet has no statewide CIE to coordinate these services. West Virginia receives the highest per-capita RHTP funding nationally at $574 per rural resident and operates the CHERP training pipeline producing CHWs, but maintains only WVU Medicine’s findhelp deployment rather than statewide infrastructure. All three states limit MCO-mediated CHW reimbursement to maternal and substance use disorder populations, excluding chronic disease management and community-based organizations from sustainable financing despite documented workforce capacity.\nOklahoma represents an emerging opportunity where 2024 state plan amendment approval created CHW Medicaid reimbursement without requiring certification under the C3 framework, establishing a services pathway concurrent with minimal existing CIE infrastructure through limited Unite Oklahoma presence. This combination of financing mechanism without workforce credentialing requirements or coordinated technology creates a greenfield environment for rapid deployment, though managed care transition introduces implementation uncertainty. The state illustrates how policy sequencing affects infrastructure development when financing precedes rather than follows workforce preparation and platform selection.\nPlatform vendor concentration shows distinct regional patterns. Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and New Mexico operate statewide single-vendor deployments on Findhelp, while Connecticut, Rhode Island, Minnesota, Arizona, and North Carolina similarly standardized on Unite Us. New York maintains the sole statewide dual-vendor approach with both Unite Us and Findhelp. However, most states operate regional deployments creating fragmented landscapes where California’s managed care plan integration, Texas’s multi-vendor pockets, and Ohio’s Pathways HUB federation demonstrate different fragmentation modes. Several states including Mississippi, Georgia, Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, West Virginia, Nevada, Alaska, and New Hampshire maintain no confirmed CIE infrastructure, with these gaps concentrated in non-expansion states and Appalachian regions despite high rural health need.\nCHW Medicaid reimbursement through state plan amendments exists in Minnesota (the pioneer), Indiana, Arizona, New York, Michigan, New Mexico, Washington, Wisconsin, Nevada, Rhode Island, Kansas, South Dakota, Louisiana, Arkansas, and newly Oklahoma with 2024 approval. Colorado approved its SPA but delayed implementation until 2028. Mississippi’s HB 1401 directs SPA development without timeline specification. However, several states maintain certification infrastructure without Medicaid coverage, creating trained workforces operating on grant funding or employer direct payment. Texas exemplifies this pattern most dramatically with mandatory certification since 2001 but reimbursement limited to specific populations, while California paused certification despite maintaining broad benefit coverage. This divergence between workforce preparation and financing sustainability emerges as a critical implementation gap where policy symbolic commitment exceeds budget reality.\nThe integration model taxonomy reveals seven distinct approaches beyond platform selection. Platform-mediated models where CIE technology drives referrals operate in North Carolina, Tennessee, Oregon, New York, Vermont (planned), Washington (developing), and others. Hub-based models in Kentucky, Alabama, Mississippi, and Ohio’s Pathways network use regional coordinators within defined geographies. Managed care-based approaches in Oklahoma, Hawaii, Minnesota, Michigan, California’s CalAIM, and Texas’s fragmented landscape make MCOs responsible for SDOH services with RHTP supplementing rather than replacing these functions. CHW-based models in West Virginia, Kansas, and Arkansas emphasize workforce navigation without dedicated platforms. Massachusetts operates an ACO-based model where accountable care organizations integrate social care coordination. Maryland demonstrates HIE-integrated tools through CRISP where the health information exchange incorporates social care functionality. South Carolina’s mobile-based approach uses health units for delivery in underserved areas. This taxonomy matters because vendor opportunity varies substantially: platform-mediated states favor CIE technology companies, hub-based states may resist platform consolidation preferring regional autonomy, and managed care-based states often close markets to external vendors through MCO contracts.\nThe research documents information asymmetry across states with public documentation availability varying dramatically, creating methodological limitations around embedded versus distinct funding where difficulty distinguishing genuinely funded initiatives from nominal inclusion affects assessment accuracy. Several states categorized as “unknown” for major components reflect documentation absence rather than program absence, particularly in states with limited digital transparency or those implementing through existing managed care contracts without separate RHTP visibility. Timing constraints matter since this January 2026 assessment captures a moment when implementation planning proceeds but few states have executed full deployments, meaning status classifications represent intended rather than operational infrastructure in many cases.\nThe core tension this inventory exposes runs deeper than individual state choices about which components to fund or defer. Social care infrastructure requires simultaneous advancement across workforce certification and training, Medicaid reimbursement mechanisms, technology platforms for coordination, and provider willingness to screen and refer beyond clinical services. States advancing on one dimension while neglecting others create partial systems where CHWs lack sustainable financing, platforms lack\n",

<p>The Rural Health Transformation Program&rsquo;s $50 billion investment encounters a fundamental tension in its social care infrastructure: states rank social determinants work approximately fifteenth on priority lists behind workforce, technology, and operational concerns. This technical inventory documents which states protected social care investment and which allowed these components to erode under budget pressure across screening for social determinants of health (SDOH), navigation of health-related social needs (HRSN), deployment of community health workers (CHWs), and implementation of community information exchange (CIE) platforms for closed-loop referrals.</p>
<p>The assessment framework distinguishes six funding statuses: funded components preserved with dedicated budget lines, partial funding where some elements survived while others faced reduction, at-risk initiatives included in applications but vulnerable to implementation cuts, cut components explicitly removed post-award, embedded social care incorporated within other initiatives without dedicated funding, and unknown status where insufficient documentation prevents assessment. This categorization reveals that social care vulnerability extends beyond rhetorical commitment to actual budget allocation, with several states nominally supporting these interventions while providing no dedicated resources.</p>
<p>California demonstrates the fully integrated model where CalAIM managed care plan mandates require SDOH screening and HRSN navigation through Enhanced Care Management lead care managers, backed by billions in CalAIM funding. However, this integration paradoxically creates market barriers: the state paused CHW certification in November 2023 despite maintaining an active Medi-Cal benefit paying $31.74 per 30 minutes, constraining workforce growth even as services expand. The CalAIM framework effectively closes traditional CIE markets since managed care plans deploy their own tools, making California simultaneously the most comprehensive and least accessible state for social care platform vendors.</p>
<p>Texas presents the opposite scenario with the nation&rsquo;s largest rural population of 4.96 million but fragmented regional CIE deployments through Findhelp (11 health systems, 8 FQHCs, Superior MCO) and Unite Us (Lubbock) without statewide coordination. The state maintains the most mature CHW infrastructure nationally, requiring certification since 2001 through the Department of State Health Services with 49 certified training programs, yet limits Medicaid reimbursement to specific populations under HB 113 and HB 1575. This creates a workforce prepared for integration but operating without sustainable financing or coordinated technology, representing substantial platform opportunity paired with policy fragmentation that has prevented comprehensive deployment despite two decades of workforce development.</p>
<p>Mississippi and Georgia share complete CIE infrastructure absence but diverge in trajectory. Mississippi includes social care components in its RHTP application albeit at-risk for implementation cuts, while HB 1401 enacted in 2025 directs development of CHW certification and instructs the Division of Medicaid to pursue a state plan amendment for reimbursement, establishing emerging pathways despite current gaps. Georgia explicitly excluded social care from its RHTP application despite having the region&rsquo;s worst coverage gap with 175,000 residents in the partial Pathways expansion but only 6,500 enrolled, demonstrating how political decisions rather than need determine social care prioritization. Alabama extends this pattern with no CIE infrastructure, no CHW certification, and no Medicaid reimbursement, creating what the inventory terms &ldquo;critical&rdquo; opportunity gaps in states where rural health needs run highest.</p>
<p>Tennessee and North Carolina operate statewide CIE platforms that predate RHTP, with Tennessee deploying Findhelp&rsquo;s Community Compass since 2015 through MCO partnerships and North Carolina achieving coverage across all 100 counties through NCCARE360 built on Unite Us. These mature deployments create substantial market entry barriers for competing platforms while demonstrating sustainable models, though Tennessee lacks CHW Medicaid reimbursement despite voluntary certification through TNCHWA, and North Carolina faces service delivery threats from Healthy Opportunities Pilot discontinuation despite CHW integration with managed care. The contrast illustrates how platform maturity and workforce financing operate as separate policy domains requiring distinct implementation pathways.</p>
<p>The Appalachian region demonstrates robust CHW infrastructure without sustainable financing or statewide coordination. Ohio maintains the nation&rsquo;s most developed Pathways HUB network with 12 certified hubs covering 70-plus counties, but these hubs lack interoperability and the state has no statewide CIE platform, creating federated structure without technical integration. Kentucky operates the 30-year Homeplace program showing CHW effectiveness alongside recently approved TEAMKY 1115 waiver provisions for recuperative care and recovery residence support, yet has no statewide CIE to coordinate these services. West Virginia receives the highest per-capita RHTP funding nationally at $574 per rural resident and operates the CHERP training pipeline producing CHWs, but maintains only WVU Medicine&rsquo;s findhelp deployment rather than statewide infrastructure. All three states limit MCO-mediated CHW reimbursement to maternal and substance use disorder populations, excluding chronic disease management and community-based organizations from sustainable financing despite documented workforce capacity.</p>
<p>Oklahoma represents an emerging opportunity where 2024 state plan amendment approval created CHW Medicaid reimbursement without requiring certification under the C3 framework, establishing a services pathway concurrent with minimal existing CIE infrastructure through limited Unite Oklahoma presence. This combination of financing mechanism without workforce credentialing requirements or coordinated technology creates a greenfield environment for rapid deployment, though managed care transition introduces implementation uncertainty. The state illustrates how policy sequencing affects infrastructure development when financing precedes rather than follows workforce preparation and platform selection.</p>
<p>Platform vendor concentration shows distinct regional patterns. Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and New Mexico operate statewide single-vendor deployments on Findhelp, while Connecticut, Rhode Island, Minnesota, Arizona, and North Carolina similarly standardized on Unite Us. New York maintains the sole statewide dual-vendor approach with both Unite Us and Findhelp. However, most states operate regional deployments creating fragmented landscapes where California&rsquo;s managed care plan integration, Texas&rsquo;s multi-vendor pockets, and Ohio&rsquo;s Pathways HUB federation demonstrate different fragmentation modes. Several states including Mississippi, Georgia, Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, West Virginia, Nevada, Alaska, and New Hampshire maintain no confirmed CIE infrastructure, with these gaps concentrated in non-expansion states and Appalachian regions despite high rural health need.</p>
<p>CHW Medicaid reimbursement through state plan amendments exists in Minnesota (the pioneer), Indiana, Arizona, New York, Michigan, New Mexico, Washington, Wisconsin, Nevada, Rhode Island, Kansas, South Dakota, Louisiana, Arkansas, and newly Oklahoma with 2024 approval. Colorado approved its SPA but delayed implementation until 2028. Mississippi&rsquo;s HB 1401 directs SPA development without timeline specification. However, several states maintain certification infrastructure without Medicaid coverage, creating trained workforces operating on grant funding or employer direct payment. Texas exemplifies this pattern most dramatically with mandatory certification since 2001 but reimbursement limited to specific populations, while California paused certification despite maintaining broad benefit coverage. This divergence between workforce preparation and financing sustainability emerges as a critical implementation gap where policy symbolic commitment exceeds budget reality.</p>
<p>The integration model taxonomy reveals seven distinct approaches beyond platform selection. Platform-mediated models where CIE technology drives referrals operate in North Carolina, Tennessee, Oregon, New York, Vermont (planned), Washington (developing), and others. Hub-based models in Kentucky, Alabama, Mississippi, and Ohio&rsquo;s Pathways network use regional coordinators within defined geographies. Managed care-based approaches in Oklahoma, Hawaii, Minnesota, Michigan, California&rsquo;s CalAIM, and Texas&rsquo;s fragmented landscape make MCOs responsible for SDOH services with RHTP supplementing rather than replacing these functions. CHW-based models in West Virginia, Kansas, and Arkansas emphasize workforce navigation without dedicated platforms. Massachusetts operates an ACO-based model where accountable care organizations integrate social care coordination. Maryland demonstrates HIE-integrated tools through CRISP where the health information exchange incorporates social care functionality. South Carolina&rsquo;s mobile-based approach uses health units for delivery in underserved areas. This taxonomy matters because vendor opportunity varies substantially: platform-mediated states favor CIE technology companies, hub-based states may resist platform consolidation preferring regional autonomy, and managed care-based states often close markets to external vendors through MCO contracts.</p>
<p>The research documents information asymmetry across states with public documentation availability varying dramatically, creating methodological limitations around embedded versus distinct funding where difficulty distinguishing genuinely funded initiatives from nominal inclusion affects assessment accuracy. Several states categorized as &ldquo;unknown&rdquo; for major components reflect documentation absence rather than program absence, particularly in states with limited digital transparency or those implementing through existing managed care contracts without separate RHTP visibility. Timing constraints matter since this January 2026 assessment captures a moment when implementation planning proceeds but few states have executed full deployments, meaning status classifications represent intended rather than operational infrastructure in many cases.</p>
<p>The core tension this inventory exposes runs deeper than individual state choices about which components to fund or defer. Social care infrastructure requires simultaneous advancement across workforce certification and training, Medicaid reimbursement mechanisms, technology platforms for coordination, and provider willingness to screen and refer beyond clinical services. States advancing on one dimension while neglecting others create partial systems where CHWs lack sustainable financing, platforms lack</p>
