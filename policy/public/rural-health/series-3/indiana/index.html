  "articleBody": "Indiana received $207 million in FY2026 RHTP funding, exceeding the $200 million the state requested in its November 2025 application. Governor Mike Braun called the award “an incredible opportunity” to ensure rural Hoosiers have “the same opportunities to thrive as their urban neighbors.” The program, branded GROW (Growing Rural Opportunities for Well-being): Cultivating Rural Health, reflects both the agricultural metaphor central to the state’s identity and the governor’s Make Rural Indiana Healthy Again initiative.\nThe five-year projected total of approximately $1 billion arrives at a critical moment. Indiana operates 52 rural hospitals, with 25% having already cut services according to the Centers for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform. The state’s 35 Critical Access Hospitals anchor healthcare delivery across 64 rural counties, serving a population that experiences higher rates of chronic disease, fewer local specialists, and repeated closures of maternity and emergency services.\nYet RHTP investment coincides with Indiana’s controversial HIP (Healthy Indiana Plan) overhaul, which reintroduces work reporting requirements and creates enrollment pressures on the very Medicaid expansion population that rural providers depend upon for revenue. The $207 million annual investment cannot offset the coverage losses that policy changes may generate.\nRural Health Landscape State Context Indiana spans 36,420 square miles across 92 counties, with approximately 1.4 million rural residents comprising roughly 30% of the state’s 6.8 million population. The Indiana Rural Health Association classifies 64 of 92 counties as rural, representing roughly two-thirds of the state’s geography but concentrating populations in agricultural communities that define the state’s character.\nMetric Value Total Population 6.8 million Rural Population ~1.4 million Percentage Rural ~29% Total Counties 92 Rural Counties 64 Counties Medically Underserved 67 Sixty-seven of Indiana’s 92 counties hold Medically Underserved Area or Population designations from the Indiana State Department of Health. This figure exceeds the rural county count, indicating that workforce shortages and access limitations extend into semi-urban communities surrounding metropolitan areas like Indianapolis, Fort Wayne, and Evansville.\nIndiana’s rural character differs from frontier states. Communities are not isolated by hundreds of miles of empty territory. Instead, they face the paradox of proximity: close enough to urban centers that specialty services concentrate there, yet far enough that access requires substantial travel for populations that are older, poorer, and sicker than their urban counterparts. Eighteen percent of rural Indiana residents are over 65, compared to 15% in urban areas.\nHealthcare Infrastructure Indiana maintains a substantial but strained rural healthcare network:\nFacility Type Count Notes Critical Access Hospitals 35 Across 34 counties Rural Hospitals (Total) 52 25% have cut services Federally Qualified Health Centers 27 Plus 8 Look-Alikes Rural Health Clinics 100+ Primary care access points The 35 Critical Access Hospitals operate across 34 counties, providing the only local hospital care for communities where alternatives lie 35 or more miles distant. The Indiana Hospital Association notes that the CAH map reveals troubling gaps: multiple rural counties have no acute care hospital at all, while others lack obstetric services entirely.\nIndiana CAHs recognized for performance include:\nDecatur County Memorial Hospital (Greencastle): 2022 Chartis Top 100 Perry County Memorial Hospital (Tell City): Achieved $5 million financial turnaround Union Hospital Clinton: 2022 Community Impact Award Greene County General Hospital: 2024 Patient Experience Award The Indiana Rural Health Association coordinates FLEX Program support for all 35 CAHs, providing educational programs focused on leadership, quality improvement, and hospital operations. This infrastructure positions Indiana to leverage RHTP investment through existing technical assistance capacity.\nHealth Professional Shortages Indiana’s workforce crisis extends across all provider categories:\nDesignation Type Affected Counties Primary Care HPSA 64 counties Mental Health HPSA 83 counties Dental HPSA 54 counties Medically Underserved 67 counties Eighty-three of 92 counties lack adequate mental health providers, making behavioral health the most severe shortage category. The state ranks in the bottom 20% nationally for general pediatricians per 100,000 children, with developmental specialists facing multi-month waiting lists that rural families cannot easily navigate.\nA 2025 rural community health survey conducted for the RHTP application drew more than 2,100 responses identifying top concerns: long travel times to care, lack of specialty access, difficulty managing chronic conditions, and limited behavioral health services. Sixty percent of Indiana’s population lives in designated Health Professional Shortage Areas, a figure that exceeds what rural population percentages alone would predict.\nAgricultural Economy Context Indiana’s economic structure creates distinct health challenges. The state’s agricultural economy, centered on corn, soybeans, and livestock production, generates employment but carries occupational hazards. Agricultural workers face exposure to chemicals, machinery accidents, respiratory conditions from grain dust and confined animal operations, and mental health stresses from economic uncertainty and weather dependence.\nThe Indiana Rural Health Association notes that rural communities rely heavily on agriculture, farming, and natural resources, creating risks that compound health vulnerabilities. Seasonal employment variations create insurance coverage gaps, while isolated work conditions contribute to injury rates 40% higher than urban areas.\nMedian household income stands at approximately $62,000, below national averages, with rural counties showing significantly lower income levels than urban counterparts. The state’s 10.99% poverty rate concentrates in rural communities where limited transportation options compound economic disadvantage.\nRHTP Award and Context Metric Indiana National Average FY2026 Award $207 million $200 million Five-Year Projected Total ~$1 billion ~$1 billion Rural Population ~1.4 million Varies Per-Capita (Rural) ~$148 ~$150 Award Rank Above Average N/A CAH Count 35 28 average Indiana’s above-average award reflects multiple formula factors working in the state’s favor. The application emphasized chronic disease management, behavioral health, and regional collaboration, aligning with CMS priorities. Governor Braun’s existing Make Rural Indiana Healthy Again initiative provided a framework that reviewers could evaluate against demonstrated state commitment.\nFormula Position Indiana benefits modestly from RHTP’s allocation structure:\n50% equal distribution: $100 million baseline regardless of rural population 50% workload factors: $107 million based on rurality metrics and application scoring The $107 million workload allocation positions Indiana slightly above median. At $148 per rural resident, Indiana receives less per-capita than frontier states like Montana or Wyoming (exceeding $300 per rural resident) but more than large rural population states like Texas ($60 per rural resident).\nMedicaid Expansion Status Indiana expanded Medicaid through the Healthy Indiana Plan (HIP 2.0) beginning in February 2015, making it one of the later expansion states among those that ultimately adopted the ACA provisions. Unlike standard expansion, HIP 2.0 operates through Section 1115 waiver authority with state-specific modifications including POWER account contributions and tiered benefit structures.\nCurrent HIP enrollment exceeds 680,000 Hoosiers, representing the primary coverage mechanism for many rural residents. The 90% federal match for expansion populations makes HIP fiscally advantageous for the state, with Indiana’s share covered through hospital assessment fees and cigarette taxes rather than general fund appropriations.\nHowever, the 2025 legislative session passed Senate Enrolled Act 2, which reintroduces previously halted work reporting requirements and creates mechanisms to limit enrollment based on available appropriations. While explicit enrollment caps were removed, the bill’s structure allows the FSSA secretary to restrict enrollment if funding sources prove insufficient.\nState Approach Governance and Lead Agencies Indiana designated a collaborative leadership structure with the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration (FSSA) and the Indiana Department of Health (IDOH) serving as joint lead agencies under Governor Braun’s direction. The RHTP Working Group includes:\nExecutive Oversight:\nMitch Roob, Secretary, FSSA Lindsay Weaver, MD, State Health Commissioner, IDOH Key Partners:\nIndiana Rural Health Association (implementation support) Indiana Hospital Association (provider coordination) CareSource Indiana (managed care perspective) Purdue University (research and evaluation) This dual-agency structure recognizes that rural health transformation requires both Medicaid expertise (FSSA) and public health infrastructure (IDOH). The working group engaged stakeholders across the state through five formal sessions and informal gatherings to inform application development.\nThe GROW Framework Indiana’s application organizes 12 initiatives around five strategic goals:\nGoal 1: Make Rural Indiana Healthy Again Focus on rural health innovations and new access points promoting preventive care and addressing chronic disease prevention through evidence-based, outcomes-driven interventions.\nGoal 2: Provide Sustainable Access Strengthen long-term sustainability of rural clinicians and facilities by improving efficiency and collaboration between rural providers and regional systems.\nGoal 3: Workforce Development Attract and retain healthcare providers through recruitment, training, and scope-of-practice optimization, including community health workers and patient navigators.\nGoal 4: Innovative Care Develop and implement care models and payment mechanisms incentivizing providers to reduce costs while improving quality.\nGoal 5: Tech Innovation Foster innovative technologies supporting efficient care delivery, data security, and digital health tools for rural facilities, providers, and patients.\nProgram and Funding Distribution Initiative Five-Year Allocation Focus Make Rural Indiana Healthy Again Regional Grants $600 million Regional coalitions, local priorities Health Information Exchange Modernization $66.5 million HIE connectivity, AI integration Cardiometabolic Care Sites $56.2 million Diabetes, hypertension, obesity Transfer Coordination Hub TBD Patient routing, EMS coordination Behavioral Health Workforce TBD Training, recruitment, retention Rural Residency Programs TBD Physician pipeline development Telehealth Expansion TBD Virtual care infrastructure Make Rural Indiana Healthy Again Regional Grants The $600 million regional grant program represents Indiana’s largest RHTP investment, distributing $40 million to $100 million across eight regions over five years. This approach reflects the philosophy that “local communities know their needs best.”\nRegional coalitions must submit unified applications including:\nComprehensive needs assessments Data-sharing plans and service-delivery innovations Detailed budgets with measurable health-performance objectives Letters of support documenting partnerships Required outcomes include improved maternal health, reduced preventable ED visits, increased telehealth utilization, and better chronic disease control. Regions compete on population served, partnership strength, innovation evidence, sustainability plans, and service duplication reduction.\nRegional grant applications open March 2026, with awards finalized by October 2026. This timeline creates implementation pressure but allows regional coalitions time to organize.\nHealth Information Exchange Modernization The $66.5 million HIE initiative addresses a critical infrastructure gap. Indiana’s health information exchange currently connects approximately 120 hospitals but leaves roughly 700 rural facilities outside the system, creating major gaps in care coordination.\nThe initiative proposes connecting 450 of those 700 facilities through:\nTechnology adoption incentives for rural providers Full integration with state HIE architecture AI tools for predictive analytics and natural language processing Medical error reduction through improved data sharing This investment recognizes that transformation requires information infrastructure. Rural facilities cannot participate in coordinated care models if they lack electronic connectivity to the broader system.\nCardiometabolic Care Sites Indiana proposes launching eight rural cardiometabolic care sites statewide through collaborative care models and training programs. The $56.2 million investment targets the state’s high rates of diabetes, hypertension, and obesity, conditions that drive chronic disease burden and healthcare costs.\nThe initiative combines primary care capacity building with specialty integration, creating sustainable treatment pathways for conditions that historically required travel to urban centers.\nSocial Care Integration Component Included Allocation Status SDOH/HRSN Yes Not specified Embedded in regional grants CHW Programs Yes Not specified Workforce initiative component CIE Platform Partial Part of HIE Indiana 211 integration Social Determinants Focus Indiana’s application addresses social determinants through multiple mechanisms rather than standalone initiatives:\nRegional Grant Requirements: Applications must include needs assessments covering food insecurity, transportation barriers, and social isolation, issues the rural survey identified as top concerns.\nIndiana 211 Integration: FSSA’s Indiana 211 system provides existing resource navigation infrastructure that RHTP initiatives can leverage for closed-loop referrals.\nHIE SDOH Capabilities: The health information exchange modernization includes capacity for social needs data sharing alongside clinical information.\nCommunity Health Worker Strategy Indiana’s workforce initiative includes community health workers, pharmacists practicing at expanded scope, and patient navigators as part of the broader healthcare workforce development strategy. The approach embeds CHW deployment within regional coalition applications rather than creating centralized CHW programs.\nSurvival Assessment: CHW components face vulnerability under partial funding scenarios. Unlike standalone initiatives with dedicated budgets, embedding CHWs in regional grants means their deployment depends on regional coalition priorities and may vary significantly across the state.\nKey Subawardees Indiana’s regional approach means most RHTP funds will flow through competitive subawards to regional coalitions rather than direct allocation to named organizations. However, several entities hold significant implementation roles:\nIndiana Rural Health Association Role: FLEX Program coordination, technical assistance, CAH support RHTP Function: Implementation partner for statewide initiatives affecting Critical Access Hospitals\nIndiana Hospital Association Role: Provider advocacy, coordination, policy engagement RHTP Function: Convening rural hospitals, facilitating regional coalition formation\nCareSource Indiana Role: Managed care organization serving Medicaid population RHTP Function: Working group member, rural access expertise through Project ECHO telehealth\nPurdue University Role: Research, evaluation, governmental relations RHTP Function: Working group participant, potential evaluation partner\nTechnology vendors for HIE modernization and AI integration will be selected through RFI/RFP processes. The state indicated vendor assessment would begin following CMS award announcement.\nAssessment Strengths Regional Flexibility: The $600 million regional grant structure allows communities to address local priorities rather than mandating uniform statewide programs. Rural healthcare needs vary significantly between agricultural southern Indiana and manufacturing-focused northern counties.\nExisting Infrastructure: Indiana’s CAH network, FLEX Program, and Indiana 211 system provide foundations for transformation. The state is not building from scratch but augmenting established programs.\nHIE Investment: The $66.5 million to connect 450 facilities addresses genuine interoperability gaps that limit care coordination. This infrastructure investment creates capacity for future innovation.\nStakeholder Engagement: The RHTP Working Group process engaged hospitals, health systems, managed care plans, academics, and legislators, building coalitions that implementation requires.\nState Commitment: Governor Braun’s Make Rural Indiana Healthy Again initiative predates RHTP, providing policy alignment between federal funding and state priorities.\nVulnerabilities Medicaid Policy Risk: The HIP overhaul (SEA 2) reintroduces work reporting requirements that research shows lead to coverage losses even among people who meet the requirements. Building transformation infrastructure for populations that may lose coverage during the grant period inverts the program’s logic.\nRegional Variation: The competitive regional grant structure means some areas will receive significantly more investment than others. Communities without strong coalition formation capacity may be disadvantaged regardless of health need.\nSocial Care Gaps: Unlike states with dedicated SDOH initiatives, Indiana embeds social care in regional grants without specifying minimum investment levels. This approach creates inconsistency risk.\nPer-Capita Limitations: At $148 per rural resident, Indiana cannot invest as intensively per community as frontier states. The 35-CAH network and 64 rural counties disperse funding across a substantial population.\nImplementation Timeline: Regional grant applications opening March 2026 with October awards creates compressed timelines for coalition formation and program design. Regions lacking existing collaborative structures face disadvantage.\nThe 2030 Question Indiana’s GROW framework emphasizes sustainability, but fundamental questions remain:\nCan regional coalitions develop revenue models that survive federal funding termination?\nWill workforce recruited through RHTP incentives remain in rural communities after initial service commitments expire?\nDoes HIE infrastructure create permanent capacity or ongoing operating expenses requiring continued federal support?\nCritical dependency: Indiana’s sustainability prospects hinge substantially on Medicaid policy decisions. If work requirements generate coverage losses approaching the 180,000 enrollees affected when Arkansas implemented similar policies, transformation investments serve populations that shrink rather than stabilize.\nThe Medicaid Math Indiana faces particularly complex interaction between RHTP investment and Medicaid trajectory:\nFactor Impact RHTP Five-Year Investment +$1 billion HIP Current Enrollment 680,000+ Work Requirement Coverage Risk Unknown (potentially significant) Federal FMAP Reduction Risk Per-capita cap proposals The state’s HIP program costs Indiana relatively little from general funds because hospital assessment fees and cigarette taxes cover the 10% state share. But if federal per-capita caps or FMAP reductions shift costs to states, the financing structure that makes HIP sustainable could collapse.\nRHTP cannot offset coverage losses of the magnitude that aggressive enrollment management or federal funding changes might generate. The $207 million annual investment represents approximately $300 per currently enrolled HIP member, far less than annual coverage costs.\nConclusion Indiana’s $207 million FY2026 award validates a well-crafted application that leverages Governor Braun’s existing rural health commitment and builds on established CAH and public health infrastructure. The GROW framework addresses workforce, chronic disease, technology, and regional collaboration through initiatives that reinforce rather than duplicate each other.\nThe regional grant approach represents both strength and risk. Empowering local coalitions to determine priorities honors the reality that rural healthcare needs vary across Indiana’s 64 rural counties. But it also means that some regions will transform faster and more completely than others, creating equity concerns within a program designed to address rural disparities.\nFor Indiana’s 1.4 million rural residents, RHTP represents unprecedented federal commitment delivered through a state that has demonstrated policy interest in rural health. Whether that commitment proves sufficient depends on Medicaid policy decisions that could either complement transformation or undermine its foundation.\nThe 35 Critical Access Hospitals that anchor rural Indiana will receive network-wide support through FLEX Program coordination and HIE integration. Whether those facilities can translate RHTP investments into sustainable operations beyond 2030 depends less on the quality of GROW initiatives than on whether Hoosiers retain coverage to access the care those facilities provide.\nIndiana has a plan built on regional flexibility, infrastructure investment, and existing state commitment. The question is whether policy choices unrelated to RHTP will determine outcomes more than the transformation investments themselves.\nCross-References RHTP 2A: RHTP Structure and Rules RHTP 2B: Medicaid Architecture and the $911B Question RHTP 2H: The 2030 Cliff RHTP 4B: Workforce Recruitment and Retention RHTP 4D: Community Health Workers RHTP 4H: Social Needs Integration RHTP 3.IA: Iowa (regional comparison) RHTP 3.OH: Ohio (regional comparison, Appalachian overlap) RHTP 3.MI: Michigan (regional comparison) RHTP 3.KY: Kentucky (regional comparison) Sources Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. “CMS Announces $50 Billion in Awards to Strengthen Rural Health in All 50 States.” CMS Newsroom, 29 Dec. 2025, www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-announces-50-billion-awards-strengthen-rural-health-all-50-states.\nGovernor Mike Braun. “Gov.

</div>

<p>Indiana received <strong>$207 million in FY2026 RHTP funding</strong>, exceeding the $200 million the state requested in its November 2025 application. Governor Mike Braun called the award &ldquo;an incredible opportunity&rdquo; to ensure rural Hoosiers have &ldquo;the same opportunities to thrive as their urban neighbors.&rdquo; The program, branded <strong>GROW (Growing Rural Opportunities for Well-being): Cultivating Rural Health</strong>, reflects both the agricultural metaphor central to the state&rsquo;s identity and the governor&rsquo;s Make Rural Indiana Healthy Again initiative.</p>
<p>The five-year projected total of <strong>approximately $1 billion</strong> arrives at a critical moment. Indiana operates 52 rural hospitals, with 25% having already cut services according to the Centers for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform. The state&rsquo;s 35 Critical Access Hospitals anchor healthcare delivery across 64 rural counties, serving a population that experiences higher rates of chronic disease, fewer local specialists, and repeated closures of maternity and emergency services.</p>
<p>Yet RHTP investment coincides with Indiana&rsquo;s controversial HIP (Healthy Indiana Plan) overhaul, which reintroduces work reporting requirements and creates enrollment pressures on the very Medicaid expansion population that rural providers depend upon for revenue. <strong>The $207 million annual investment cannot offset the coverage losses that policy changes may generate.</strong></p>

<p>Indiana spans <strong>36,420 square miles</strong> across 92 counties, with approximately <strong>1.4 million rural residents</strong> comprising roughly 30% of the state&rsquo;s 6.8 million population. The Indiana Rural Health Association classifies 64 of 92 counties as rural, representing roughly two-thirds of the state&rsquo;s geography but concentrating populations in agricultural communities that define the state&rsquo;s character.</p>

<p><strong>Sixty-seven of Indiana&rsquo;s 92 counties</strong> hold Medically Underserved Area or Population designations from the Indiana State Department of Health. This figure exceeds the rural county count, indicating that workforce shortages and access limitations extend into semi-urban communities surrounding metropolitan areas like Indianapolis, Fort Wayne, and Evansville.</p>
<p>Indiana&rsquo;s rural character differs from frontier states. Communities are not isolated by hundreds of miles of empty territory. Instead, they face the paradox of proximity: close enough to urban centers that specialty services concentrate there, yet far enough that access requires substantial travel for populations that are older, poorer, and sicker than their urban counterparts. <strong>Eighteen percent of rural Indiana residents are over 65</strong>, compared to 15% in urban areas.</p>

<p>The <strong>35 Critical Access Hospitals</strong> operate across 34 counties, providing the only local hospital care for communities where alternatives lie 35 or more miles distant. The Indiana Hospital Association notes that the CAH map reveals troubling gaps: multiple rural counties have no acute care hospital at all, while others lack obstetric services entirely.</p>
<p>Indiana CAHs recognized for performance include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Decatur County Memorial Hospital</strong> (Greencastle): 2022 Chartis Top 100</li>
<li><strong>Perry County Memorial Hospital</strong> (Tell City): Achieved $5 million financial turnaround</li>
<li><strong>Union Hospital Clinton</strong>: 2022 Community Impact Award</li>
<li><strong>Greene County General Hospital</strong>: 2024 Patient Experience Award</li>
</ul>
<p>The Indiana Rural Health Association coordinates FLEX Program support for all 35 CAHs, providing educational programs focused on leadership, quality improvement, and hospital operations. This infrastructure positions Indiana to leverage RHTP investment through existing technical assistance capacity.</p>

<p><strong>Eighty-three of 92 counties</strong> lack adequate mental health providers, making behavioral health the most severe shortage category. The state ranks in the bottom 20% nationally for general pediatricians per 100,000 children, with developmental specialists facing multi-month waiting lists that rural families cannot easily navigate.</p>
<p>A 2025 rural community health survey conducted for the RHTP application drew more than 2,100 responses identifying top concerns: long travel times to care, lack of specialty access, difficulty managing chronic conditions, and limited behavioral health services. <strong>Sixty percent of Indiana&rsquo;s population lives in designated Health Professional Shortage Areas</strong>, a figure that exceeds what rural population percentages alone would predict.</p>
<h3 id="agricultural-economy-context">Agricultural Economy Context<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#agricultural-economy-context">#</a></h3>
<p>Indiana&rsquo;s economic structure creates distinct health challenges. The state&rsquo;s agricultural economy, centered on corn, soybeans, and livestock production, generates employment but carries occupational hazards. Agricultural workers face exposure to chemicals, machinery accidents, respiratory conditions from grain dust and confined animal operations, and mental health stresses from economic uncertainty and weather dependence.</p>
<p>The Indiana Rural Health Association notes that rural communities rely heavily on agriculture, farming, and natural resources, creating risks that compound health vulnerabilities. Seasonal employment variations create insurance coverage gaps, while isolated work conditions contribute to injury rates 40% higher than urban areas.</p>
<p>Median household income stands at approximately $62,000, below national averages, with rural counties showing significantly lower income levels than urban counterparts. The state&rsquo;s 10.99% poverty rate concentrates in rural communities where limited transportation options compound economic disadvantage.</p>

<p>Indiana&rsquo;s above-average award reflects multiple formula factors working in the state&rsquo;s favor. The application emphasized chronic disease management, behavioral health, and regional collaboration, aligning with CMS priorities. Governor Braun&rsquo;s existing Make Rural Indiana Healthy Again initiative provided a framework that reviewers could evaluate against demonstrated state commitment.</p>
<h3 id="formula-position">Formula Position<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#formula-position">#</a></h3>
<p>Indiana benefits modestly from RHTP&rsquo;s allocation structure:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>50% equal distribution:</strong> $100 million baseline regardless of rural population</li>
<li><strong>50% workload factors:</strong> $107 million based on rurality metrics and application scoring</li>
</ul>
<p>The $107 million workload allocation positions Indiana slightly above median. At <strong>$148 per rural resident</strong>, Indiana receives less per-capita than frontier states like Montana or Wyoming (exceeding $300 per rural resident) but more than large rural population states like Texas ($60 per rural resident).</p>
<h3 id="medicaid-expansion-status">Medicaid Expansion Status<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#medicaid-expansion-status">#</a></h3>
<p>Indiana expanded Medicaid through the <strong>Healthy Indiana Plan (HIP 2.0)</strong> beginning in February 2015, making it one of the later expansion states among those that ultimately adopted the ACA provisions. Unlike standard expansion, HIP 2.0 operates through Section 1115 waiver authority with state-specific modifications including POWER account contributions and tiered benefit structures.</p>
<p><strong>Current HIP enrollment exceeds 680,000 Hoosiers</strong>, representing the primary coverage mechanism for many rural residents. The 90% federal match for expansion populations makes HIP fiscally advantageous for the state, with Indiana&rsquo;s share covered through hospital assessment fees and cigarette taxes rather than general fund appropriations.</p>
<p>However, the 2025 legislative session passed <strong>Senate Enrolled Act 2</strong>, which reintroduces previously halted work reporting requirements and creates mechanisms to limit enrollment based on available appropriations. While explicit enrollment caps were removed, the bill&rsquo;s structure allows the FSSA secretary to restrict enrollment if funding sources prove insufficient.</p>

<h3 id="governance-and-lead-agencies">Governance and Lead Agencies<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#governance-and-lead-agencies">#</a></h3>
<p>Indiana designated a <strong>collaborative leadership structure</strong> with the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration (FSSA) and the Indiana Department of Health (IDOH) serving as joint lead agencies under Governor Braun&rsquo;s direction. The RHTP Working Group includes:</p>
<p><strong>Executive Oversight:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Mitch Roob, Secretary, FSSA</li>
<li>Lindsay Weaver, MD, State Health Commissioner, IDOH</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Partners:</strong></p>

<li>Indiana Rural Health Association (implementation support)</li>
<li>Indiana Hospital Association (provider coordination)</li>
<li>CareSource Indiana (managed care perspective)</li>
<li>Purdue University (research and evaluation)</li>
</ul>
<p>This dual-agency structure recognizes that rural health transformation requires both Medicaid expertise (FSSA) and public health infrastructure (IDOH). The working group engaged stakeholders across the state through five formal sessions and informal gatherings to inform application development.</p>
<h3 id="the-grow-framework">The GROW Framework<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-grow-framework">#</a></h3>
<p>Indiana&rsquo;s application organizes 12 initiatives around five strategic goals:</p>

<ul>
<li>Comprehensive needs assessments</li>
<li>Data-sharing plans and service-delivery innovations</li>
<li>Detailed budgets with measurable health-performance objectives</li>
<li>Letters of support documenting partnerships</li>
</ul>
<p>Required outcomes include improved maternal health, reduced preventable ED visits, increased telehealth utilization, and better chronic disease control. Regions compete on population served, partnership strength, innovation evidence, sustainability plans, and service duplication reduction.</p>
<p><strong>Regional grant applications open March 2026</strong>, with awards finalized by October 2026. This timeline creates implementation pressure but allows regional coalitions time to organize.</p>

<p>The <strong>$66.5 million HIE initiative</strong> addresses a critical infrastructure gap. Indiana&rsquo;s health information exchange currently connects approximately 120 hospitals but leaves roughly <strong>700 rural facilities outside the system</strong>, creating major gaps in care coordination.</p>
<p>The initiative proposes connecting <strong>450 of those 700 facilities</strong> through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Technology adoption incentives for rural providers</li>
<li>Full integration with state HIE architecture</li>
<li>AI tools for predictive analytics and natural language processing</li>
<li>Medical error reduction through improved data sharing</li>
</ul>
<p>This investment recognizes that transformation requires information infrastructure. Rural facilities cannot participate in coordinated care models if they lack electronic connectivity to the broader system.</p>

<p>Indiana proposes launching <strong>eight rural cardiometabolic care sites</strong> statewide through collaborative care models and training programs. The <strong>$56.2 million investment</strong> targets the state&rsquo;s high rates of diabetes, hypertension, and obesity, conditions that drive chronic disease burden and healthcare costs.</p>
<p>The initiative combines primary care capacity building with specialty integration, creating sustainable treatment pathways for conditions that historically required travel to urban centers.</p>

<p>Indiana&rsquo;s application addresses social determinants through multiple mechanisms rather than standalone initiatives:</p>
<p><strong>Regional Grant Requirements:</strong> Applications must include needs assessments covering food insecurity, transportation barriers, and social isolation, issues the rural survey identified as top concerns.</p>
<p><strong>Indiana 211 Integration:</strong> FSSA&rsquo;s Indiana 211 system provides existing resource navigation infrastructure that RHTP initiatives can leverage for closed-loop referrals.</p>
<p><strong>HIE SDOH Capabilities:</strong> The health information exchange modernization includes capacity for social needs data sharing alongside clinical information.</p>
<h3 id="community-health-worker-strategy">Community Health Worker Strategy<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#community-health-worker-strategy">#</a></h3>
<p>Indiana&rsquo;s workforce initiative includes community health workers, pharmacists practicing at expanded scope, and patient navigators as part of the broader healthcare workforce development strategy. The approach embeds CHW deployment within regional coalition applications rather than creating centralized CHW programs.</p>
<p><strong>Survival Assessment:</strong> CHW components face vulnerability under partial funding scenarios. Unlike standalone initiatives with dedicated budgets, embedding CHWs in regional grants means their deployment depends on regional coalition priorities and may vary significantly across the state.</p>
<h2 id="key-subawardees">Key Subawardees<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#key-subawardees">#</a></h2>
<p>Indiana&rsquo;s regional approach means most RHTP funds will flow through competitive subawards to regional coalitions rather than direct allocation to named organizations. However, several entities hold significant implementation roles:</p>
<p><strong>Indiana Rural Health Association</strong>
Role: FLEX Program coordination, technical assistance, CAH support
RHTP Function: Implementation partner for statewide initiatives affecting Critical Access Hospitals</p>
<p><strong>Indiana Hospital Association</strong>
Role: Provider advocacy, coordination, policy engagement
RHTP Function: Convening rural hospitals, facilitating regional coalition formation</p>
<p><strong>CareSource Indiana</strong>
Role: Managed care organization serving Medicaid population
RHTP Function: Working group member, rural access expertise through Project ECHO telehealth</p>
<p><strong>Purdue University</strong>
Role: Research, evaluation, governmental relations
RHTP Function: Working group participant, potential evaluation partner</p>
<p><strong>Technology vendors</strong> for HIE modernization and AI integration will be selected through RFI/RFP processes. The state indicated vendor assessment would begin following CMS award announcement.</p>
<h2 id="assessment">Assessment<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#assessment">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="strengths">Strengths<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#strengths">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Regional Flexibility:</strong> The $600 million regional grant structure allows communities to address local priorities rather than mandating uniform statewide programs. Rural healthcare needs vary significantly between agricultural southern Indiana and manufacturing-focused northern counties.</p>
<p><strong>Existing Infrastructure:</strong> Indiana&rsquo;s CAH network, FLEX Program, and Indiana 211 system provide foundations for transformation. The state is not building from scratch but augmenting established programs.</p>
<p><strong>HIE Investment:</strong> The $66.5 million to connect 450 facilities addresses genuine interoperability gaps that limit care coordination. This infrastructure investment creates capacity for future innovation.</p>
<p><strong>Stakeholder Engagement:</strong> The RHTP Working Group process engaged hospitals, health systems, managed care plans, academics, and legislators, building coalitions that implementation requires.</p>
<p><strong>State Commitment:</strong> Governor Braun&rsquo;s Make Rural Indiana Healthy Again initiative predates RHTP, providing policy alignment between federal funding and state priorities.</p>
<h3 id="vulnerabilities">Vulnerabilities<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#vulnerabilities">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Medicaid Policy Risk:</strong> The HIP overhaul (SEA 2) reintroduces work reporting requirements that research shows lead to coverage losses even among people who meet the requirements. Building transformation infrastructure for populations that may lose coverage during the grant period inverts the program&rsquo;s logic.</p>
<p><strong>Regional Variation:</strong> The competitive regional grant structure means some areas will receive significantly more investment than others. Communities without strong coalition formation capacity may be disadvantaged regardless of health need.</p>
<p><strong>Social Care Gaps:</strong> Unlike states with dedicated SDOH initiatives, Indiana embeds social care in regional grants without specifying minimum investment levels. This approach creates inconsistency risk.</p>
<p><strong>Per-Capita Limitations:</strong> At $148 per rural resident, Indiana cannot invest as intensively per community as frontier states. The 35-CAH network and 64 rural counties disperse funding across a substantial population.</p>
<p><strong>Implementation Timeline:</strong> Regional grant applications opening March 2026 with October awards creates compressed timelines for coalition formation and program design. Regions lacking existing collaborative structures face disadvantage.</p>
<h3 id="the-2030-question">The 2030 Question<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-2030-question">#</a></h3>
<p>Indiana&rsquo;s GROW framework emphasizes sustainability, but fundamental questions remain:</p>
<p>Can regional coalitions develop revenue models that survive federal funding termination?</p>
<p>Will workforce recruited through RHTP incentives remain in rural communities after initial service commitments expire?</p>
<p>Does HIE infrastructure create permanent capacity or ongoing operating expenses requiring continued federal support?</p>
<p><strong>Critical dependency:</strong> Indiana&rsquo;s sustainability prospects hinge substantially on Medicaid policy decisions. If work requirements generate coverage losses approaching the 180,000 enrollees affected when Arkansas implemented similar policies, transformation investments serve populations that shrink rather than stabilize.</p>

<p>The state&rsquo;s HIP program costs Indiana relatively little from general funds because hospital assessment fees and cigarette taxes cover the 10% state share. But if federal per-capita caps or FMAP reductions shift costs to states, the financing structure that makes HIP sustainable could collapse.</p>
<p><strong>RHTP cannot offset coverage losses</strong> of the magnitude that aggressive enrollment management or federal funding changes might generate. The $207 million annual investment represents approximately $300 per currently enrolled HIP member, far less than annual coverage costs.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>Indiana&rsquo;s $207 million FY2026 award validates a well-crafted application that leverages Governor Braun&rsquo;s existing rural health commitment and builds on established CAH and public health infrastructure. The <strong>GROW framework</strong> addresses workforce, chronic disease, technology, and regional collaboration through initiatives that reinforce rather than duplicate each other.</p>
<p>The regional grant approach represents both strength and risk. Empowering local coalitions to determine priorities honors the reality that rural healthcare needs vary across Indiana&rsquo;s 64 rural counties. But it also means that some regions will transform faster and more completely than others, creating equity concerns within a program designed to address rural disparities.</p>
<p>For Indiana&rsquo;s 1.4 million rural residents, RHTP represents unprecedented federal commitment delivered through a state that has demonstrated policy interest in rural health. <strong>Whether that commitment proves sufficient depends on Medicaid policy decisions that could either complement transformation or undermine its foundation.</strong></p>
<p>The 35 Critical Access Hospitals that anchor rural Indiana will receive network-wide support through FLEX Program coordination and HIE integration. Whether those facilities can translate RHTP investments into sustainable operations beyond 2030 depends less on the quality of GROW initiatives than on whether Hoosiers retain coverage to access the care those facilities provide.</p>
<p>Indiana has a plan built on regional flexibility, infrastructure investment, and existing state commitment. The question is whether policy choices unrelated to RHTP will determine outcomes more than the transformation investments themselves.</p>
