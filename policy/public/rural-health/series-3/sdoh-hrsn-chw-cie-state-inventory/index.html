  "articleBody": "is_summary: true Rural Health Transformation Project Version 13: January 2026\nPurpose This technical document provides cross-cutting inventory of social care integration across all 50 states under the Rural Health Transformation Program. The document serves three functions:\nInventory what states proposed for SDOH screening, HRSN navigation, CHW deployment, and CIE platforms Assess what survived partial funding decisions and implementation prioritization Track implementation status across key social care infrastructure categories Social care components rank among the most vulnerable RHTP elements. Rural hospital CEOs consistently rank social determinants work around 15th on priority lists, behind workforce, technology, and operational concerns. This document tracks which states protected social care investment and which allowed these components to erode under budget pressure.\nRelated Documents:\n3-TD-E-Regional: Detailed state-by-state analysis organized by region GGH_CIE_Market_Assessment: Vendor landscape and market opportunity analysis Analytical Framework Key Definitions\nSDOH (Social Determinants of Health): The conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live, and age that shape health outcomes. Includes economic stability, education, social and community context, health care access, and neighborhood/built environment.\nHRSN (Health-Related Social Needs): The individual-level social needs affecting a patient’s health, such as food insecurity, housing instability, transportation barriers, and utility difficulties. HRSN work involves screening for these needs and connecting patients to resources.\nCHW (Community Health Worker): A frontline public health worker who is a trusted member of the community served. CHWs serve as liaisons between health services and the community, providing culturally appropriate health education, informal counseling, social support, and advocacy.\nCIE (Community Information Exchange): A network of multidisciplinary organizations that use a shared technology platform to collaborate on social care referrals. CIE enables closed-loop referrals where the outcome of a referral is tracked and reported back to the referring organization.\nAssessment Categories\nCategory Definition Funded Social care components clearly preserved with dedicated budget lines Partial Some components funded, others reduced or deprioritized At Risk Included in application but vulnerable to implementation cuts Cut Explicitly removed or defunded post-award Embedded Social care included within other initiatives without dedicated funding Unknown Insufficient public documentation to assess Section 1: SDOH/HRSN Initiative Inventory Priority States: Detailed Assessment State SDOH Screening HRSN Navigation Integration Model Funding Allocated Status Texas MCO-specific (no mandate) MCO-driven (fragmented) MCO-fragmented Unknown Partial California Yes (CalAIM MCP-mandated) Yes (ECM Lead Care Manager) MCP-integrated CalAIM billions Funded Mississippi Unknown Implicit in CRIS Hub-based (clinical focus) Unknown At Risk Ohio Limited Limited Pathways HUB model (regional) Unknown Partial Georgia Not funded Not funded None None Cut Tennessee Yes Yes (LHD Navigators) Platform-mediated (TN Community Compass) ~$20-25M Funded Kentucky Yes Yes (Chronic Care Hubs) Hub-based + 1115 HRSN ~$15-20M Funded Alabama Embedded in CRIS Embedded Hub-based (clinical focus) Unknown At Risk Arkansas Not specified Embedded in CINs CIN-embedded Unknown At Risk North Carolina Yes Yes (Hubs + NCCARE360) Platform-mediated (HOP ending) ~$20-30M At Risk Oklahoma Not mandated Limited (managed care transition) Emerging MCO-driven Unknown At Risk West Virginia Yes Yes (CHW expansion) CHW-based + Connected Care Grid ~$10-15M Funded Standard States: Summary Assessment State SDOH Component Integration Model Status Arizona Yes (WPCI) Platform (CommunityCares) Funded Alaska No (BH only) None At Risk Colorado Limited (prevention) Developing (CoSHIE) Partial Connecticut Yes (Unite Connecticut) Platform-mediated (multi-sponsor) Partial Delaware Yes (provider-level) Platform-mediated (Unite Us) Partial Florida Implicit (care coordination) Platform-mediated (Unite Florida) At Risk Hawaii Limited (pilot only) MCO-mediated Partial Idaho Unknown Unknown Unknown Illinois Yes (1115 HRSN) Platform + MCO Funded Indiana No (HIP 2.0 only) None Partial Iowa Yes (Communities of Care) Co-location sites At Risk Kansas Yes (CHW-based) CHW + Regional CIE Partial Louisiana Embedded (care navigation) Care navigation with CHW Moderate Maine Yes (ME CIE ecosystem) Platform-mediated (developing) Partial Maryland Yes (CRISP) HIE-integrated tools Partial Massachusetts Yes (MCO/ACO-required) ACO + Community Partners Partial Michigan Yes (ILOS) MCO + distributed Funded Minnesota No (advocacy pending) MCO-sponsored CIE Partial Missouri No None At Risk Montana Limited CONNECT (NobleSG) At Risk Nebraska Yes (Food as Medicine) Platform (Unite NE) Partial Nevada No None Partial New Hampshire Implicit only Provider-level At Risk New Jersey Yes (1115 framework) Regional Health Hub Partial New Mexico Yes (collaborative) Platform (Findhelp) Funded New York Yes (SCN program) Platform + Regional Network Funded North Dakota Limited (wellness) Wellness/Prevention At Risk Oregon Yes CCO-mediated Funded Pennsylvania Yes (PA Navigate) Platform-mediated (Findhelp) Funded Rhode Island Yes (AE model) Platform-mediated (Unite Us) Funded South Carolina Via mobile units only Mobile-based (Clemson model) At Risk South Dakota Limited (telehealth) Telehealth focus Partial Utah Unknown Unknown Unknown Vermont Yes (Blueprint) Platform-mediated (planned) Funded Virginia Unknown Unknown Unknown Washington Yes (1115 HRSN approved) Platform-mediated (developing) Funded Wisconsin Yes CIE + CHW + Tech Funded Wyoming Unknown Unknown Unknown Integration Model Categories Model Description States Platform-mediated CIE technology drives referrals between clinical and social services NC, TN, OR, NY, VT (planned), WA (developing), AZ, NM, PA, RI, CT, ME (developing), NE, ND, SD, FL, LA (partial) Hub-based Regional hubs coordinate social care within defined geographies KY, AL, MS, NJ, OH (Pathways HUBs) Managed care-based MCOs contract for SDOH services;

Texas demonstrates fragmented CIE landscape with Findhelp and Unite Us regional deployments but no statewide coordination despite having nation’s largest rural population (4.96M). Oklahoma shows near-greenfield opportunity with minimal Unite Oklahoma presence and 2024 SPA approval creating CHW services pathway. California operates in fundamentally different paradigm where CalAIM MCP integration closes traditional CIE market.\nDeep South Priority Region CIE Status (Updated January 29, 2026) State Platform Vendor Coverage RHTP Funded Notes Mississippi None N/A 0% No No CIE infrastructure identified Tennessee Statewide Findhelp (TN Community Compass) Statewide (MCO-driven) No (predates) Since 2015; MCO partnerships established Georgia None N/A 0% Explicitly excluded Social care absent from RHTP application North Carolina Statewide Unite Us (NCCARE360) All 100 counties Provider connectivity HOP discontinuation threatens services Regional Context: Deep South states show binary CIE market structure. Tennessee and North Carolina have mature statewide platforms with MCO integration creating significant market barriers. Mississippi and Georgia have zero CIE infrastructure, representing the highest GGH opportunity in the region. Non-expansion status correlates with social care deprioritization.\nAppalachian Priority Region CIE Status (Updated January 29, 2026) State Platform Vendor Coverage RHTP Funded Notes Ohio Pathways HUBs (regional) 12 certified hubs 70+ counties (fragmented) No No statewide platform, regional hubs only Kentucky None statewide N/A 0% No No statewide CIE; KHIE transitioning to CRISP West Virginia findhelp (single system) WVU Medicine only Single system No Near-greenfield opportunity Regional Context: Appalachian states share robust CHW infrastructure without statewide CIE platforms. Ohio’s Pathways HUB model operates through 12 regional hubs but lacks interoperability. Kentucky’s 30-year Homeplace program demonstrates CHW effectiveness without platform coordination. West Virginia’s CHERP training pipeline produces CHWs without platform enablement.\nSoutheast Region CIE Status (Updated January 29, 2026) State Platform Vendor Coverage RHTP Funded Notes Alabama None N/A 0% No No CIE infrastructure identified Arkansas None statewide N/A 0% No 211 only, no closed-loop referrals Florida Unite Florida Unite Us Statewide (MCO-driven) No (predates) Community Care Plan partnership March 2025 Louisiana Unite Louisiana Unite Us Partial (14+ parishes) Under consideration MCO partnerships established South Carolina Unite South Carolina Unite Us Regional (28 counties) No United Way partnership October 2022 Plains Region CIE Status (Updated January 29, 2026) State Platform Vendor Coverage RHTP Funded Notes Kansas Regional Findhelp KC metro area No 22+ Findhelp customers statewide Nebraska Unite Nebraska Unite Us Statewide No (predates) NeHII partnership June 2020 North Dakota Unite ND Unite Us Statewide No (predates) NeHII expansion October 2020 South Dakota Unite SD Unite Us Statewide No (predates) NeHII expansion October 2020 CHW Program Status Summary Program Status States SPA with Medicaid reimbursement MN, IN, AZ, NY, MI, NM, WA, WI, NV, RI, KS, SD, LA, AR, OK (2024 SPA) SPA approved, delayed CO (2028) SPA pending (directed by legislation) MS (HB 1401 directs SPA development) Legislation mandate enacted (2024-2025) CT, NH, MS (HB 1401) Certification ready, SPA pending ND Distinct initiative funded TX, TN, NC, WI, NY Certification established, MCO-only reimbursement OH (maternal only), KY (contracts), WV (maternal/SUD only) Certification mandatory, limited Medicaid TX (DSHS since 2001, HB 113/HB 1575 specific populations only) Certification, no direct reimbursement MA, MO, PA, MD, NE, FL, SC Benefit active, certification paused CA (Medi-Cal benefit July 2022, HCAI cert paused Nov 2023) Pilot or in development NJ, HI, IL Embedded in other initiatives IA, VT, ME, DE Limited/tribal only MT No state certification, SPA approved OK (C3 framework, 2024 SPA) No certification or reimbursement AL, GA Separate workforce (CHA/P) AK Section 4: Regional Summary Tables South Central/Western Priority Region Summary (Batch 9 Complete Research) State CIE Status CHW Status SDOH/HRSN TD-E GGH CIE Gap TX Fragmented Regional (Findhelp/Unite Us) Mandatory cert (DSHS, 49 programs), limited Medicaid (HB 113/1575) MCO-fragmented Partial MODERATE-HIGH OK Limited (Unite Oklahoma) No cert, 2024 SPA approved (C3 framework) Emerging MCO Emerging MODERATE CA CalAIM/MCP-integrated Paused cert (HCAI), Medi-Cal benefit active ($31.74/30min) Funded (CalAIM) Funded LOW Key South Central/Western Findings:\nTexas presents highest GGH opportunity in Batch 9: no statewide CIE despite Findhelp/Unite Us regional presence, mature mandatory CHW certification (2001) with 49 training programs but limited Medicaid reimbursement (HB 113/HB 1575 specific populations only), largest rural population nationally (4.96M)\nOklahoma represents emerging opportunity: 2024 SPA approval for CHW Medicaid reimbursement without certification requirement creates services pathway, minimal CIE infrastructure (Unite Oklahoma limited scale), managed care transition creating implementation uncertainty\nCalifornia presents lowest opportunity in Batch 9: CalAIM MCP integration effectively closes platform market, CHW certification paused (Nov 2023) despite active Medi-Cal benefit constrains workforce growth, PATH funding ($1.84B) already targeting rural areas\nRegional pattern: Non-expansion status (TX, OK) correlates with MCO-fragmented SDOH approaches. Expansion status (CA) enables comprehensive transformation but saturates market.\nDeep South Priority Region Summary (Batch 7 Complete Research) State CIE Status CHW Status SDOH/HRSN TD-E GGH CIE Gap MS None Emerging (HB 1401, 2025) At Risk Partial CRITICAL TN Statewide (Findhelp) Voluntary (TNCHWA) At Risk Moderate LOW GA None Pending (HB 291) Cut Cut CRITICAL NC Statewide (Unite Us/NCCARE360) MCO-integrated At Risk (HOP ending) At Risk LOW Key Deep South Findings:\nMississippi represents highest GGH opportunity in Deep South: no CIE platform, emerging CHW Medicaid pathway (HB 1401, 2025) creates certification and directs SPA development, Delta Region strategic alignment\nGeorgia represents critical CIE opportunity: no CIE platform, social care explicitly excluded from RHTP application despite having region’s worst coverage gap (175,000+ in partial Pathways expansion, only ~6,500 enrolled)\nTennessee has mature statewide CIE (TN Community Compass/Findhelp since 2015) but no CHW Medicaid reimbursement, creating low platform opportunity but CHW services gap\nNorth Carolina has nation-leading CIE deployment (NCCARE360/Unite Us in all 100 counties) with MCO-integrated CHW model but faces HOP discontinuation threatening service delivery funding\nAppalachian Priority Region Summary (Batch 8 Complete Research) State CIE Status CHW Status SDOH/HRSN TD-E GGH CIE Gap OH Pathways HUBs (regional, 70+ counties) Cert (OBN, 2003), MCO maternal only Partial Partial MODERATE KY None statewide Cert (OCHW), MCO contracts 1115 HRSN approved (TEAMKY) Funded MODERATE WV findhelp (WVU only) Training (CHERP), MCO maternal/SUD Limited Partial MODERATE-HIGH Key Appalachian Findings:\nWest Virginia represents highest Appalachian GGH opportunity: near-greenfield CIE (findhelp at WVU only), highest per-capita RHTP funding nationally ($574/rural resident), CHERP training pipeline produces CHWs without platform enablement\nOhio demonstrates nation’s most developed Pathways HUB network (12 certified hubs, 70+ counties) but no interoperability between hubs and no statewide CIE, creating federated platform opportunity\nKentucky has 1115 HRSN waiver approved (TEAMKY) with recuperative care pilot and recovery residence support but no statewide CIE, creating immediate coordination needs\nRegional pattern: All three states have robust CHW infrastructure without sustainable financing.

<h2 id="purpose">Purpose<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#purpose">#</a></h2>
<p>This technical document provides <strong>cross-cutting inventory of social care integration</strong> across all 50 states under the Rural Health Transformation Program. The document serves three functions:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Inventory what states proposed</strong> for SDOH screening, HRSN navigation, CHW deployment, and CIE platforms</li>
<li><strong>Assess what survived</strong> partial funding decisions and implementation prioritization</li>
<li><strong>Track implementation status</strong> across key social care infrastructure categories</li>
</ol>
<p>Social care components rank among the <strong>most vulnerable RHTP elements</strong>. Rural hospital CEOs consistently rank social determinants work around 15th on priority lists, behind workforce, technology, and operational concerns. This document tracks which states protected social care investment and which allowed these components to erode under budget pressure.</p>

<p><strong>Key Definitions</strong></p>
<p><strong>SDOH (Social Determinants of Health):</strong> The conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live, and age that shape health outcomes. Includes economic stability, education, social and community context, health care access, and neighborhood/built environment.</p>
<p><strong>HRSN (Health-Related Social Needs):</strong> The individual-level social needs affecting a patient&rsquo;s health, such as food insecurity, housing instability, transportation barriers, and utility difficulties. HRSN work involves screening for these needs and connecting patients to resources.</p>
<p><strong>CHW (Community Health Worker):</strong> A frontline public health worker who is a trusted member of the community served. CHWs serve as liaisons between health services and the community, providing culturally appropriate health education, informal counseling, social support, and advocacy.</p>
<p><strong>CIE (Community Information Exchange):</strong> A network of multidisciplinary organizations that use a shared technology platform to collaborate on social care referrals. CIE enables closed-loop referrals where the outcome of a referral is tracked and reported back to the referring organization.</p>

<p><strong>Regional Context:</strong> South Central/Western states present <strong>dramatically different paradigms</strong>.

Oklahoma shows <strong>near-greenfield opportunity</strong> with minimal Unite Oklahoma presence and 2024 SPA approval creating CHW services pathway. California operates in <strong>fundamentally different paradigm</strong> where CalAIM MCP integration closes traditional CIE market.</p>

<p><strong>Regional Context:</strong> Deep South states show <strong>binary CIE market structure</strong>. Tennessee and North Carolina have mature statewide platforms with MCO integration creating significant market barriers. Mississippi and Georgia have <strong>zero CIE infrastructure</strong>, representing the highest GGH opportunity in the region. Non-expansion status correlates with social care deprioritization.</p>

<p><strong>Regional Context:</strong> Appalachian states share <strong>robust CHW infrastructure without statewide CIE platforms</strong>.

<p><strong>Key South Central/Western Findings:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Texas</strong> presents <strong>highest GGH opportunity</strong> in Batch 9: no statewide CIE despite Findhelp/Unite Us regional presence, <strong>mature mandatory CHW certification (2001)</strong> with 49 training programs but <strong>limited Medicaid reimbursement</strong> (HB 113/HB 1575 specific populations only), largest rural population nationally (4.96M)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Oklahoma</strong> represents <strong>emerging opportunity</strong>: 2024 SPA approval for CHW Medicaid reimbursement without certification requirement creates services pathway, minimal CIE infrastructure (Unite Oklahoma limited scale), managed care transition creating implementation uncertainty</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>California</strong> presents <strong>lowest opportunity</strong> in Batch 9: CalAIM MCP integration effectively closes platform market, CHW certification paused (Nov 2023) despite active Medi-Cal benefit constrains workforce growth, PATH funding ($1.84B) already targeting rural areas</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Regional pattern:</strong> Non-expansion status (TX, OK) correlates with MCO-fragmented SDOH approaches. Expansion status (CA) enables comprehensive transformation but saturates market.</p>

<p><strong>Key Deep South Findings:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Mississippi</strong> represents <strong>highest GGH opportunity</strong> in Deep South: no CIE platform, <strong>emerging CHW Medicaid pathway (HB 1401, 2025)</strong> creates certification and directs SPA development, Delta Region strategic alignment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Georgia</strong> represents <strong>critical CIE opportunity</strong>: no CIE platform, <strong>social care explicitly excluded</strong> from RHTP application despite having region&rsquo;s worst coverage gap (175,000+ in partial Pathways expansion, only ~6,500 enrolled)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tennessee</strong> has <strong>mature statewide CIE</strong> (TN Community Compass/Findhelp since 2015) but <strong>no CHW Medicaid reimbursement</strong>, creating low platform opportunity but CHW services gap</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>North Carolina</strong> has <strong>nation-leading CIE deployment</strong> (NCCARE360/Unite Us in all 100 counties) with <strong>MCO-integrated CHW model</strong> but faces <strong>HOP discontinuation</strong> threatening service delivery funding</p>

<p><strong>West Virginia</strong> represents <strong>highest Appalachian GGH opportunity</strong>: near-greenfield CIE (findhelp at WVU only), <strong>highest per-capita RHTP funding nationally ($574/rural resident)</strong>, CHERP training pipeline produces CHWs without platform enablement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ohio</strong> demonstrates <strong>nation&rsquo;s most developed Pathways HUB network</strong> (12 certified hubs, 70+ counties) but <strong>no interoperability between hubs</strong> and no statewide CIE, creating federated platform opportunity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Kentucky</strong> has <strong>1115 HRSN waiver approved</strong> (TEAMKY) with recuperative care pilot and recovery residence support but <strong>no statewide CIE</strong>, creating immediate coordination needs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Regional pattern:</strong> All three states have <strong>robust CHW infrastructure without sustainable financing</strong>. MCO-mediated reimbursement limited to maternal/SUD populations excludes chronic disease management and community-based organizations.</p>
