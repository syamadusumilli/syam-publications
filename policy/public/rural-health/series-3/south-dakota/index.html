  "articleBody": "The frontier formula advantage meets the reservation paradox: favorable per capita funding confronts the nation’s most severe health disparities.\nIntroduction South Dakota’s $189.5 million FY2026 RHTP award places the state in a paradoxical position. The funding formula’s baseline allocation delivers approximately $486 per rural resident, among the highest per capita rates nationally, rivaling Alaska and Wyoming for formula advantage. This favorable position reflects the same structural bias that benefits sparsely populated states: the $100 million baseline provides substantial resources regardless of population size.\nYet South Dakota contains some of the most severe health disparities anywhere in the United States. The Pine Ridge and Rosebud reservations record life expectancy figures that rival developing nations. Indigenous South Dakotans who died between 2017 and 2021 had a median age of 58, 22 years younger than white South Dakotans. Federal prisoner healthcare funding exceeds what urban American Indians receive through the Indian Health Service.\nThe state’s RHTP approach centers on regionalization, telehealth expansion, and payment model transformation to address a rural health system where 77% of Critical Access Hospitals cluster in eastern South Dakota while western communities, including most reservation areas, face travel distances exceeding 120 miles for basic care. Whether this approach translates favorable funding into meaningful improvement for the populations experiencing the most acute health crises will determine the program’s success.\nRural Health Landscape South Dakota spans over 75,000 square miles in the upper Midwest, ranking as one of the nation’s most rural and frontier geographic areas. The Missouri River divides the state into distinct east and west regions with dramatically different healthcare access patterns. As of 2024, the state population is approximately 924,000 with an average population density of 11.7 people per square mile, roughly one-seventh the national average.\nGeographic Reality\nOf South Dakota’s 66 counties, 30 are classified as rural and 34 as frontier (fewer than 6 people per square mile). This frontier dominance creates healthcare access challenges that compound with each mile of separation from regional centers. The state’s two most populated counties, Minnehaha (Sioux Falls) and Pennington (Rapid City), anchor opposite ends of the state, leaving the interior dependent on a scattered network of small facilities.\nHealthcare Infrastructure\nFacility Type Count Distribution Critical Access Hospitals 40 77% in eastern South Dakota Rural Health Clinics 58-60 Statewide FQHCs and satellites 51 Including Horizon Health with 31 clinics IHS Hospitals 5 Only 2 with obstetric services General acute hospitals 49 total Including CAHs The concentration of Critical Access Hospitals in eastern South Dakota creates a structural access gap. Western communities, including much of the reservation territory, face travel distances up to 120 miles one-way to reach care. This geographic maldistribution shapes the state’s RHTP strategy and explains the emphasis on regionalization and mobile care delivery.\nWorkforce Shortages\nOver two-thirds of South Dakota is designated by HRSA as a Health Professional Shortage Area for primary care, dental health, and mental health. The state reports 71 Medically Underserved Areas/Populations. As of 2022, the state had 5,613 licensed physicians and 736 physician assistants, with 1,964 actively licensed nurse practitioners. These numbers, while growing, remain insufficient for the geographic coverage required.\nThe aging healthcare workforce presents compounding challenges. As baby boomers retire from healthcare positions, they simultaneously require more healthcare services. State workforce programs, including the Health Occupations for Today and Tomorrow initiative, attempt to address this pipeline problem but compete against metropolitan areas offering higher compensation and broader practice opportunities.\nThe Reservation Reality\nSouth Dakota contains nine federally recognized American Indian tribes within its borders. Native Americans comprise approximately 9% of the state population, well above the national average. Five counties lie entirely within Indian reservations, and tribal populations experience health disparities that dwarf the rural-urban gaps seen elsewhere in the state.\nPine Ridge Reservation encompasses 2.1 million acres of southwest South Dakota, home to members of the Oglala Lakota Nation. Health indicators paint a stark picture:\nLife expectancy estimates range from 52 to 67 years, depending on methodology and time period, compared to national averages above 77 years Diabetes mortality 800% higher than national average Infant mortality 300% higher than non-Native state residents Cervical cancer rates 500% higher than national average Alcoholism-related mortality 550% higher than non-Native populations Per capita income approximately $8,768 Unemployment rates approaching 89% in some communities Rosebud Reservation, 135 miles east of Pine Ridge and home to the Sicangu Sioux, faces similar challenges. Todd County, where the Rosebud IHS Hospital is located, reports average life expectancy of 67 years, more than a decade below national averages. The nearest alternative hospital is approximately 50 miles away.\nThe Indian Health Service operates five hospitals in South Dakota, but only two provide routine obstetric services. IHS facilities face chronic understaffing, and some lack basic infrastructure like advanced imaging or reliable broadband. A 2022 tragedy illustrated these limitations when 12-year-old Honor Beauvais died on the Rosebud Reservation after being evaluated at the IHS emergency room, released, and unable to receive emergency care when massive snowdrifts prevented ambulance access.\nHealth Outcomes\nThe South Dakota Department of Health reports that 50% of white South Dakotans will die before age 80, while half of all Native Americans in the state will die before age 58. This 22-year gap represents one of the largest intrastate health disparities in the nation and creates a dual-track reality where RHTP’s impact will vary dramatically by population served.\nRHTP Award and Context Award Details\nMetric Value FY2026 Allocation $189,477,607 Five-Year Projection ~$950 million Amount Requested (Year 1) $193.3 million Amount Requested (Five-Year) $1 billion Per Rural Resident ~$486 National Award Ranking Mid-tier by absolute amount Per Capita Ranking Top 5 nationally South Dakota requested $1 billion over five years, including $193.3 million for the first year. The $189.5 million award represents approximately 98% of the requested first-year amount, indicating strong CMS scoring of the state’s application. Unlike some states that received substantially less than requested, South Dakota’s proposal largely survived federal review intact.\nFormula Advantage\nSouth Dakota exemplifies the RHTP funding formula’s geographic bias. With approximately 390,000 rural residents, the state receives roughly $486 per person, nearly nine times Texas’s allocation of approximately $60 per rural resident. The formula’s $100 million baseline delivers approximately $256 per rural resident before any workload factors apply.\nThis favorable position places South Dakota among the five states where RHTP funding meets or exceeds projected Medicaid cuts under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. KFF projects federal Medicaid spending in rural South Dakota will decrease by $487 million over the next decade, primarily from new work requirements causing coverage losses. The state’s RHTP allocation approximately offsets this reduction, creating near-neutral net position.\nMedicaid Context\nSouth Dakota expanded Medicaid in July 2023 following voter approval of Constitutional Amendment D in November 2022. The citizen-led initiative required the state to provide Medicaid benefits to adults 18-65 with incomes below 138% of federal poverty level. Initial projections anticipated 52,000 enrollees; by October 2024, approximately 28,000 people had enrolled, with state officials revising expectations to approximately 40,000 by 2025.\nThe state’s Medicaid expansion history adds complexity to RHTP implementation:\nAmendment D (2022): Voters approved expansion by 56-44% Expansion effective: July 1, 2023 Amendment F (2024): Voters approved 56-44% allowing legislature to consider work requirements Work requirement status: Requires federal waiver approval; implementation uncertain The potential for Medicaid work requirements creates planning uncertainty for RHTP initiatives designed to serve low-income populations. If work requirements cause coverage losses as seen in other states, some RHTP investment in care delivery may face reduced demand even as infrastructure improves.\nState Approach Lead Agency and Governance\nThe South Dakota Department of Health serves as lead agency for RHTP implementation, with direct involvement from the Governor’s Office. Governor Larry Rhoden announced the award on December 29, 2025, emphasizing the collaborative development process.\nKey Partners\nThe state’s application development involved extensive stakeholder coordination:\nSouth Dakota Association of Healthcare Organizations (SDAHO): Represents hospital and facility interests Great Plains Tribal Leaders Health Board: Coordinates with nine tribal nations Sanford Health and Avera Health: Major regional health systems covering most of the state Monument Health: Black Hills region health system Horizon Health: FQHC network operating 31 clinics across 22 communities, including six reservations Community HealthCare Association of the Dakotas: Represents FQHCs and advocates for primary care access Strategic Framework\nThe state’s application addresses the geographic concentration problem directly, acknowledging that 77% of Critical Access Hospitals cluster in eastern South Dakota. The strategy emphasizes:\nRegionalization: Creating coordinated regional networks rather than independent facility operations Technology and Self-Monitoring: Extending care reach through telehealth and remote patient monitoring Prevention and Chronic Disease Management: Reducing emergency department utilization through upstream intervention Payment Model Transformation: Moving toward value-based care for sustainability Community Input Process\nThe Department of Health conducted statewide Community Conversations before finalizing the application. Participants identified consistent themes:\nAccess to healthcare is limited in many rural communities There are not enough healthcare workers across fields Transportation is a major barrier to receiving care Limited access to dental and behavioral health services Need for affordable, local care Proposed solutions from community input included expanding telehealth and mobile clinics, improving broadband access, supporting rural provider recruitment, and developing community-based transportation and wellness initiatives.\nProgram and Funding Distribution South Dakota’s application proposed multiple programs totaling approximately $580 million in identified initiatives over five years. The following reflects requested amounts from the state application, as actual funded levels may vary:\nProgram Allocation (Requested) Implementing Organization Focus Regional Partnership Grants $125 million Regional health systems Coordination, sustainability EMS Regionalization $64 million EMS agencies, regional hubs Response times, workforce Medicaid VBP for CAHs $62.6 million DSS, participating hospitals Payment transformation Workforce Recruitment $62.5 million DOH, facilities Sign-on bonuses, relocation CCBHC Establishment $56.4 million Behavioral health providers Mental health access Chronic Disease Management $45 million Providers, pharmacies, schools Remote monitoring, interventions Maternal Health Hubs $24 million 3 regional entities Telehealth, remote monitoring Provider Training $4.7 million Training organizations Online education, rural-specific CHW Development $3.5 million DOH, healthcare facilities Medicaid billing pathways Major Initiative Details\nRegional Partnership Grants ($125 million): The largest single initiative funds grants incentivizing South Dakota healthcare providers to explore regional assessments and partnerships. Providers can use grants to improve professional and management services affecting facility finances. The goal is sustainable regional coordination allowing hospitals and clinics to coordinate services, offer complementary care, and strengthen financial stability.\nEMS Regionalization ($64 million): Creates regional emergency medical service hubs to reduce response times, offer professional development, and improve technology. The state has already invested millions in EMS technology upgrades and issued a report on EMS sustainability recommendations. Target outcomes include improving emergency response times and increasing EMS workforce by 15% within two years.\nMedicaid Value-Based Payment ($62.6 million): Supports a new Medicaid payment model providing more predictable revenue to health care systems, rewarding quality, and allowing facilities to maintain comprehensive services in rural areas. This initiative represents the state’s primary payment transformation effort.\nWorkforce Recruitment ($62.5 million): Provides recruitment incentives including sign-on bonuses, relocation assistance, and rural service stipends. The program includes five-year sign-on commitments and expands apprenticeship programs. Target: recruit 500 rural professionals by 2030.\nCCBHC Establishment ($56.4 million): South Dakota currently has no certified community behavioral health clinics providing mental health and substance use services regardless of insurance status. This initiative would establish at least one CCBHC in each of the state’s behavioral health regions, plus mobile crisis teams and crisis stabilization facilities to reduce emergency room visits and jail holds.\nMaternal Health Hubs ($24 million): Funds analysis of maternal health gaps (service shortages, social supports, workforce needs, regulatory barriers) and then funds three healthcare entities to create regional maternal health hubs using telehealth, remote monitoring, and in-person visits to address transportation and accessibility issues in rural and tribal areas.\nSocial Care Integration Component Included in Plan Funding Vendor/Operator Likely Funded? SDOH/HRSN Embedded in wellness initiatives Not distinct line item Multiple At Risk CHW Programs Yes $3.5 million DOH, healthcare facilities Yes CIE Platform Not explicitly proposed N/A N/A No Social Determinants Assessment\nSouth Dakota’s application embeds social care considerations within clinical initiatives rather than establishing distinct SDOH programs. The Community Conversations process identified transportation, food access, and housing as significant barriers, but the resulting proposal focuses primarily on clinical access expansion through technology rather than direct social needs intervention.\nCommunity Health Worker Programs\nThe $3.5 million CHW development initiative supports growth of community health workers in the state’s healthcare system. Specific activities include:\nDeveloping Medicaid claims pathways for CHW services Creating Medicare billing pathways Supporting CHW certification and training Integrating CHWs into clinical workflows The state currently has 180 certified community health representatives, primarily serving tribal populations. The RHTP investment aims to expand CHW deployment beyond tribal settings into broader rural healthcare delivery.\nHorizon Health operates as a significant social care intermediary, with 31 clinics across 22 communities covering a 28,000 square mile service area serving nearly 30,000 patients annually. Operating on six of nine reservations, Horizon provides primary and preventive care designed to prevent more serious conditions while connecting patients requiring more intensive services to appropriate resources.\nTechnology Infrastructure Gap\nUnlike states proposing comprehensive Community Information Exchange platforms, South Dakota’s application does not explicitly include CIE deployment. The technology emphasis focuses on telehealth expansion and remote patient monitoring rather than closed-loop referral systems for social services. This represents a potential gap in the state’s social care architecture.\nKey Subawardees As of January 2026, specific subaward announcements have not been finalized. Based on application content and stated partnerships, anticipated key recipients include:\nHospital Systems\nSanford Health: Major regional system likely to receive workforce and regionalization funding Avera Health: Eastern South Dakota presence positions for multiple initiative participation Monument Health: Black Hills region system likely to participate in EMS and regional partnerships Associations and Coalitions\nSouth Dakota Association of Healthcare Organizations (SDAHO): Coordinating role across multiple initiatives Community HealthCare Association of the Dakotas: FQHC representation and CHW development Great Plains Tribal Leaders Health Board: Tribal health coordination and consultation Other Entities\nHorizon Health: FQHC network likely to receive primary care and CHW funding University of South Dakota: Potential workforce training and research partnerships South Dakota State University: Healthcare workforce pipeline programs Assessment Strengths\nFormula Advantage Creates Opportunity. South Dakota’s ~$486 per rural resident represents substantial resources relative to population. Unlike Texas or North Carolina where per-capita funding forces triage decisions, South Dakota can pursue comprehensive transformation if implementation executes effectively.\nMedicaid Expansion Foundation. The July 2023 expansion provides coverage infrastructure that RHTP investments can build upon. Approximately 28,000 new enrollees represent both patients for transformed care delivery and revenue stability for rural providers transitioning to value-based models.\nStrong Hospital Network. The state’s 40 Critical Access Hospitals have avoided the closure crisis affecting other rural states. While geographic distribution challenges exist, the network provides a foundation for regional coordination rather than starting from emergency stabilization.\nTribal Partnership Framework. Including the Great Plains Tribal Leaders Health Board in application development and explicitly addressing tribal areas in the maternal health hub initiative demonstrates awareness of where disparities are most severe. Whether this translates to proportionate resource allocation remains to be seen.\nVulnerabilities\nReservation Disconnect. The fundamental question is whether favorable state-level funding translates to meaningful improvement on reservations experiencing the most acute health crises. RHTP funds flow through the state, not directly to tribal health systems or IHS. The $3.5 million CHW investment is modest relative to the scale of reservation health disparities.\nWork Requirement Uncertainty. Amendment F’s passage authorizes (but does not implement) Medicaid work requirements. If implemented under federal waiver approval, work requirements could cause coverage losses undermining RHTP care delivery investments. States implementing work requirements have seen significant enrollment declines.\nEastern Concentration Persistence. The geographic concentration problem, with 77% of CAHs in eastern South Dakota, reflects decades of population and economic patterns unlikely to shift through five years of transformation funding. Whether regionalization and technology can adequately compensate for physical facility gaps remains unproven.\nNo CCBHC Baseline. Starting from zero certified community behavioral health clinics means the $56.4 million investment must build infrastructure, workforce, and organizational capacity simultaneously. States with existing CCBHC networks can expand; South Dakota must create.\nSustainability Prospects\nSouth Dakota’s favorable Medicaid gap position (RHTP roughly offsetting projected cuts) provides more realistic sustainability prospects than states facing massive net reductions. However, post-2030 continuation requires:\nState general fund commitment unlikely given conservative fiscal philosophy Successful transition to value-based payment generating provider revenue independent of grants Federal renewal or replacement program The value-based payment transformation initiative ($62.6 million) explicitly targets sustainability by creating payment models that reward quality rather than requiring ongoing federal subsidies. Success here determines whether other investments become permanent or experimental.\nCritical Success Factors\nTribal health proportionality: Whether reservation communities receive RHTP investment proportionate to disparity severity CCBHC establishment velocity: Building behavioral health infrastructure from zero before funding expires Work requirement resolution: Clarity on Medicaid eligibility stability for planning purposes EMS workforce achievement: Meeting 15% workforce increase target within two years Regional partnership formalization: Moving beyond grant incentives to sustainable coordination structures Conclusion South Dakota enters RHTP implementation with structural advantages unavailable to most states: favorable per-capita funding, recent Medicaid expansion, stable hospital network, and projected Medicaid cuts roughly offset by transformation investment. The state’s application demonstrates strategic awareness of geographic access challenges and proposes reasonable interventions around regionalization, workforce, and payment transformation.\nThe central question is not whether South Dakota has adequate resources, but whether those resources reach the populations experiencing the most severe disparities. Pine Ridge and Rosebud reservations contain health outcomes that would constitute emergency conditions anywhere else in the developed world. If RHTP success is measured by statewide averages improving modestly while reservation life expectancy remains decades below national norms, the program will have failed its fundamental purpose.\nWhat to Watch\nQ1-Q2 2026 subaward announcements showing geographic and population distribution of funds CCBHC site selection and timeline for behavioral health infrastructure Tribal health funding proportionality in maternal health hub and workforce initiatives EMS regionalization progress toward 15% workforce target Medicaid work requirement waiver application and CMS response under current administration South Dakota’s RHTP implementation tests whether the formula advantage creates genuine opportunity or simply delivers resources to areas that already function relatively well. The state’s trajectory over the next five years will reveal whether frontier funding benefits translate to frontier communities or bypass them entirely.\nCross-reference: Series 2A (RHTP Structure and Rules) for funding formula mechanics; Series 2E (Indian Health Service) for tribal health context; Series 10 Regional Deep Dives for reservation-specific analysis.\nRHTP 3.SD: South Dakota Rural Health Transformation Project Series 3: State Implementation Version 3: January 2026\n",

<p><em>The frontier formula advantage meets the reservation paradox: favorable per capita funding confronts the nation&rsquo;s most severe health disparities.</em></p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#introduction">#</a></h2>
<p>South Dakota&rsquo;s <strong>$189.5 million FY2026 RHTP award</strong> places the state in a paradoxical position. The funding formula&rsquo;s baseline allocation delivers approximately <strong>$486 per rural resident</strong>, among the highest per capita rates nationally, rivaling Alaska and Wyoming for formula advantage. This favorable position reflects the same structural bias that benefits sparsely populated states: the $100 million baseline provides substantial resources regardless of population size.</p>
<p>Yet South Dakota contains some of the <strong>most severe health disparities anywhere in the United States</strong>. The Pine Ridge and Rosebud reservations record life expectancy figures that rival developing nations. Indigenous South Dakotans who died between 2017 and 2021 had a median age of 58, <strong>22 years younger</strong> than white South Dakotans. Federal prisoner healthcare funding exceeds what urban American Indians receive through the Indian Health Service.</p>
<p>The state&rsquo;s RHTP approach centers on <strong>regionalization, telehealth expansion, and payment model transformation</strong> to address a rural health system where 77% of Critical Access Hospitals cluster in eastern South Dakota while western communities, including most reservation areas, face travel distances exceeding 120 miles for basic care. Whether this approach translates favorable funding into meaningful improvement for the populations experiencing the most acute health crises will determine the program&rsquo;s success.</p>
<h2 id="rural-health-landscape">Rural Health Landscape<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#rural-health-landscape">#</a></h2>
<p>South Dakota spans over <strong>75,000 square miles</strong> in the upper Midwest, ranking as one of the nation&rsquo;s most rural and frontier geographic areas. The Missouri River divides the state into distinct east and west regions with dramatically different healthcare access patterns. As of 2024, the state population is approximately <strong>924,000</strong> with an average population density of 11.7 people per square mile, roughly one-seventh the national average.</p>
<p><strong>Geographic Reality</strong></p>
<p>Of South Dakota&rsquo;s <strong>66 counties, 30 are classified as rural and 34 as frontier</strong> (fewer than 6 people per square mile). This frontier dominance creates healthcare access challenges that compound with each mile of separation from regional centers. The state&rsquo;s two most populated counties, Minnehaha (Sioux Falls) and Pennington (Rapid City), anchor opposite ends of the state, leaving the interior dependent on a scattered network of small facilities.</p>

<p>The <strong>concentration of Critical Access Hospitals in eastern South Dakota</strong> creates a structural access gap. Western communities, including much of the reservation territory, face travel distances up to 120 miles one-way to reach care. This geographic maldistribution shapes the state&rsquo;s RHTP strategy and explains the emphasis on regionalization and mobile care delivery.</p>
<p><strong>Workforce Shortages</strong></p>
<p>Over two-thirds of South Dakota is designated by HRSA as a <strong>Health Professional Shortage Area</strong> for primary care, dental health, and mental health. The state reports <strong>71 Medically Underserved Areas/Populations</strong>. As of 2022, the state had 5,613 licensed physicians and 736 physician assistants, with 1,964 actively licensed nurse practitioners. These numbers, while growing, remain insufficient for the geographic coverage required.</p>
<p>The aging healthcare workforce presents compounding challenges. As baby boomers retire from healthcare positions, they simultaneously require more healthcare services. State workforce programs, including the Health Occupations for Today and Tomorrow initiative, attempt to address this pipeline problem but compete against metropolitan areas offering higher compensation and broader practice opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>The Reservation Reality</strong></p>
<p>South Dakota contains <strong>nine federally recognized American Indian tribes</strong> within its borders. Native Americans comprise approximately <strong>9% of the state population</strong>, well above the national average. Five counties lie entirely within Indian reservations, and tribal populations experience health disparities that dwarf the rural-urban gaps seen elsewhere in the state.</p>
<p><strong>Pine Ridge Reservation</strong> encompasses 2.1 million acres of southwest South Dakota, home to members of the Oglala Lakota Nation. Health indicators paint a stark picture:</p>
<ul>
<li>Life expectancy estimates range from 52 to 67 years, depending on methodology and time period, compared to national averages above 77 years</li>
<li>Diabetes mortality <strong>800% higher</strong> than national average</li>
<li>Infant mortality <strong>300% higher</strong> than non-Native state residents</li>
<li>Cervical cancer rates <strong>500% higher</strong> than national average</li>
<li>Alcoholism-related mortality <strong>550% higher</strong> than non-Native populations</li>
<li>Per capita income approximately $8,768</li>
<li>Unemployment rates approaching 89% in some communities</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rosebud Reservation</strong>, 135 miles east of Pine Ridge and home to the Sicangu Sioux, faces similar challenges. Todd County, where the Rosebud IHS Hospital is located, reports average life expectancy of 67 years, more than a decade below national averages. The nearest alternative hospital is approximately 50 miles away.</p>
<p>The <strong>Indian Health Service</strong> operates five hospitals in South Dakota, but only two provide routine obstetric services. IHS facilities face chronic understaffing, and some lack basic infrastructure like advanced imaging or reliable broadband. A 2022 tragedy illustrated these limitations when 12-year-old Honor Beauvais died on the Rosebud Reservation after being evaluated at the IHS emergency room, released, and unable to receive emergency care when massive snowdrifts prevented ambulance access.</p>
<p><strong>Health Outcomes</strong></p>
<p>The South Dakota Department of Health reports that <strong>50% of white South Dakotans will die before age 80</strong>, while <strong>half of all Native Americans in the state will die before age 58</strong>. This 22-year gap represents one of the largest intrastate health disparities in the nation and creates a dual-track reality where RHTP&rsquo;s impact will vary dramatically by population served.</p>

<p>South Dakota requested <strong>$1 billion over five years</strong>, including $193.3 million for the first year. The <strong>$189.5 million award</strong> represents approximately 98% of the requested first-year amount, indicating strong CMS scoring of the state&rsquo;s application. Unlike some states that received substantially less than requested, South Dakota&rsquo;s proposal largely survived federal review intact.</p>
<p><strong>Formula Advantage</strong></p>
<p>South Dakota exemplifies the RHTP funding formula&rsquo;s geographic bias. With approximately <strong>390,000 rural residents</strong>, the state receives roughly $486 per person, <strong>nearly nine times Texas&rsquo;s allocation</strong> of approximately $60 per rural resident. The formula&rsquo;s $100 million baseline delivers approximately $256 per rural resident before any workload factors apply.</p>
<p>This favorable position places South Dakota among the <strong>five states where RHTP funding meets or exceeds projected Medicaid cuts</strong> under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. KFF projects federal Medicaid spending in rural South Dakota will decrease by <strong>$487 million over the next decade</strong>, primarily from new work requirements causing coverage losses. The state&rsquo;s RHTP allocation approximately offsets this reduction, creating near-neutral net position.</p>
<p><strong>Medicaid Context</strong></p>
<p>South Dakota <strong>expanded Medicaid in July 2023</strong> following voter approval of Constitutional Amendment D in November 2022. The citizen-led initiative required the state to provide Medicaid benefits to adults 18-65 with incomes below 138% of federal poverty level. Initial projections anticipated 52,000 enrollees; by October 2024, approximately <strong>28,000 people had enrolled</strong>, with state officials revising expectations to approximately 40,000 by 2025.</p>
<p>The state&rsquo;s Medicaid expansion history adds complexity to RHTP implementation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Amendment D (2022)</strong>: Voters approved expansion by 56-44%</li>
<li><strong>Expansion effective</strong>: July 1, 2023</li>
<li><strong>Amendment F (2024)</strong>: Voters approved 56-44% allowing legislature to consider work requirements</li>
<li><strong>Work requirement status</strong>: Requires federal waiver approval; implementation uncertain</li>
</ul>
<p>The potential for Medicaid work requirements creates planning uncertainty for RHTP initiatives designed to serve low-income populations. If work requirements cause coverage losses as seen in other states, some RHTP investment in care delivery may face reduced demand even as infrastructure improves.</p>
<h2 id="state-approach">State Approach<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#state-approach">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Lead Agency and Governance</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>South Dakota Department of Health</strong> serves as lead agency for RHTP implementation, with direct involvement from the Governor&rsquo;s Office. Governor Larry Rhoden announced the award on December 29, 2025, emphasizing the collaborative development process.</p>
<p><strong>Key Partners</strong></p>
<p>The state&rsquo;s application development involved extensive stakeholder coordination:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>South Dakota Association of Healthcare Organizations (SDAHO)</strong>: Represents hospital and facility interests</li>
<li><strong>Great Plains Tribal Leaders Health Board</strong>: Coordinates with nine tribal nations</li>
<li><strong>Sanford Health and Avera Health</strong>: Major regional health systems covering most of the state</li>
<li><strong>Monument Health</strong>: Black Hills region health system</li>
<li><strong>Horizon Health</strong>: FQHC network operating 31 clinics across 22 communities, including six reservations</li>
<li><strong>Community HealthCare Association of the Dakotas</strong>: Represents FQHCs and advocates for primary care access</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Strategic Framework</strong></p>
<p>The state&rsquo;s application addresses the <strong>geographic concentration problem</strong> directly, acknowledging that 77% of Critical Access Hospitals cluster in eastern South Dakota. The strategy emphasizes:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Regionalization</strong>: Creating coordinated regional networks rather than independent facility operations</li>
<li><strong>Technology and Self-Monitoring</strong>: Extending care reach through telehealth and remote patient monitoring</li>
<li><strong>Prevention and Chronic Disease Management</strong>: Reducing emergency department utilization through upstream intervention</li>
<li><strong>Payment Model Transformation</strong>: Moving toward value-based care for sustainability</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Community Input Process</strong></p>
<p>The Department of Health conducted statewide Community Conversations before finalizing the application. Participants identified consistent themes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Access to healthcare is limited in many rural communities</li>
<li>There are not enough healthcare workers across fields</li>
<li>Transportation is a major barrier to receiving care</li>
<li>Limited access to dental and behavioral health services</li>
<li>Need for affordable, local care</li>
</ul>
<p>Proposed solutions from community input included expanding telehealth and mobile clinics, improving broadband access, supporting rural provider recruitment, and developing community-based transportation and wellness initiatives.</p>
<h2 id="program-and-funding-distribution">Program and Funding Distribution<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#program-and-funding-distribution">#</a></h2>
<p>South Dakota&rsquo;s application proposed multiple programs totaling approximately <strong>$580 million in identified initiatives</strong> over five years. The following reflects requested amounts from the state application, as actual funded levels may vary:</p>

<p><strong>Major Initiative Details</strong></p>
<p><strong>Regional Partnership Grants ($125 million)</strong>: The largest single initiative funds grants incentivizing South Dakota healthcare providers to explore regional assessments and partnerships. Providers can use grants to improve professional and management services affecting facility finances. The goal is sustainable regional coordination allowing hospitals and clinics to coordinate services, offer complementary care, and strengthen financial stability.</p>
<p><strong>EMS Regionalization ($64 million)</strong>: Creates regional emergency medical service hubs to reduce response times, offer professional development, and improve technology. The state has already invested millions in EMS technology upgrades and issued a report on EMS sustainability recommendations. Target outcomes include <strong>improving emergency response times and increasing EMS workforce by 15%</strong> within two years.</p>
<p><strong>Medicaid Value-Based Payment ($62.6 million)</strong>: Supports a new Medicaid payment model providing more predictable revenue to health care systems, rewarding quality, and allowing facilities to maintain comprehensive services in rural areas. This initiative represents the state&rsquo;s primary payment transformation effort.</p>
<p><strong>Workforce Recruitment ($62.5 million)</strong>: Provides recruitment incentives including sign-on bonuses, relocation assistance, and rural service stipends. The program includes five-year sign-on commitments and expands apprenticeship programs. Target: <strong>recruit 500 rural professionals by 2030</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>CCBHC Establishment ($56.4 million)</strong>: South Dakota currently has <strong>no certified community behavioral health clinics</strong> providing mental health and substance use services regardless of insurance status. This initiative would establish at least one CCBHC in each of the state&rsquo;s behavioral health regions, plus mobile crisis teams and crisis stabilization facilities to reduce emergency room visits and jail holds.</p>
<p><strong>Maternal Health Hubs ($24 million)</strong>: Funds analysis of maternal health gaps (service shortages, social supports, workforce needs, regulatory barriers) and then funds three healthcare entities to create regional maternal health hubs using telehealth, remote monitoring, and in-person visits to address transportation and accessibility issues in rural and tribal areas.</p>

<p><strong>Social Determinants Assessment</strong></p>
<p>South Dakota&rsquo;s application embeds social care considerations within clinical initiatives rather than establishing distinct SDOH programs. The Community Conversations process identified transportation, food access, and housing as significant barriers, but the resulting proposal focuses primarily on clinical access expansion through technology rather than direct social needs intervention.</p>
<p><strong>Community Health Worker Programs</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>$3.5 million CHW development initiative</strong> supports growth of community health workers in the state&rsquo;s healthcare system. Specific activities include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developing Medicaid claims pathways for CHW services</li>
<li>Creating Medicare billing pathways</li>
<li>Supporting CHW certification and training</li>
<li>Integrating CHWs into clinical workflows</li>
</ul>
<p>The state currently has <strong>180 certified community health representatives</strong>, primarily serving tribal populations. The RHTP investment aims to expand CHW deployment beyond tribal settings into broader rural healthcare delivery.</p>
<p><strong>Horizon Health</strong> operates as a significant social care intermediary, with 31 clinics across 22 communities covering a 28,000 square mile service area serving nearly 30,000 patients annually. Operating on six of nine reservations, Horizon provides primary and preventive care designed to prevent more serious conditions while connecting patients requiring more intensive services to appropriate resources.</p>
<p><strong>Technology Infrastructure Gap</strong></p>
<p>Unlike states proposing comprehensive Community Information Exchange platforms, South Dakota&rsquo;s application does not explicitly include CIE deployment. The technology emphasis focuses on <strong>telehealth expansion and remote patient monitoring</strong> rather than closed-loop referral systems for social services. This represents a potential gap in the state&rsquo;s social care architecture.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="assessment">Assessment<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#assessment">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
<p><strong>Formula Advantage Creates Opportunity</strong>. South Dakota&rsquo;s <strong>~$486 per rural resident</strong> represents substantial resources relative to population. Unlike Texas or North Carolina where per-capita funding forces triage decisions, South Dakota can pursue comprehensive transformation if implementation executes effectively.</p>
<p><strong>Medicaid Expansion Foundation</strong>. The July 2023 expansion provides coverage infrastructure that RHTP investments can build upon. Approximately 28,000 new enrollees represent both patients for transformed care delivery and revenue stability for rural providers transitioning to value-based models.</p>
<p><strong>Strong Hospital Network</strong>. The state&rsquo;s <strong>40 Critical Access Hospitals</strong> have avoided the closure crisis affecting other rural states. While geographic distribution challenges exist, the network provides a foundation for regional coordination rather than starting from emergency stabilization.</p>
<p><strong>Tribal Partnership Framework</strong>. Including the Great Plains Tribal Leaders Health Board in application development and explicitly addressing tribal areas in the maternal health hub initiative demonstrates awareness of where disparities are most severe. Whether this translates to proportionate resource allocation remains to be seen.</p>
<p><strong>Vulnerabilities</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reservation Disconnect</strong>. The fundamental question is whether favorable state-level funding translates to meaningful improvement on reservations experiencing the most acute health crises. RHTP funds flow through the state, not directly to tribal health systems or IHS. The $3.5 million CHW investment is modest relative to the scale of reservation health disparities.</p>
<p><strong>Work Requirement Uncertainty</strong>. Amendment F&rsquo;s passage authorizes (but does not implement) Medicaid work requirements. If implemented under federal waiver approval, work requirements could cause coverage losses undermining RHTP care delivery investments. States implementing work requirements have seen significant enrollment declines.</p>
<p><strong>Eastern Concentration Persistence</strong>. The geographic concentration problem, with 77% of CAHs in eastern South Dakota, reflects decades of population and economic patterns unlikely to shift through five years of transformation funding. Whether regionalization and technology can adequately compensate for physical facility gaps remains unproven.</p>
<p><strong>No CCBHC Baseline</strong>. Starting from zero certified community behavioral health clinics means the $56.4 million investment must build infrastructure, workforce, and organizational capacity simultaneously. States with existing CCBHC networks can expand; South Dakota must create.</p>
<p><strong>Sustainability Prospects</strong></p>
<p>South Dakota&rsquo;s <strong>favorable Medicaid gap position</strong> (RHTP roughly offsetting projected cuts) provides more realistic sustainability prospects than states facing massive net reductions. However, post-2030 continuation requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>State general fund commitment unlikely given conservative fiscal philosophy</li>
<li>Successful transition to value-based payment generating provider revenue independent of grants</li>
<li>Federal renewal or replacement program</li>
</ul>
<p>The value-based payment transformation initiative ($62.6 million) explicitly targets sustainability by creating payment models that reward quality rather than requiring ongoing federal subsidies. Success here determines whether other investments become permanent or experimental.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Success Factors</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Tribal health proportionality</strong>: Whether reservation communities receive RHTP investment proportionate to disparity severity</li>
<li><strong>CCBHC establishment velocity</strong>: Building behavioral health infrastructure from zero before funding expires</li>
<li><strong>Work requirement resolution</strong>: Clarity on Medicaid eligibility stability for planning purposes</li>
<li><strong>EMS workforce achievement</strong>: Meeting 15% workforce increase target within two years</li>
<li><strong>Regional partnership formalization</strong>: Moving beyond grant incentives to sustainable coordination structures</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>South Dakota enters RHTP implementation with <strong>structural advantages unavailable to most states</strong>: favorable per-capita funding, recent Medicaid expansion, stable hospital network, and projected Medicaid cuts roughly offset by transformation investment. The state&rsquo;s application demonstrates strategic awareness of geographic access challenges and proposes reasonable interventions around regionalization, workforce, and payment transformation.</p>
<p>The <strong>central question is not whether South Dakota has adequate resources</strong>, but whether those resources reach the populations experiencing the most severe disparities. Pine Ridge and Rosebud reservations contain health outcomes that would constitute emergency conditions anywhere else in the developed world. If RHTP success is measured by statewide averages improving modestly while reservation life expectancy remains decades below national norms, the program will have failed its fundamental purpose.</p>
<p><strong>What to Watch</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Q1-Q2 2026 subaward announcements showing geographic and population distribution of funds</li>
<li>CCBHC site selection and timeline for behavioral health infrastructure</li>
<li>Tribal health funding proportionality in maternal health hub and workforce initiatives</li>
<li>EMS regionalization progress toward 15% workforce target</li>
<li>Medicaid work requirement waiver application and CMS response under current administration</li>
</ul>
<p>South Dakota&rsquo;s RHTP implementation tests whether the formula advantage creates genuine opportunity or simply delivers resources to areas that already function relatively well. The state&rsquo;s trajectory over the next five years will reveal whether frontier funding benefits translate to frontier communities or bypass them entirely.</p>
