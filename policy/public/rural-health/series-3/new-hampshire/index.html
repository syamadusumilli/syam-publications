  "articleBody": "New Hampshire received $204,016,550 in FY2026 RHTP funding, the largest award among all New England states and approximately $4 million above the national average. More significant than the raw dollar figure is the state’s fourth-highest technical application score nationally, trailing only Alaska, Texas, and Nebraska. This combination of strong funding and exceptional technical performance positions New Hampshire as a potential model for rural health transformation in the Northeast.\nThe state requested $200 million annually throughout the five-year program, projecting approximately $1 billion in total RHTP investment from FY2026 through FY2030. Governor Kelly Ayotte’s administration branded the application “Granite Strong. Future Ready” and established dedicated implementation infrastructure before awards were even announced.\nYet technical excellence on paper confronts a healthcare system under genuine stress. Half of New Hampshire’s acute care hospitals serve rural communities, and seven operated at losses in 2024. The state’s 1.6% operating margin ranks far below the 5.2% national average. More than 40% of the state’s birthing hospitals have closed their labor and delivery units since 2002, creating maternity deserts that force pregnant patients to drive an hour or more for basic obstetric care. RHTP funding arrives at a moment when New Hampshire’s rural health infrastructure is demonstrably fragile.\nRural Health Landscape State Context\nNew Hampshire’s geography presents a distinctive challenge. The state’s 47% rural population resides across 84% of its landmass, concentrated in the North Country and western regions while population centers cluster in the southern tier along the Massachusetts border. Ten counties span 9,351 square miles of predominantly forested terrain, with population density ranging from Rockingham’s 464 people per square mile to Coos County’s sparse 17.\nThe state’s demographic profile differs significantly from other rural states. With a median household income exceeding $95,000 and an unemployment rate of approximately 2.5%, New Hampshire ranks among the most affluent and economically stable states nationally. Yet this aggregate prosperity masks significant internal disparities. Coos County, the state’s northernmost and most rural region, shows population decline while other areas grow. Districts in Berlin and the North Country have Medicaid enrollment rates approaching 30%, more than three times the rate of affluent coastal communities.\nPopulation growth since 2020 has actually concentrated in rural areas, particularly the Lakes Region and areas near the White Mountains, driven by remote work opportunities and retirement migration. This inbound movement increases demand for healthcare services in regions where capacity is already constrained.\nHealthcare Infrastructure\nNew Hampshire operates 26 acute care hospitals, of which 13 carry Critical Access Hospital designation. These CAHs function as the healthcare backbone for rural communities, providing emergency services, primary care, behavioral health, and care coordination in areas where no alternatives exist. The state also supports 11 Federally Qualified Health Centers delivering care at 47 sites and 14 Rural Health Clinics, almost all affiliated with CAHs.\nThe state’s healthcare system is highly consolidated. Recent years have seen extensive merger activity, with only four of the 26 acute care hospitals remaining independent of larger systems. Dartmouth Health operates as the largest system, housing the state’s only Level I trauma center and only comprehensive children’s hospital. This consolidation creates efficiencies but also means that decisions made at system headquarters directly impact rural facilities across the state.\nHospital Financial Distress\nThe New Hampshire Hospital Association’s December 2024 report documented a healthcare system under significant financial pressure. Seven hospitals operated at losses in 2024, including four of the state’s 13 Critical Access Hospitals. The statewide operating margin of 1.6% compares unfavorably to the 5.2% national average, leaving minimal financial cushion for unexpected costs or investment needs.\nCost pressures have escalated dramatically. Total operating expenses increased 44% from 2019 to 2024, with labor costs rising 36% over the same period. Hospital occupancy rates hover around 90%, significantly above the 75% national average in the post-pandemic period, indicating persistent capacity constraints.\nWorkforce shortages compound financial stress. The registered nurse vacancy rate stands at approximately 17%, down from 20% at the pandemic peak but still above the 14% pre-pandemic baseline. Filling vacancies with expensive temporary staff drives costs higher while care quality suffers from discontinuity.\nGovernment reimbursement fails to cover the actual cost of providing care. Medicare and Medicaid payments fall short of expenses, requiring hospitals to shift costs to commercial payers or absorb losses directly. The Hospital Association warned that anticipated federal Medicaid cuts will force further program and service reductions.\nMaternity Care Collapse\nNew Hampshire has experienced one of the nation’s most dramatic contractions in rural obstetric services. Eleven hospitals have closed their labor and delivery units since 2002, representing more than 40% of the state’s birthing facilities. Nine of the state’s 16 rural hospitals eliminated obstetric services.\nThe human geography of this collapse is stark. Before the closures, approximately 7% of New Hampshire’s population lived more than 30 minutes from a hospital with labor and delivery services. That figure has nearly tripled to 19%. The median driving time to the nearest birthing hospital doubled from 18 minutes to 39 minutes after the wave of closures. For approximately 14,000 Granite Staters, the drive exceeds one hour. Residents of Pittsburg in the far North Country face nearly two hours of travel to reach the nearest birthing hospital in Littleton.\nAndroscoggin Valley Hospital in Berlin now operates as the only labor and delivery unit in all of northern New Hampshire, delivering approximately 70 babies annually compared to over 2,000 at Elliot Hospital in Manchester. The unit’s survival depends on external support, including participation in the North Country Maternity Network, a four-year federal grant program managed by Dartmouth Health that deploys doulas, trains nurses in high-risk pregnancy management, and helps hospitals improve billing practices.\nThe consequences of maternity desert expansion are measurable. Unplanned location births have increased from 2.2 per 1,000 live births in 2005 to 3.8 per 1,000 in 2022. Patients with longer travel times receive fewer prenatal visits and face elevated risks of roadside or unplanned home deliveries. EMS personnel require specialized obstetric training to handle deliveries they increasingly encounter in the field.\nWorkforce Crisis\nNew Hampshire’s healthcare workforce faces demographic and geographic challenges that RHTP funding alone cannot resolve. Rural communities face significant shortages in outpatient services, with only about 20% of licensed providers practicing in rural areas despite nearly half the population residing there.\nThe state’s behavioral health workforce presents particular concern. Psychologists practicing in New Hampshire show a 3-to-1 ratio of practitioners over 60 compared to those under 40, with one-third anticipating practice reductions within five years. Rural psychologists are less likely to practice in outpatient settings compared to their urban counterparts, further limiting access.\nThe Legislative Commission on the Interdisciplinary Primary Care Workforce has advocated since 2010 for policy changes to strengthen the primary care workforce, particularly in rural and underserved areas. The State Loan Repayment Program remains an essential recruitment tool, but funding constraints limit its reach. Interstate licensure compacts and team-based care models represent potential strategies but require sustained implementation effort.\nRHTP Award and Context Funding Analysis\nNew Hampshire’s $204 million FY2026 award reflects both the equal distribution baseline ($100 million per state) and strong performance on workload allocation factors. The $104 million workload component exceeds the national average, driven primarily by the state’s exceptional technical application score.\nThe fourth-highest technical score nationally distinguishes New Hampshire’s application. Technical scoring rewards policy actions, stakeholder engagement, innovation potential, and alignment with CMS priorities including the “Make America Healthy Again” initiative. New Hampshire’s application evidently excelled across these dimensions.\nPer capita analysis tells a different story. With approximately 640,000 rural residents (47% of 1.4 million), the award translates to roughly $319 per rural resident annually, comparable to other New England states but modest compared to sparsely populated Western states receiving per capita allocations exceeding $300 or Alaska’s extraordinary $368.\nMedicaid Expansion History\nNew Hampshire expanded Medicaid eligibility in July 2014 under the Granite Advantage Health Care Program, becoming one of the first Republican-led states to adopt expansion. The program covers adults ages 19 to 64 with incomes below 138% of the federal poverty level through managed care plans operated by New Hampshire Healthy Families and Well Sense Health Plan.\nTotal Medicaid enrollment reached approximately 187,000 Granite Staters as of 2024, representing about 13% of the state population. The Granite Advantage expansion population averages 58,000 to 61,000 adults, constituting roughly one-third of total Medicaid enrollment.\nExpansion enrollment rates are higher in rural regions, both increasing access to coverage in underserved communities and returning federal dollars to local economies. This rural concentration particularly benefits Critical Access Hospitals, helping them provide services that might otherwise be financially impossible.\nMedicaid’s importance to rural hospitals cannot be overstated. Rural facilities are more dependent on Medicaid to cover births and other services than their urban counterparts, making them acutely vulnerable to reimbursement rate changes. The lower reimbursement rates contribute directly to the financial challenges that have forced labor and delivery closures.\nH.R. 1 Exposure\nNew Hampshire faces significant exposure to H.R. 1’s Medicaid provisions despite its expansion status. The work requirements taking effect December 31, 2026 will require most expansion adults ages 19 to 64 to demonstrate 80 hours of monthly work, training, or community engagement activities as a condition of maintaining coverage.\nNew Hampshire’s state legislature added additional requirements beyond federal mandates, implementing premiums and increased pharmacy co-pays for some Granite Advantage enrollees and CHIP families. For a family of three earning $68,000, monthly premiums will reach $230 with $4 prescription co-pays, creating financial burdens that may prevent families from accessing coverage.\nThe enhanced Federal Medical Assistance Percentage that incentivized expansion sunsets on January 1, 2026, reducing the federal match from 90% to lower levels and shifting costs to the state. More frequent eligibility redeterminations every six months (instead of twelve) will increase administrative burdens and likely drive procedural disenrollments of people who remain technically eligible.\nBased on experience with New Hampshire’s earlier work requirement attempt in 2019, which was blocked by federal courts before full implementation, analysts estimate that 20,000 adults could experience coverage losses from work requirements nationally. New Hampshire spent approximately $6.1 million attempting to implement the 2019 requirements, suggesting significant administrative costs ahead for the current mandate.\nThe combination of federal and state policy changes threatens to increase the uninsured population, raise uncompensated care costs for hospitals already operating at losses, and potentially accelerate service reductions at rural facilities dependent on Medicaid revenue.\nState Approach Governance Structure\nGovernor Kelly Ayotte established the Governor’s Office of New Opportunities \u0026 Rural Transformational Health (GO-NORTH) as an independent entity under the Governor’s office but embedded within DHHS. This structure attempts to balance executive priority with departmental expertise, enabling faster decision-making while leveraging existing DHHS infrastructure.\nDHHS Commissioner Lori Weaver led application development and stakeholder engagement. The application incorporated feedback from more than 300 stakeholders, including hospitals, rural health providers, community health centers, and community mental health centers. Public input was solicited through a formal Request for Information with responses due October 2, 2025.\nThe Governor and Council and Joint Legislative Fiscal Committee approved accept-and-expend authorization for anticipated funding before awards were announced, positioning the state for rapid implementation. Initial investments are expected to support rural providers and communities beginning in 2026.\nNotably, the Executive Council rejected a request to hire consultants to assist with application development, directing DHHS to handle the process in-house. The resulting fourth-highest technical score nationally suggests this approach succeeded.\nFive Strategic Priorities\nNew Hampshire’s application organizes transformation efforts around five pillars:\nPriority 1: Make Rural America Healthy Again\nPreventive health initiatives and new access points promoting physical and mental wellness. This priority aligns explicitly with administration scoring criteria rewarding MAHA-aligned programming. Specific initiatives include nutrition education, physical activity promotion, and preventive care expansion in rural communities.\nPriority 2: Sustainable Access\nStrengthening rural providers and hospitals to ensure continued care availability. This priority addresses the financial distress documented in state hospital reports by providing operational support, technical assistance, and resources to facilities operating at losses. The goal is preventing further closures and service reductions.\nPriority 3: Workforce Development\nExpanding the health care workforce through recruitment, retention, and training programs. Given documented shortages across nursing, behavioral health, and primary care, this priority represents the most frequently cited stakeholder concern. Loan repayment programs tied to five-year rural service commitments, residency support, and pipeline development will receive substantial allocation.\nPriority 4: Innovative Care\nNew care delivery models and payment approaches appropriate for rural contexts. This includes value-based care arrangements, alternative payment models, and care coordination approaches that account for the geographic realities of rural practice. Integration of behavioral health with primary care represents a particular focus given workforce constraints.\nPriority 5: Technology Innovation\nTechnology deployment as a workforce extender and access enabler. Telehealth expansion, remote patient monitoring, consumer-facing chronic disease management tools, and cybersecurity improvements all fall within this priority. The approach recognizes that technology cannot replace providers but can extend their reach across vast rural territories.\nProgram and Funding Distribution\nNew Hampshire’s $204 million FY2026 allocation distributes across five strategic priorities, though detailed program-level allocations await formal implementation plans from GO-NORTH.\nProgram Estimated Allocation Implementing Organization Focus CAH Stabilization Initiative $45M NH Hospital Association/DHHS Operating support for financially distressed CAHs Rural Workforce Pipeline $35M DHHS/Area Health Education Centers Loan repayment, residency support, training Telehealth Expansion $30M Dartmouth Health/regional hospitals Specialty access, behavioral health, remote monitoring Primary Care Capacity $25M Bi-State Primary Care Association FQHC expansion, practice transformation Behavioral Health Integration $25M Community Mental Health Centers Co-location, crisis response, workforce Maternity Care Preservation $15M North Country Maternity Network/AVH L\u0026D unit support, doula programs, transport Rural EMS Enhancement $10M DHHS/regional EMS Training, equipment, obstetric readiness Technology Infrastructure $12M Regional hospitals/DHHS Cybersecurity, HIE connectivity Administrative/Evaluation $7M GO-NORTH/DHHS Program management, outcomes tracking Note: Allocations estimated from priority descriptions and stakeholder communications. Official program budgets pending GO-NORTH implementation guidance.\nStakeholder Engagement\nNew Hampshire’s stakeholder engagement process distinguished the application. Governor Ayotte convened a rural health summit in Littleton in September 2025 bringing together North Country leaders. Commissioner Weaver participated in regular dialogue with hospital associations, community health centers, and behavioral health providers.\nSteve Ahnen, president of the New Hampshire Hospital Association, characterized the RHTP award as “an important investment” that will help modernize care and develop the workforce. He noted that rural hospitals often function as the sole source of emergency, primary care, and behavioral health services for large geographic areas while facing persistent workforce shortages, rising costs, and financial pressures.\nKey Subawardees Organizations positioned to receive RHTP subawards based on application development participation and stated implementation roles:\nIntermediary Organizations\nNew Hampshire Hospital Association: Technical assistance coordination, financial benchmarking, workforce recruitment support. Estimated contract value: $8 to $12 million.\nBi-State Primary Care Association: FQHC network coordination, practice transformation support, workforce pipeline development. Estimated contract value: $6 to $10 million.\nProvider Organizations\nDartmouth Health: Telehealth hub operations, specialty access networks, residency program expansion, Level I trauma and pediatric specialty support. Estimated contract value: $20 to $30 million.\nAndroscoggin Valley Hospital: North Country obstetric services preservation, rural emergency care, workforce retention. Estimated contract value: $5 to $8 million.\nCritical Access Hospitals (13 facilities): Operational support, equipment upgrades, workforce recruitment. Combined estimated allocation: $25 to $35 million.\nBehavioral Health Partners\nCommunity Mental Health Centers: Integrated care models, crisis services, workforce development. Network allocation estimated: $15 to $20 million.\nRiverbend Community Mental Health: Northern region behavioral health services expansion.\nWorkforce Development Partners\nArea Health Education Centers (AHEC): Pipeline programs, clinical rotations, recruitment coordination.\nUniversity of New Hampshire: Nursing program expansion, rural health curriculum development.\nTechnology Partners\nVendor selection pending. GO-NORTH has not announced CIE or SDOH platform vendors. Current HIE infrastructure through regional partnerships.\nSocial Care Integration SDOH and HRSN Assessment\nNew Hampshire’s RHTP application emphasizes medical system transformation over explicit social care infrastructure development. The five strategic priorities focus predominantly on healthcare delivery, workforce, and technology rather than housing, food security, transportation, or other social determinants.\nThe state does recognize that rural residents face compounding challenges beyond healthcare access. Transportation barriers, isolation, and economic instability all contribute to health disparities. However, the application does not propose dedicated Community Information Exchange infrastructure or comprehensive social care coordination platforms comparable to those in states like Oregon or Montana.\nCommunity Health Worker Development\nWorkforce development includes community health workers within its scope, recognizing CHWs as part of team-based care models that maximize limited provider resources. However, CHW deployment appears integrated within broader workforce initiatives rather than structured as a standalone program with dedicated funding and training pathways.\nThe state’s behavioral health workforce crisis creates particular urgency for expanding non-clinical roles. Alcohol and drug counselors demonstrate high accessibility in rural areas with high patient acceptance rates and short wait times, suggesting models for effective paraprofessional deployment that could expand to other domains.\nInfrastructure Gaps\nNew Hampshire lacks a statewide Community Information Exchange platform connecting healthcare providers with social service organizations. The application does not propose creating such infrastructure, though technology innovation priorities could potentially accommodate HIE expansion that incorporates social care referral capabilities.\nThe North Country Maternity Network demonstrates what coordinated community response looks like in practice, bringing together hospitals, social service nonprofits, and health workers around a specific challenge. Scaling this collaborative model to other health challenges and regions represents an opportunity that RHTP funding could support but is not explicitly structured to enable.\nSocial Care Integration Summary\nComponent Included in Plan Estimated Funding Vendor/Operator Likely Funded? SDOH Screening Implicit only Not specified Provider-level At Risk HRSN Navigation Limited Embedded in care coordination FQHC network At Risk CHW Programs Yes (within workforce) $3 to $5M estimated DHHS/AHEC Yes CIE Platform No $0 None proposed No New Hampshire’s social care strategy relies on existing community relationships rather than new infrastructure. This approach acknowledges resource constraints but leaves the state without systematic social care coordination capabilities that other states are building with RHTP funds.\nAssessment Strengths\nTechnical excellence distinguishes New Hampshire’s application. The fourth-highest technical score nationally demonstrates sophisticated understanding of CMS priorities and effective stakeholder engagement. This positions the state favorably for continued funding through FY2030 and potential technical assistance from CMS.\nGovernance clarity through GO-NORTH provides dedicated implementation capacity independent of routine DHHS operations. The Governor’s direct involvement signals political priority that can accelerate decision-making and remove bureaucratic obstacles.\nStakeholder alignment across hospitals, community health centers, and behavioral health providers creates implementation coalition support. The Hospital Association, community health centers, and mental health organizations all participated in application development and publicly support the resulting plan.\nMedicaid expansion provides coverage foundation that other states lack. Higher rural enrollment rates mean RHTP investments build on existing access rather than serving populations without any coverage mechanism.\nRegional leadership as the largest New England award creates opportunity for multi-state collaboration. Vermont ($195 million), Maine ($190 million), and Massachusetts ($162 million) all received substantial funding for relatively small rural populations, enabling potential cross-border coordination on workforce and telehealth initiatives.\nVulnerabilities\nHospital financial baseline presents immediate risk. With seven hospitals operating at losses including four CAHs, RHTP funds may be consumed maintaining current services rather than enabling genuine transformation. The 1.6% statewide operating margin leaves no cushion for unexpected costs.\nMaternity care collapse has already occurred and cannot be easily reversed. Eleven hospital closures represent permanent capacity loss. RHTP funding can support remaining facilities and expand alternative models, but reopening closed units faces economic realities that transformation dollars alone cannot overcome.\nMedicaid cut exposure threatens the coverage foundation RHTP investments build upon. Work requirements, increased redeterminations, and cost-sharing provisions will reduce Medicaid enrollment, increasing uncompensated care costs and further straining hospital finances. The state’s additional requirements beyond federal mandates compound this exposure.\nSocial care infrastructure gaps limit the state’s ability to address root causes of rural health disparities. Without dedicated investment in CIE platforms, CHW programs, and SDOH coordination, medical system transformation proceeds without the community health infrastructure that determines long-term outcomes.\nWorkforce demographics work against improvement timelines. Behavioral health practitioners aging out of practice faster than they can be replaced creates a shrinking window for knowledge transfer and succession planning. The five-year RHTP commitment requirements help with retention but cannot accelerate training pipelines.\n2030 Sustainability Question\nNew Hampshire’s combination of technical excellence and genuine structural crisis creates a test case for RHTP’s theory of change. Can federal investment stabilize a fragile healthcare system during the five-year program period while building capacity for sustainability after funding ends?\nThe state’s affluence provides advantages unavailable elsewhere. Higher income levels mean greater capacity for local funding alternatives, private philanthropy, and employer-sponsored coverage expansion. Economic stability reduces the poverty-driven health disparities that compound healthcare access challenges in other rural states.\nYet affluence has not prevented maternity care collapse, hospital financial distress, or workforce shortages. Market forces alone have proven insufficient to maintain rural healthcare infrastructure in New Hampshire. RHTP funding represents a significant temporary resource, but the structural economics that closed eleven birthing units and put seven hospitals in the red will persist after 2030.\nThe honest assessment is that New Hampshire’s exceptional technical score reflects application quality rather than healthcare system health. The state has correctly identified transformation priorities and designed credible initiatives. Whether those initiatives can overcome structural forces that have been eroding rural healthcare for decades remains uncertain. RHTP provides resources; outcomes depend on implementation and on factors beyond any state’s control.\nConclusion New Hampshire brings genuine technical sophistication to rural health transformation. The fourth-highest technical score nationally, dedicated governance infrastructure, and strong stakeholder alignment demonstrate state capacity that many rural health systems lack.\nYet the Granite State also brings genuine crisis. Hospital losses, maternity deserts, workforce shortages, and Medicaid vulnerability create headwinds that transformation funding must first overcome before enabling forward progress.

  </a>
</div>

<p>New Hampshire received <strong>$204,016,550 in FY2026 RHTP funding</strong>, the largest award among all New England states and approximately $4 million above the national average. More significant than the raw dollar figure is the state&rsquo;s <strong>fourth-highest technical application score nationally</strong>, trailing only Alaska, Texas, and Nebraska. This combination of strong funding and exceptional technical performance positions New Hampshire as a potential model for rural health transformation in the Northeast.</p>
<p>The state requested $200 million annually throughout the five-year program, projecting approximately <strong>$1 billion in total RHTP investment</strong> from FY2026 through FY2030. Governor Kelly Ayotte&rsquo;s administration branded the application &ldquo;<strong>Granite Strong. Future Ready</strong>&rdquo; and established dedicated implementation infrastructure before awards were even announced.</p>
<p>Yet technical excellence on paper confronts a healthcare system under genuine stress. Half of New Hampshire&rsquo;s acute care hospitals serve rural communities, and seven operated at losses in 2024. The state&rsquo;s <strong>1.6% operating margin</strong> ranks far below the 5.2% national average. More than 40% of the state&rsquo;s birthing hospitals have closed their labor and delivery units since 2002, creating maternity deserts that force pregnant patients to drive an hour or more for basic obstetric care. RHTP funding arrives at a moment when New Hampshire&rsquo;s rural health infrastructure is demonstrably fragile.</p>
<h2 id="rural-health-landscape">Rural Health Landscape<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#rural-health-landscape">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>State Context</strong></p>
<p>New Hampshire&rsquo;s geography presents a distinctive challenge. The state&rsquo;s <strong>47% rural population</strong> resides across <strong>84% of its landmass</strong>, concentrated in the North Country and western regions while population centers cluster in the southern tier along the Massachusetts border. Ten counties span 9,351 square miles of predominantly forested terrain, with population density ranging from Rockingham&rsquo;s 464 people per square mile to Coos County&rsquo;s sparse 17.</p>
<p>The state&rsquo;s demographic profile differs significantly from other rural states. With a <strong>median household income exceeding $95,000</strong> and an unemployment rate of approximately 2.5%, New Hampshire ranks among the most affluent and economically stable states nationally. Yet this aggregate prosperity masks significant internal disparities. Coos County, the state&rsquo;s northernmost and most rural region, shows population decline while other areas grow. Districts in Berlin and the North Country have Medicaid enrollment rates approaching 30%, more than three times the rate of affluent coastal communities.</p>
<p>Population growth since 2020 has actually concentrated in rural areas, particularly the Lakes Region and areas near the White Mountains, driven by remote work opportunities and retirement migration. This inbound movement increases demand for healthcare services in regions where capacity is already constrained.</p>
<p><strong>Healthcare Infrastructure</strong></p>
<p>New Hampshire operates <strong>26 acute care hospitals</strong>, of which <strong>13 carry Critical Access Hospital designation</strong>. These CAHs function as the healthcare backbone for rural communities, providing emergency services, primary care, behavioral health, and care coordination in areas where no alternatives exist. The state also supports <strong>11 Federally Qualified Health Centers</strong> delivering care at 47 sites and <strong>14 Rural Health Clinics</strong>, almost all affiliated with CAHs.</p>
<p>The state&rsquo;s healthcare system is highly consolidated. Recent years have seen extensive merger activity, with only four of the 26 acute care hospitals remaining independent of larger systems. Dartmouth Health operates as the largest system, housing the state&rsquo;s only Level I trauma center and only comprehensive children&rsquo;s hospital. This consolidation creates efficiencies but also means that decisions made at system headquarters directly impact rural facilities across the state.</p>
<p><strong>Hospital Financial Distress</strong></p>
<p>The New Hampshire Hospital Association&rsquo;s December 2024 report documented a healthcare system under significant financial pressure. <strong>Seven hospitals operated at losses in 2024</strong>, including <strong>four of the state&rsquo;s 13 Critical Access Hospitals</strong>. The statewide operating margin of 1.6% compares unfavorably to the 5.2% national average, leaving minimal financial cushion for unexpected costs or investment needs.</p>
<p>Cost pressures have escalated dramatically. <strong>Total operating expenses increased 44% from 2019 to 2024</strong>, with <strong>labor costs rising 36%</strong> over the same period. Hospital occupancy rates hover around <strong>90%</strong>, significantly above the 75% national average in the post-pandemic period, indicating persistent capacity constraints.</p>
<p>Workforce shortages compound financial stress. The registered nurse vacancy rate stands at approximately <strong>17%</strong>, down from 20% at the pandemic peak but still above the 14% pre-pandemic baseline. Filling vacancies with expensive temporary staff drives costs higher while care quality suffers from discontinuity.</p>
<p>Government reimbursement fails to cover the actual cost of providing care. Medicare and Medicaid payments fall short of expenses, requiring hospitals to shift costs to commercial payers or absorb losses directly. The Hospital Association warned that anticipated federal Medicaid cuts will force further program and service reductions.</p>
<p><strong>Maternity Care Collapse</strong></p>
<p>New Hampshire has experienced one of the nation&rsquo;s most dramatic contractions in rural obstetric services. <strong>Eleven hospitals have closed their labor and delivery units since 2002</strong>, representing more than 40% of the state&rsquo;s birthing facilities. Nine of the state&rsquo;s 16 rural hospitals eliminated obstetric services.</p>
<p>The human geography of this collapse is stark. Before the closures, approximately 7% of New Hampshire&rsquo;s population lived more than 30 minutes from a hospital with labor and delivery services. That figure has nearly tripled to <strong>19%</strong>. The median driving time to the nearest birthing hospital <strong>doubled from 18 minutes to 39 minutes</strong> after the wave of closures. For approximately <strong>14,000 Granite Staters</strong>, the drive exceeds one hour. Residents of Pittsburg in the far North Country face nearly two hours of travel to reach the nearest birthing hospital in Littleton.</p>
<p><strong>Androscoggin Valley Hospital</strong> in Berlin now operates as the only labor and delivery unit in all of northern New Hampshire, delivering approximately <strong>70 babies annually</strong> compared to over 2,000 at Elliot Hospital in Manchester. The unit&rsquo;s survival depends on external support, including participation in the <strong>North Country Maternity Network</strong>, a four-year federal grant program managed by Dartmouth Health that deploys doulas, trains nurses in high-risk pregnancy management, and helps hospitals improve billing practices.</p>
<p>The consequences of maternity desert expansion are measurable. Unplanned location births have increased from 2.2 per 1,000 live births in 2005 to <strong>3.8 per 1,000 in 2022</strong>. Patients with longer travel times receive fewer prenatal visits and face elevated risks of roadside or unplanned home deliveries. EMS personnel require specialized obstetric training to handle deliveries they increasingly encounter in the field.</p>
<p><strong>Workforce Crisis</strong></p>
<p>New Hampshire&rsquo;s healthcare workforce faces demographic and geographic challenges that RHTP funding alone cannot resolve. Rural communities face significant shortages in outpatient services, with <strong>only about 20% of licensed providers practicing in rural areas</strong> despite nearly half the population residing there.</p>
<p>The state&rsquo;s behavioral health workforce presents particular concern. Psychologists practicing in New Hampshire show <strong>a 3-to-1 ratio of practitioners over 60 compared to those under 40</strong>, with one-third anticipating practice reductions within five years. Rural psychologists are less likely to practice in outpatient settings compared to their urban counterparts, further limiting access.</p>
<p>The Legislative Commission on the Interdisciplinary Primary Care Workforce has advocated since 2010 for policy changes to strengthen the primary care workforce, particularly in rural and underserved areas. The State Loan Repayment Program remains an essential recruitment tool, but funding constraints limit its reach. Interstate licensure compacts and team-based care models represent potential strategies but require sustained implementation effort.</p>
<h2 id="rhtp-award-and-context">RHTP Award and Context<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#rhtp-award-and-context">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Funding Analysis</strong></p>
<p>New Hampshire&rsquo;s $204 million FY2026 award reflects both the equal distribution baseline ($100 million per state) and strong performance on workload allocation factors. The <strong>$104 million workload component</strong> exceeds the national average, driven primarily by the state&rsquo;s exceptional technical application score.</p>
<p>The <strong>fourth-highest technical score nationally</strong> distinguishes New Hampshire&rsquo;s application. Technical scoring rewards policy actions, stakeholder engagement, innovation potential, and alignment with CMS priorities including the &ldquo;Make America Healthy Again&rdquo; initiative. New Hampshire&rsquo;s application evidently excelled across these dimensions.</p>
<p>Per capita analysis tells a different story. With approximately 640,000 rural residents (47% of 1.4 million), the award translates to roughly <strong>$319 per rural resident annually</strong>, comparable to other New England states but modest compared to sparsely populated Western states receiving per capita allocations exceeding $300 or Alaska&rsquo;s extraordinary $368.</p>
<p><strong>Medicaid Expansion History</strong></p>
<p>New Hampshire expanded Medicaid eligibility in July 2014 under the <strong>Granite Advantage Health Care Program</strong>, becoming one of the first Republican-led states to adopt expansion. The program covers adults ages 19 to 64 with incomes below 138% of the federal poverty level through managed care plans operated by New Hampshire Healthy Families and Well Sense Health Plan.</p>
<p>Total Medicaid enrollment reached approximately <strong>187,000 Granite Staters</strong> as of 2024, representing about 13% of the state population. The Granite Advantage expansion population averages <strong>58,000 to 61,000 adults</strong>, constituting roughly one-third of total Medicaid enrollment.</p>
<p>Expansion enrollment rates are <strong>higher in rural regions</strong>, both increasing access to coverage in underserved communities and returning federal dollars to local economies. This rural concentration particularly benefits Critical Access Hospitals, helping them provide services that might otherwise be financially impossible.</p>
<p>Medicaid&rsquo;s importance to rural hospitals cannot be overstated. Rural facilities are more dependent on Medicaid to cover births and other services than their urban counterparts, making them acutely vulnerable to reimbursement rate changes. The lower reimbursement rates contribute directly to the financial challenges that have forced labor and delivery closures.</p>
<p><strong>H.R. 1 Exposure</strong></p>
<p>New Hampshire faces significant exposure to H.R. 1&rsquo;s Medicaid provisions despite its expansion status. The <strong>work requirements taking effect December 31, 2026</strong> will require most expansion adults ages 19 to 64 to demonstrate 80 hours of monthly work, training, or community engagement activities as a condition of maintaining coverage.</p>
<p>New Hampshire&rsquo;s state legislature added <strong>additional requirements beyond federal mandates</strong>, implementing premiums and increased pharmacy co-pays for some Granite Advantage enrollees and CHIP families. For a family of three earning $68,000, monthly premiums will reach $230 with $4 prescription co-pays, creating financial burdens that may prevent families from accessing coverage.</p>
<p>The <strong>enhanced Federal Medical Assistance Percentage</strong> that incentivized expansion sunsets on January 1, 2026, reducing the federal match from 90% to lower levels and shifting costs to the state. More frequent eligibility redeterminations every six months (instead of twelve) will increase administrative burdens and likely drive procedural disenrollments of people who remain technically eligible.</p>
<p>Based on experience with New Hampshire&rsquo;s earlier work requirement attempt in 2019, which was blocked by federal courts before full implementation, analysts estimate that <strong>20,000 adults could experience coverage losses</strong> from work requirements nationally. New Hampshire spent approximately $6.1 million attempting to implement the 2019 requirements, suggesting significant administrative costs ahead for the current mandate.</p>
<p>The combination of federal and state policy changes threatens to increase the uninsured population, raise uncompensated care costs for hospitals already operating at losses, and potentially accelerate service reductions at rural facilities dependent on Medicaid revenue.</p>
<h2 id="state-approach">State Approach<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#state-approach">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Governance Structure</strong></p>
<p>Governor Kelly Ayotte established the <strong>Governor&rsquo;s Office of New Opportunities &amp; Rural Transformational Health (GO-NORTH)</strong> as an independent entity under the Governor&rsquo;s office but embedded within DHHS. This structure attempts to balance executive priority with departmental expertise, enabling faster decision-making while leveraging existing DHHS infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>DHHS Commissioner Lori Weaver</strong> led application development and stakeholder engagement. The application incorporated feedback from <strong>more than 300 stakeholders</strong>, including hospitals, rural health providers, community health centers, and community mental health centers. Public input was solicited through a formal Request for Information with responses due October 2, 2025.</p>
<p>The Governor and Council and Joint Legislative Fiscal Committee approved accept-and-expend authorization for anticipated funding before awards were announced, positioning the state for rapid implementation. Initial investments are expected to support rural providers and communities beginning in 2026.</p>
<p>Notably, the Executive Council rejected a request to hire consultants to assist with application development, directing DHHS to handle the process in-house. The resulting fourth-highest technical score nationally suggests this approach succeeded.</p>
<p><strong>Five Strategic Priorities</strong></p>
<p>New Hampshire&rsquo;s application organizes transformation efforts around five pillars:</p>
<p><strong>Priority 1: Make Rural America Healthy Again</strong></p>
<p>Preventive health initiatives and new access points promoting physical and mental wellness. This priority aligns explicitly with administration scoring criteria rewarding MAHA-aligned programming. Specific initiatives include nutrition education, physical activity promotion, and preventive care expansion in rural communities.</p>
<p><strong>Priority 2: Sustainable Access</strong></p>
<p>Strengthening rural providers and hospitals to ensure continued care availability. This priority addresses the financial distress documented in state hospital reports by providing operational support, technical assistance, and resources to facilities operating at losses. The goal is preventing further closures and service reductions.</p>
<p><strong>Priority 3: Workforce Development</strong></p>
<p>Expanding the health care workforce through recruitment, retention, and training programs. Given documented shortages across nursing, behavioral health, and primary care, this priority represents the most frequently cited stakeholder concern. Loan repayment programs tied to five-year rural service commitments, residency support, and pipeline development will receive substantial allocation.</p>
<p><strong>Priority 4: Innovative Care</strong></p>
<p>New care delivery models and payment approaches appropriate for rural contexts. This includes value-based care arrangements, alternative payment models, and care coordination approaches that account for the geographic realities of rural practice. Integration of behavioral health with primary care represents a particular focus given workforce constraints.</p>
<p><strong>Priority 5: Technology Innovation</strong></p>
<p>Technology deployment as a workforce extender and access enabler. Telehealth expansion, remote patient monitoring, consumer-facing chronic disease management tools, and cybersecurity improvements all fall within this priority. The approach recognizes that technology cannot replace providers but can extend their reach across vast rural territories.</p>
<p><strong>Program and Funding Distribution</strong></p>
<p>New Hampshire&rsquo;s <strong>$204 million FY2026 allocation</strong> distributes across five strategic priorities, though detailed program-level allocations await formal implementation plans from GO-NORTH.</p>

<p><strong>Stakeholder Engagement</strong></p>
<p>New Hampshire&rsquo;s stakeholder engagement process distinguished the application. Governor Ayotte convened a rural health summit in Littleton in September 2025 bringing together North Country leaders. Commissioner Weaver participated in regular dialogue with hospital associations, community health centers, and behavioral health providers.</p>
<p>Steve Ahnen, president of the New Hampshire Hospital Association, characterized the RHTP award as &ldquo;an important investment&rdquo; that will help modernize care and develop the workforce. He noted that rural hospitals often function as the sole source of emergency, primary care, and behavioral health services for large geographic areas while facing persistent workforce shortages, rising costs, and financial pressures.</p>

<p><strong>SDOH and HRSN Assessment</strong></p>
<p>New Hampshire&rsquo;s RHTP application emphasizes medical system transformation over explicit social care infrastructure development. The five strategic priorities focus predominantly on healthcare delivery, workforce, and technology rather than housing, food security, transportation, or other social determinants.</p>
<p>The state does recognize that rural residents face compounding challenges beyond healthcare access. Transportation barriers, isolation, and economic instability all contribute to health disparities. However, the application does not propose dedicated Community Information Exchange infrastructure or comprehensive social care coordination platforms comparable to those in states like Oregon or Montana.</p>
<p><strong>Community Health Worker Development</strong></p>
<p>Workforce development includes community health workers within its scope, recognizing CHWs as part of team-based care models that maximize limited provider resources. However, CHW deployment appears integrated within broader workforce initiatives rather than structured as a standalone program with dedicated funding and training pathways.</p>
<p>The state&rsquo;s behavioral health workforce crisis creates particular urgency for expanding non-clinical roles. Alcohol and drug counselors demonstrate high accessibility in rural areas with high patient acceptance rates and short wait times, suggesting models for effective paraprofessional deployment that could expand to other domains.</p>
<p><strong>Infrastructure Gaps</strong></p>
<p>New Hampshire lacks a statewide Community Information Exchange platform connecting healthcare providers with social service organizations. The application does not propose creating such infrastructure, though technology innovation priorities could potentially accommodate HIE expansion that incorporates social care referral capabilities.</p>
<p>The North Country Maternity Network demonstrates what coordinated community response looks like in practice, bringing together hospitals, social service nonprofits, and health workers around a specific challenge. Scaling this collaborative model to other health challenges and regions represents an opportunity that RHTP funding could support but is not explicitly structured to enable.</p>

<p>New Hampshire&rsquo;s social care strategy relies on existing community relationships rather than new infrastructure. This approach acknowledges resource constraints but leaves the state without systematic social care coordination capabilities that other states are building with RHTP funds.</p>
<h2 id="assessment">Assessment<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#assessment">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
<p><strong>Technical excellence</strong> distinguishes New Hampshire&rsquo;s application. The fourth-highest technical score nationally demonstrates sophisticated understanding of CMS priorities and effective stakeholder engagement. This positions the state favorably for continued funding through FY2030 and potential technical assistance from CMS.</p>
<p><strong>Governance clarity</strong> through GO-NORTH provides dedicated implementation capacity independent of routine DHHS operations. The Governor&rsquo;s direct involvement signals political priority that can accelerate decision-making and remove bureaucratic obstacles.</p>
<p><strong>Stakeholder alignment</strong> across hospitals, community health centers, and behavioral health providers creates implementation coalition support. The Hospital Association, community health centers, and mental health organizations all participated in application development and publicly support the resulting plan.</p>
<p><strong>Medicaid expansion</strong> provides coverage foundation that other states lack. Higher rural enrollment rates mean RHTP investments build on existing access rather than serving populations without any coverage mechanism.</p>
<p><strong>Regional leadership</strong> as the largest New England award creates opportunity for multi-state collaboration. Vermont ($195 million), Maine ($190 million), and Massachusetts ($162 million) all received substantial funding for relatively small rural populations, enabling potential cross-border coordination on workforce and telehealth initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>Vulnerabilities</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hospital financial baseline</strong> presents immediate risk. With seven hospitals operating at losses including four CAHs, RHTP funds may be consumed maintaining current services rather than enabling genuine transformation. The 1.6% statewide operating margin leaves no cushion for unexpected costs.</p>
<p><strong>Maternity care collapse</strong> has already occurred and cannot be easily reversed. Eleven hospital closures represent permanent capacity loss. RHTP funding can support remaining facilities and expand alternative models, but reopening closed units faces economic realities that transformation dollars alone cannot overcome.</p>
<p><strong>Medicaid cut exposure</strong> threatens the coverage foundation RHTP investments build upon. Work requirements, increased redeterminations, and cost-sharing provisions will reduce Medicaid enrollment, increasing uncompensated care costs and further straining hospital finances. The state&rsquo;s additional requirements beyond federal mandates compound this exposure.</p>
<p><strong>Social care infrastructure gaps</strong> limit the state&rsquo;s ability to address root causes of rural health disparities. Without dedicated investment in CIE platforms, CHW programs, and SDOH coordination, medical system transformation proceeds without the community health infrastructure that determines long-term outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Workforce demographics</strong> work against improvement timelines. Behavioral health practitioners aging out of practice faster than they can be replaced creates a shrinking window for knowledge transfer and succession planning. The five-year RHTP commitment requirements help with retention but cannot accelerate training pipelines.</p>
<p><strong>2030 Sustainability Question</strong></p>
<p>New Hampshire&rsquo;s combination of technical excellence and genuine structural crisis creates a test case for RHTP&rsquo;s theory of change. Can federal investment stabilize a fragile healthcare system during the five-year program period while building capacity for sustainability after funding ends?</p>
<p>The state&rsquo;s affluence provides advantages unavailable elsewhere. Higher income levels mean greater capacity for local funding alternatives, private philanthropy, and employer-sponsored coverage expansion. Economic stability reduces the poverty-driven health disparities that compound healthcare access challenges in other rural states.</p>
<p>Yet affluence has not prevented maternity care collapse, hospital financial distress, or workforce shortages. Market forces alone have proven insufficient to maintain rural healthcare infrastructure in New Hampshire. RHTP funding represents a significant temporary resource, but the structural economics that closed eleven birthing units and put seven hospitals in the red will persist after 2030.</p>
<p>The honest assessment is that New Hampshire&rsquo;s exceptional technical score reflects application quality rather than healthcare system health. The state has correctly identified transformation priorities and designed credible initiatives. Whether those initiatives can overcome structural forces that have been eroding rural healthcare for decades remains uncertain. RHTP provides resources; outcomes depend on implementation and on factors beyond any state&rsquo;s control.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>New Hampshire brings genuine technical sophistication to rural health transformation. The fourth-highest technical score nationally, dedicated governance infrastructure, and strong stakeholder alignment demonstrate state capacity that many rural health systems lack.</p>
<p>Yet the Granite State also brings genuine crisis. Hospital losses, maternity deserts, workforce shortages, and Medicaid vulnerability create headwinds that transformation funding must first overcome before enabling forward progress. The $204 million FY2026 award is the largest in New England but arrives at a healthcare system operating closer to failure than to stability.</p>
<p>GO-NORTH&rsquo;s implementation will reveal whether technical excellence translates to operational impact. The state has positioned itself well; execution now determines whether &ldquo;Granite Strong. Future Ready&rdquo; becomes reality or remains aspiration.</p>
