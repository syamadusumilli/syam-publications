  "articleBody": "Wisconsin received $203.7 million in FY2026 RHTP funding, ranking 23rd among all 50 state awards. The allocation positions Wisconsin slightly above the national average of $200 million, reflecting the state’s substantial rural population and robust healthcare infrastructure despite lacking the extreme rural dispersal that benefited states like Wyoming or Montana.\nThe state’s vision statement captures the transformation approach: “the right providers, empowered by the right technology, and supported by the right networks.” Wisconsin requested $1 billion over five years and may receive up to $18 million above that request according to CMS staff, positioning the dairy state’s rural health system for unprecedented federal investment.\nRural Health Landscape State Context Wisconsin spans 65,496 square miles across 72 counties, with the northern two-thirds of the state comprising predominantly rural territory. The Department of Health Services identifies 2.14 million Wisconsinites living in rural census tracts, representing 36.3% of the state’s 5.9 million population. Rural Wisconsin covers 82% of the state’s total land area but maintains only 48 people per square mile compared to 388 in urban areas.\nMetric Rural Wisconsin Urban Wisconsin Population 2.14 million (36.3%) 3.75 million (63.7%) Land Area 44,496 sq mi (82.1%) 9,672 sq mi (17.9%) Population Density 48.1/sq mi 388.0/sq mi Median Household Income $74,700 $81,800 Uninsured Rate 6% 5% Rural Wisconsin exhibits the income and insurance disparities common to agricultural economies. The $7,100 gap in median household income between rural and urban areas compounds over time, affecting families’ ability to absorb healthcare costs and travel expenses. The higher rural uninsured rate persists despite Wisconsin’s unique Medicaid structure that eliminates the coverage gap present in other non-expansion states.\nEmployment patterns reveal rural Wisconsin’s economic foundation. Manufacturing employs 20% of rural workers compared to 17% in urban areas, while the agricultural sector concentrates almost exclusively in rural counties. The combination of manufacturing and agricultural employment creates occupational health challenges including machinery injuries, respiratory conditions, and chemical exposures that strain healthcare systems designed for lower-acuity populations.\nGeographic Distribution Wisconsin designates 32 counties as rural and 40 as semi-rural for RHTP purposes:\nRural Counties (32): Adams, Ashland, Barron, Buffalo, Burnett, Clark, Crawford, Florence, Forest, Green Lake, Iron, Jackson, Juneau, Lafayette, Langlade, Lincoln, Marinette, Marquette, Menominee, Monroe, Oneida, Pepin, Polk, Portage, Price, Richland, Rusk, Sawyer, Taylor, Vilas, Washburn, Wood\nSemi-Rural Counties (40): Including Bayfield, Brown, Calumet, Chippewa, Columbia, Dane, Dodge, Door, Douglas, Dunn, Eau Claire, Fond du Lac, Grant, Green, Iowa, Jefferson, and others surrounding the Milwaukee metropolitan area.\nNorthern Wisconsin presents the most acute access challenges. Residents in counties like Florence, Forest, and Iron face travel times exceeding 60 minutes for emergency care and limited specialty access. The application notes that two-thirds of rural residents must travel more than 30 minutes to access emergency care, with 35% traveling over 60 minutes for emergency services.\nHealthcare Infrastructure Wisconsin maintains substantial rural healthcare infrastructure relative to population:\nFacility Type Total Semi-Rural Rural FQHCs/Community Health Centers 280 156 (55%) 80 (28%) Critical Access Hospitals 60 32 (53%) 28 (46%) Rural Health Clinics 217 105 (48%) 112 (51%) Free and Charitable Clinics 102 72 (70%) 8 (7%) Tribal Clinics 14 4 (28%) 9 (64%) Opioid Treatment Facilities 31 22 (70%) 0 (0%) Local and Tribal Health Departments 84 43 (51%) 31 (36%) EMS Agencies 762 84% rural or semi-rural The 60 Critical Access Hospitals anchor emergency and inpatient care across rural Wisconsin. Notably, 11 received recognition in the 2025 HRSA Medicare Beneficiary Quality Improvement Project for quality reporting and performance, ranking Wisconsin’s CAHs among the top 10 nationally. The Wisconsin Office of Rural Health Flex Program supports CAH quality improvement, financial improvement, and operational activities.\nThe absence of opioid treatment facilities in fully rural counties creates a treatment desert for substance use disorders. The 31 existing facilities concentrate in semi-rural and urban areas, forcing rural residents to travel substantial distances for medication-assisted treatment.\nThe 2024 Hospital Closures The fragility of Wisconsin’s rural healthcare infrastructure became starkly visible in January 2024 when Hospital Sisters Health System (HSHS) announced complete withdrawal from western Wisconsin. The closures included:\nSacred Heart Hospital in Eau Claire, serving patients since the 1880s St. Joseph’s Hospital in Chippewa Falls 19 Prevea Health clinics across the Chippewa Valley\nThe closures eliminated emergency rooms, hospital beds, and critical care units while devastating behavioral health services in the region. Sacred Heart had provided inpatient and outpatient behavioral health services that no other facility in the immediate area could absorb. Over 1,000 healthcare workers lost employment.\nEven a $15 million state appropriation for behavioral health services could not save the facilities. Wisconsin Hospital Association President Eric Borgerding noted that “even with the $15 million in one-time funding, they could not afford to operate the services there.” The facilities’ payor mix of two-thirds Medicare and Medicaid proved unsustainable under current reimbursement rates.\nThe closures provided visceral context for Wisconsin’s RHTP application. DHS Secretary Kirsten Johnson explicitly referenced the closure impact: “In 2024, two hospitals closed in adjoining counties, leaving patients to find new providers and other facilities to absorb patients.”\nHealth Professional Shortages Wisconsin faces workforce gaps across multiple provider categories:\nDesignation Type Affected Counties Mental Health Professional Shortage 40 of 72 counties Primary Care Shortage 37 of 72 counties Dental Care Shortage 34 of 72 counties The 56% of counties designated as mental health shortage areas creates cascading effects. Rural residents experience higher suicide rates (17.0 versus 14.2 deaths per 100,000), higher self-harm injury rates in emergency departments, and fewer depression screenings during primary care visits. Rural men over age 25 face particularly elevated suicide risk, especially during summer months when agricultural stress peaks.\nThe Wisconsin Governor’s Task Force on the Healthcare Workforce documented recruitment and retention challenges in its 2024 report. Rural communities struggle to attract providers due to geographic isolation, limited family-supporting services, and technology gaps that create administrative burdens. Students who train in rural settings demonstrate higher likelihood of practicing rurally, but connecting students to rural training opportunities remains difficult.\nHealth Outcomes Rural Wisconsin exhibits the chronic disease burden common to agricultural states:\nCondition Rural Impact Heart Disease Mortality (35+) 335.5 vs 324.2 deaths/100,000 (rural vs urban) Cardiac Arrest Ambulance Runs 14.3 vs 12.3 per 10,000 (rural vs urban) Diabetes Prevalence ~9% statewide Suicide Rate 17.0 vs 14.2 deaths/100,000 (rural vs urban) Self-Harm ED Visits 64.8 vs 51.8 per 100,000 (rural vs urban) Prenatal care disparities compound maternal health risks. Only 75% of rural mothers received first-trimester prenatal care compared to 78% in urban counties. Severe maternal morbidity reached 77.9 per 10,000 delivery hospitalizations in 2023, with pregnancy-related overdose deaths emerging as the leading cause of pregnancy-related death.\nFarmer mental health presents particular urgency. Surveys indicate 80% of farmers report financial issues impacting mental health, 82% cite weather or factors beyond their control, and 80% identify farm economy concerns. Wisconsin Farm Bureau and the Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection operate farmer wellness programs, but coverage remains limited.\nRHTP Award and Context Metric Wisconsin National Context FY2026 Award $203.7 million Average: $200 million Award Rank 23rd of 50 Range: $147M to $281M Five-Year Projection ~$1 billion Based on CMS guidance Rural Population 2.14 million 36.3% of state Per-Capita (Rural) ~$95 Below many smaller states CAHs 60 Second-tier density Formula Position Wisconsin’s position near the national average reflects offsetting formula factors:\nFavorable: Substantial rural population (2.14 million), extensive CAH network (60), strong application with specific initiatives, Medicaid structure eliminating coverage gap\nUnfavorable: Population density higher than frontier states, moderate rurality scores compared to Northern Plains states, lack of Medicaid expansion limits scoring on coverage factors\nThe $95 per-capita rural funding falls below frontier states like Wyoming ($554) or Montana ($234) but exceeds dense states where rural populations represent smaller shares. Wisconsin cannot achieve the per-resident investment intensity of smaller states, but the absolute funding level enables statewide program implementation.\nMedicaid Context Wisconsin represents the only non-expansion state without a coverage gap. Under the BadgerCare Plus structure established by former Governor Scott Walker:\nAdults up to 100% FPL: Covered through BadgerCare Plus waiver Adults 100% to 138% FPL: Access premium tax credits in the Marketplace (unlike other non-expansion states) Childless Adults: 198,000 enrolled as of January 2025\nThis unique structure means Wisconsin’s rural residents have coverage pathways unavailable in other non-expansion states like Texas or Georgia. However, the state forgoes approximately $1.9 billion in federal matching funds that full Medicaid expansion would provide, while paying a higher state share (39.9%) for the waiver population than the 10% state share expansion states pay.\nGovernor Evers has proposed Medicaid expansion in four consecutive biennial budgets, with Republican legislative majorities blocking each attempt. The Wisconsin Policy Forum estimates expansion would save $1.7 billion over the biennium, including a $1.3 billion federal sign-on bonus.\nWork Requirements: Federal policy changes beginning January 2027 will require community engagement for Medicaid adults, potentially affecting coverage continuity for rural Wisconsinites already enrolled in BadgerCare Plus.\nState Approach Governance Structure The Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) Office of Grants Management (OGM) serves as lead agency. OGM will recruit a dedicated team including:\nRHTP Program Director Program Managers for policy and grants administration Analysts for program development, grants management, data analytics DHS holds authority over Medicaid, public health, behavioral health, and regulation of hospital and long-term care sectors. The Office of Tribal Affairs and Wisconsin Office of Rural Health provide specialized coordination for Tribal engagement and rural health expertise.\nAn external advisory body will meet at least quarterly, incorporating:\nRural hospitals and Tribal health centers Community health centers Primary and behavioral health providers Community-based care extenders (CHWs, peer specialists, pharmacists, EMS) Higher education partners Individuals with lived experience Three-Initiative Architecture Wisconsin’s application organizes funding across three interconnected initiatives totaling approximately $944 million over five years:\nInitiative Allocation Share 1: Rural Talent Recruitment and Retention $337 million 36% 2: Interoperability Infrastructure and Modernization $329 million 35% 3: Population Health Infrastructure $278.5 million 30% Program and Funding Distribution Program Initiative Allocation Implementing Organization Focus Rural Workforce Grants 1 $150 million Dept. of Workforce Development Regional workforce innovation Community Health Worker Integration 1 $60 million DHS/Medicaid CHW pilot, Medicaid SPA Workforce Readiness (Education) 1 $127 million AHEC, DPI, UW, WTCS, MCW, Marquette Training pipelines Rural Technology Transformation Fund 2 $205 million Rural facilities Technology adoption Rural Health Care Collaborative 2 $85 million TBD Vendor Shared digital backbone Dental Technology Grants 2 $10 million DHS/OGM Efficient cleaning tech Public Navigation Transformation 2 $29 million CIE/HIE, DOA, DATCP, DVA Customer service upgrades Care Coordination Grants 3 $230 million Regional coalitions Innovative care delivery Tribal Allocations 3 $27.5 million 11 Tribal Nations $500K/year per nation Medicaid Reforms 3 ~$15 million Wisconsin Medicaid RHC payment modernization Public Intervenor Services 3 $15 million Office of Insurance Commissioner Insurance navigation Behavioral Health Innovations 3 $5 million DHS/DCTS CCBHC study, youth mental health Social Care Integration Component Included Allocation Vendor/Operator Likely Funded SDOH/HRSN Screening Embedded Not specified Care Coordination Grantees At Risk CHW Programs Yes $60 million Medicaid/Pilot Grantees Yes CIE Platform Yes $4 million United Way Wisconsin (211) Yes HIE Infrastructure Yes $2 million WISHIN Yes Rural Health Care Collaborative Yes $85 million TBD Vendor Yes Community Health Worker Integration Wisconsin’s CHW initiative represents the most explicitly sustainable social care investment in the application. The phased approach includes:\n2026-2027: Competitive grants for rural facilities to pilot CHW services 2026-2028: Independent study of utilization, cost, impact, and ROI 2028: Medicaid State Plan Amendment to cover CHW services\nThe application cites Kentucky’s CHW program demonstrating $11.33 return for every $1 spent over 25 years, with 10% reduction in ER visits and 23% reduction in inpatient admissions. Wisconsin expects similar returns will encourage private and public payors to cover services.\nThree nationally certified CHW training programs operate in Wisconsin, providing virtual and in-person core competency training. The Wisconsin Association of Community Health Workers provides peer-to-peer learning and supervisor development.\nCommunity Information Exchange United Way Wisconsin operates the 211 system serving as the statewide CIE backbone. RHTP investment will enhance the database of approximately 12,000 agencies, improve closed-loop referral capabilities, and strengthen connections between community-based organizations and clinical providers.\nWISHIN (Wisconsin Statewide Health Information Network) serves as the state-designated HIE. Investment will improve interoperability between rural providers and support clinical data exchange for the Rural Health Care Collaborative.\nRural Health Care Collaborative The most ambitious technology investment, the $85 million Rural Health Care Collaborative will create shared digital infrastructure enabling smaller rural providers to:\nAccess comprehensive longitudinal patient records Deploy chronic disease management tools Utilize patient-facing portals Access telehealth services and expanded care networks Implement closed-loop community service referral networks Adopt AI charting, medication management, remote patient monitoring Technical specifications will be developed with participating providers. Sustainability will be achieved through user fees for ongoing maintenance. DHS projects 60+ providers at 5+ care sites enrolled by Year 4.\nKey Subawardees State Agency Partners Agency Role Allocation Area Department of Workforce Development Rural workforce grants administration $150 million Department of Public Instruction K-12 health science pathways Part of $127 million University of Wisconsin System Clinical training, simulation labs Part of $127 million WI Technical College System Allied health programs Part of $127 million Medical College of Wisconsin WISCOPE teleconsultation Part of $127 million Marquette University Rural dental residency Part of $127 million DATCP Farmer Wellness Program Part of $29 million Dept. of Veterans Affairs Telehealth rooms Part of $29 million Dept. of Administration Integrated state platform Part of $29 million Office of Insurance Commissioner Public intervenor services $15 million Academic and Technical Assistance Partners Area Health Education Centers (AHEC): Seven regional centers serving 7,000+ learners annually with 500+ field placements at 131 clinical sites.

The state will assign staff to ensure alignment with CMS-approved goals while respecting government-to-government relationships.\nAssessment Strengths Sustainability Planning: Wisconsin’s CHW Medicaid SPA pathway creates the clearest post-RHTP funding stream for social care integration in any reviewed application. If successful, CHW services become permanent Medicaid benefits rather than grant-dependent programs.\nTechnology Strategy: The Rural Health Care Collaborative addresses the fundamental interoperability gap preventing coordinated rural care. Smaller providers operating with “bubble gum and duct tape” (per one county cited in the application) cannot individually afford modern systems. Shared infrastructure creates economies of scale.\nExisting Infrastructure: The 60 CAHs, 217 RHCs, and 280 FQHCs provide implementation platforms that states lacking provider density cannot replicate. Wisconsin can reach rural populations through existing access points rather than building from scratch.\nQuality Recognition: Wisconsin CAHs rank among the top 10 nationally for HRSA MBQIP performance. The 65% of Wisconsin hospitals earning CMS four or five-star ratings (versus 36% nationally) indicates existing quality foundation for transformation.\nCoverage Structure: No coverage gap means RHTP investments serve populations who can actually access care. Unlike Texas or Georgia, Wisconsin’s rural uninsured rate remains manageable.\nHospital Investment: The 2025 state budget provided significant ongoing hospital investment, with a hospital tax increase from 1.8% to 6% generating approximately $1 billion in additional federal matching funds annually.\nVulnerabilities SDOH Specificity: The application lacks explicit SDOH screening requirements at the provider level. Social care integration depends on care coordination grantee implementation rather than systematic mandates. CHW services are the vehicle, but screening infrastructure receives limited attention.\nVendor Procurement Risk: The Rural Health Care Collaborative requires vendor selection for complex shared infrastructure. Implementation timelines (20-40 providers added every six months through 2031) assume procurement proceeds smoothly, which large IT projects rarely do.\nBehavioral Health Capacity: The CCBHC study is prudent but delays action. While Wisconsin studies how to structure Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics, the behavioral health provider shortage persists. The $5 million behavioral health allocation seems modest relative to documented crisis.\nHospital Closure Precedent: The HSHS closures demonstrated that even $15 million in emergency state funding could not sustain facilities with challenging payor mix. RHTP investment cannot solve fundamental hospital economics where two-thirds of patients rely on government programs reimbursing below cost.\nNon-Expansion Trade-offs: Wisconsin pays 39.9% state share for the BadgerCare waiver population versus 10% under expansion. The $1.9 billion forgone savings over the biennium represents resources unavailable for provider investment, workforce recruitment, or facility support.\nWorkforce Competition: Wisconsin competes with Minnesota (which has expanded Medicaid, offers higher reimbursement, and maintains stronger rural health outcomes) for healthcare workers. Providers can practice across state lines with different payment structures.\nThe 2030 Question Wisconsin’s application explicitly addresses sustainability through several mechanisms:\nOne-Time Investments: Educational initiatives, simulation labs, technology purchases, and system upgrades are designed as capital expenditures without ongoing federal dependence.\nUser Fee Models: The Rural Health Care Collaborative will transition to participant-funded maintenance. Facilities accepting technology allocations commit to sustaining operations.\nMedicaid Coverage: CHW services achieve sustainability through State Plan Amendment rather than ongoing grant funding.\nPartnership Requirements: Care coordination grantees must demonstrate sustainability paths for proposed projects.\nHowever, fundamental questions remain:\nCan workforce recruited through RHTP training remain in rural Wisconsin without ongoing incentives? Students may complete training but practice elsewhere if rural economics remain challenging.\nWill technology investments prove sustainable for facilities with difficult payor mix? Facilities like those HSHS closed operated modern systems but could not generate sufficient revenue.\nDoes partial-year CHW pilot (2026-2027) provide sufficient evidence for Medicaid SPA approval? CMS may require longer demonstration periods before approving ongoing coverage.\nThe Medicaid Math Factor Impact RHTP Five-Year Investment +$1 billion Hospital Tax Revenue Increase +$1 billion annually Medicaid Expansion Forgone -$1.9 billion per biennium Federal Work Requirements (2027+) Unknown coverage impact Projected Medicaid Cuts (Federal) Varies by formula Wisconsin’s position is paradoxical. The state invests substantial RHTP resources while simultaneously forgoing larger federal Medicaid investment. The hospital tax increase demonstrates willingness to fund healthcare, yet the same political structure blocks expansion that would reduce state costs.\nRHTP cannot substitute for Medicaid expansion economics. The $1 billion RHTP investment over five years represents roughly half the biennial savings expansion would generate. Transformation built on constrained coverage cannot achieve the outcomes available to expansion states.\nConclusion Wisconsin’s $203.7 million FY2026 award validates an application built on genuine infrastructure strengths: 60 Critical Access Hospitals, extensive provider networks, established academic partnerships, and a coverage structure unique among non-expansion states. The three-initiative architecture addresses workforce, technology, and care delivery through interconnected investments rather than isolated programs.\nThe CHW Medicaid SPA pathway represents the clearest sustainability mechanism for social care integration in any Series 3 state analysis. If Wisconsin achieves 2028 Medicaid coverage for CHW services, the model demonstrates how federal transformation investment can create permanent coverage categories rather than temporary programs.\nThe Rural Health Care Collaborative addresses technology gaps that prevent coordinated care. Smaller facilities cannot individually afford modern systems, but shared infrastructure creates economies of scale unavailable through facility-by-facility investment.\nYet context constrains optimism. The 2024 HSHS closures demonstrated that well-intentioned state investment cannot overcome fundamental hospital economics. Facilities serving predominantly Medicare and Medicaid populations cannot survive under current reimbursement structures regardless of technology upgrades or workforce programs.\nWisconsin’s political trajectory affects transformation prospects more than RHTP investments themselves. Four consecutive gubernatorial proposals for Medicaid expansion have failed. The state forgoes billions in federal matching while investing hundreds of millions in RHTP. This represents fiscal choice, not fiscal necessity, with implications for provider sustainability that transformation investment cannot resolve.\nFor Wisconsin’s 2.14 million rural residents, RHTP represents unprecedented investment in a healthcare infrastructure that recent experience proves fragile. The question is whether workforce, technology, and care coordination investments can strengthen the economic foundation, or whether they build capacity atop financial instability that claims another hospital before 2030.\nWisconsin has a plan. Whether Wisconsin’s political context permits the plan to succeed is another question entirely.\nCross-References RHTP 2A: RHTP Structure and Rules RHTP 2B: Medicaid Architecture and the $911B Question RHTP 2H: The 2030 Cliff RHTP 3.IA: Iowa (regional comparison) RHTP 3.MN: Minnesota (regional comparison) RHTP 3.MI: Michigan (regional comparison) RHTP 4B: Workforce Recruitment and Retention RHTP 4C: Telehealth and Virtual Care RHTP 4D: Community Health Workers RHTP 4H: Social Needs Integration Sources Baldwin, Tammy. “Senator Baldwin Introduces HSHS Act to Protect Communities from Hospital Closures.” U.S. Senate, 2024, www.baldwin.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-baldwin-introduces-hshs-act-to-protect-communities-from-hospital-closures.\nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services. “CMS Announces $50 Billion in Awards to Strengthen Rural Health in All 50 States.” CMS Newsroom, 29 Dec. 2025, www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-announces-50-billion-awards-strengthen-rural-health-all-50-states.\nChief Healthcare Executive. “Wisconsin Hospital Association CEO Discusses Hospital Closures and Financial Woes.” Chief Healthcare Executive, Sept. 2025, www.chiefhealthcareexecutive.com/view/wisconsin-hospital-association-president-discusses-hospital-closures-financial-woes-and-more.\nHealth Management Associates. “CMS Announces Rural Health Transformation Program Awardees.” HMA, Jan. 2026, www.healthmanagement.com/blog/cms-announces-rural-health-transformation-program-awardees/.\nHealthinsurance.org. “Medicaid Eligibility and Enrollment in Wisconsin.” Healthinsurance.org, Nov. 2025, www.healthinsurance.org/medicaid/wisconsin/.\nKaiser Family Foundation. “Status of State Medicaid Expansion Decisions.” KFF, Jan. 2026, www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/status-of-state-medicaid-expansion-decisions.\nPublic Health Watch. “Amid Potential Cuts, Push for Medicaid Expansion in Wisconsin Continues.” Public Health Watch, May 2025, publichealthwatch.org/2025/05/29/amid-potential-cuts-push-for-medicaid-expansion-in-wisconsin-continues/.\nWisconsin Department of Health Services. “DHS Applies for $1 Billion in Federal Funding to Expand Access to High Quality Health Services in Rural Wisconsin.” DHS News, Nov. 2025, www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/news/releases/110625.htm.\nWisconsin Department of Health Services. “Harnessing Innovation and Strengthening Partnerships: Building a Healthier Future for Rural Wisconsin.” DHS RHTP Application, Nov. 2025, www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/business/dhs-rhtp-application-narrative.pdf.\nWisconsin Department of Health Services. “Rural Health Transformation Program.” DHS, Jan. 2026, www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/business/rhtp.htm.\nWisconsin Hospital Association. “CMS Awards Wisconsin $203 Million in Rural Health Transformation Funds for 2026.” WHA Newsletter, 30 Dec. 2025, www.wha.org/news/newsletters/2025/12-30-2025/1.\nWisconsin Independent. “Rural Communities in Western Wisconsin Face Closure of 2 Hospitals, 19 Clinics.” Wisconsin Independent, Jan. 2024, wisconsinindependent.com/politics/rural-communities-western-wisconsin-closure-hospitals-clinics/.\nWisconsin Office of Rural Health. “Hospitals.” WORH, 2025, worh.org/resources/health-care/hospitals/.\nWisconsin Watch. “Wisconsin Still Losing Out from Not Expanding Medicaid.” Wisconsin Watch, July 2025, wisconsinwatch.org/2025/07/wisconsin-medicaid-funding-trump-budget-work-requirements-big-bill/.\nRHTP 3.WI: Wisconsin Series 3: State Implementation Rural Health Transformation Project Version 3: January 2026\n",

</div>

<p>Wisconsin received <strong>$203.7 million in FY2026 RHTP funding</strong>, ranking 23rd among all 50 state awards. The allocation positions Wisconsin slightly above the national average of $200 million, reflecting the state&rsquo;s substantial rural population and robust healthcare infrastructure despite lacking the extreme rural dispersal that benefited states like Wyoming or Montana.</p>
<p>The state&rsquo;s vision statement captures the transformation approach: &ldquo;the right providers, empowered by the right technology, and supported by the right networks.&rdquo; Wisconsin requested <strong>$1 billion over five years</strong> and may receive up to $18 million above that request according to CMS staff, positioning the dairy state&rsquo;s rural health system for unprecedented federal investment.</p>

<p>Wisconsin spans <strong>65,496 square miles</strong> across 72 counties, with the northern two-thirds of the state comprising predominantly rural territory. The Department of Health Services identifies <strong>2.14 million Wisconsinites living in rural census tracts</strong>, representing <strong>36.3% of the state&rsquo;s 5.9 million population</strong>. Rural Wisconsin covers 82% of the state&rsquo;s total land area but maintains only 48 people per square mile compared to 388 in urban areas.</p>

<p>Rural Wisconsin exhibits the income and insurance disparities common to agricultural economies. The $7,100 gap in median household income between rural and urban areas compounds over time, affecting families&rsquo; ability to absorb healthcare costs and travel expenses. The higher rural uninsured rate persists despite Wisconsin&rsquo;s unique Medicaid structure that eliminates the coverage gap present in other non-expansion states.</p>
<p>Employment patterns reveal rural Wisconsin&rsquo;s economic foundation. <strong>Manufacturing employs 20% of rural workers</strong> compared to 17% in urban areas, while the agricultural sector concentrates almost exclusively in rural counties. The combination of manufacturing and agricultural employment creates occupational health challenges including machinery injuries, respiratory conditions, and chemical exposures that strain healthcare systems designed for lower-acuity populations.</p>

<p>Wisconsin designates 32 counties as rural and 40 as semi-rural for RHTP purposes:</p>
<p><strong>Rural Counties (32):</strong> Adams, Ashland, Barron, Buffalo, Burnett, Clark, Crawford, Florence, Forest, Green Lake, Iron, Jackson, Juneau, Lafayette, Langlade, Lincoln, Marinette, Marquette, Menominee, Monroe, Oneida, Pepin, Polk, Portage, Price, Richland, Rusk, Sawyer, Taylor, Vilas, Washburn, Wood</p>
<p><strong>Semi-Rural Counties (40):</strong> Including Bayfield, Brown, Calumet, Chippewa, Columbia, Dane, Dodge, Door, Douglas, Dunn, Eau Claire, Fond du Lac, Grant, Green, Iowa, Jefferson, and others surrounding the Milwaukee metropolitan area.</p>
<p>Northern Wisconsin presents the most acute access challenges. Residents in counties like Florence, Forest, and Iron face <strong>travel times exceeding 60 minutes for emergency care</strong> and limited specialty access. The application notes that two-thirds of rural residents must travel more than 30 minutes to access emergency care, with 35% traveling over 60 minutes for emergency services.</p>

<p>The <strong>60 Critical Access Hospitals</strong> anchor emergency and inpatient care across rural Wisconsin. Notably, 11 received recognition in the 2025 HRSA Medicare Beneficiary Quality Improvement Project for quality reporting and performance, ranking Wisconsin&rsquo;s CAHs among the top 10 nationally. The <strong>Wisconsin Office of Rural Health Flex Program</strong> supports CAH quality improvement, financial improvement, and operational activities.</p>
<p>The <strong>absence of opioid treatment facilities in fully rural counties</strong> creates a treatment desert for substance use disorders. The 31 existing facilities concentrate in semi-rural and urban areas, forcing rural residents to travel substantial distances for medication-assisted treatment.</p>
<h3 id="the-2024-hospital-closures">The 2024 Hospital Closures<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-2024-hospital-closures">#</a></h3>
<p>The fragility of Wisconsin&rsquo;s rural healthcare infrastructure became starkly visible in January 2024 when <strong>Hospital Sisters Health System (HSHS) announced complete withdrawal from western Wisconsin</strong>. The closures included:</p>
<p><strong>Sacred Heart Hospital</strong> in Eau Claire, serving patients since the 1880s
<strong>St. Joseph&rsquo;s Hospital</strong> in Chippewa Falls
<strong>19 Prevea Health clinics</strong> across the Chippewa Valley</p>
<p>The closures eliminated emergency rooms, hospital beds, and critical care units while devastating behavioral health services in the region. Sacred Heart had provided <strong>inpatient and outpatient behavioral health services</strong> that no other facility in the immediate area could absorb. Over 1,000 healthcare workers lost employment.</p>
<p>Even a $15 million state appropriation for behavioral health services could not save the facilities. Wisconsin Hospital Association President Eric Borgerding noted that &ldquo;even with the $15 million in one-time funding, they could not afford to operate the services there.&rdquo; The facilities&rsquo; payor mix of two-thirds Medicare and Medicaid proved unsustainable under current reimbursement rates.</p>
<p>The closures provided visceral context for Wisconsin&rsquo;s RHTP application. DHS Secretary Kirsten Johnson explicitly referenced the closure impact: &ldquo;In 2024, two hospitals closed in adjoining counties, leaving patients to find new providers and other facilities to absorb patients.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The <strong>56% of counties designated as mental health shortage areas</strong> creates cascading effects. Rural residents experience higher suicide rates (17.0 versus 14.2 deaths per 100,000), higher self-harm injury rates in emergency departments, and fewer depression screenings during primary care visits. Rural men over age 25 face particularly elevated suicide risk, especially during summer months when agricultural stress peaks.</p>
<p>The <strong>Wisconsin Governor&rsquo;s Task Force on the Healthcare Workforce</strong> documented recruitment and retention challenges in its 2024 report. Rural communities struggle to attract providers due to geographic isolation, limited family-supporting services, and technology gaps that create administrative burdens. Students who train in rural settings demonstrate higher likelihood of practicing rurally, but connecting students to rural training opportunities remains difficult.</p>

<p>Prenatal care disparities compound maternal health risks. Only <strong>75% of rural mothers received first-trimester prenatal care</strong> compared to 78% in urban counties. Severe maternal morbidity reached 77.9 per 10,000 delivery hospitalizations in 2023, with pregnancy-related overdose deaths emerging as the leading cause of pregnancy-related death.</p>
<p><strong>Farmer mental health</strong> presents particular urgency. Surveys indicate 80% of farmers report financial issues impacting mental health, 82% cite weather or factors beyond their control, and 80% identify farm economy concerns. Wisconsin Farm Bureau and the Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection operate farmer wellness programs, but coverage remains limited.</p>

<h3 id="formula-position">Formula Position<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#formula-position">#</a></h3>
<p>Wisconsin&rsquo;s position near the national average reflects offsetting formula factors:</p>
<p><strong>Favorable:</strong> Substantial rural population (2.14 million), extensive CAH network (60), strong application with specific initiatives, Medicaid structure eliminating coverage gap</p>
<p><strong>Unfavorable:</strong> Population density higher than frontier states, moderate rurality scores compared to Northern Plains states, lack of Medicaid expansion limits scoring on coverage factors</p>
<p>The <strong>$95 per-capita rural funding</strong> falls below frontier states like Wyoming ($554) or Montana ($234) but exceeds dense states where rural populations represent smaller shares. Wisconsin cannot achieve the per-resident investment intensity of smaller states, but the absolute funding level enables statewide program implementation.</p>
<h3 id="medicaid-context">Medicaid Context<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#medicaid-context">#</a></h3>
<p>Wisconsin represents <strong>the only non-expansion state without a coverage gap</strong>. Under the BadgerCare Plus structure established by former Governor Scott Walker:</p>
<p><strong>Adults up to 100% FPL:</strong> Covered through BadgerCare Plus waiver
<strong>Adults 100% to 138% FPL:</strong> Access premium tax credits in the Marketplace (unlike other non-expansion states)
<strong>Childless Adults:</strong> 198,000 enrolled as of January 2025</p>
<p>This unique structure means Wisconsin&rsquo;s rural residents have coverage pathways unavailable in other non-expansion states like Texas or Georgia. However, the state forgoes approximately <strong>$1.9 billion in federal matching funds</strong> that full Medicaid expansion would provide, while paying a higher state share (39.9%) for the waiver population than the 10% state share expansion states pay.</p>
<p>Governor Evers has proposed Medicaid expansion in four consecutive biennial budgets, with Republican legislative majorities blocking each attempt. The Wisconsin Policy Forum estimates expansion would save $1.7 billion over the biennium, including a $1.3 billion federal sign-on bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Work Requirements:</strong> Federal policy changes beginning January 2027 will require community engagement for Medicaid adults, potentially affecting coverage continuity for rural Wisconsinites already enrolled in BadgerCare Plus.</p>

<p>Wisconsin&rsquo;s CHW initiative represents the <strong>most explicitly sustainable social care investment</strong> in the application. The phased approach includes:</p>
<p><strong>2026-2027:</strong> Competitive grants for rural facilities to pilot CHW services
<strong>2026-2028:</strong> Independent study of utilization, cost, impact, and ROI
<strong>2028:</strong> Medicaid State Plan Amendment to cover CHW services</p>
<p>The application cites Kentucky&rsquo;s CHW program demonstrating <strong>$11.33 return for every $1 spent</strong> over 25 years, with 10% reduction in ER visits and 23% reduction in inpatient admissions. Wisconsin expects similar returns will encourage private and public payors to cover services.</p>
<p>Three nationally certified CHW training programs operate in Wisconsin, providing virtual and in-person core competency training. The Wisconsin Association of Community Health Workers provides peer-to-peer learning and supervisor development.</p>

<h2 id="assessment">Assessment<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#assessment">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="strengths">Strengths<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#strengths">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Sustainability Planning:</strong> Wisconsin&rsquo;s CHW Medicaid SPA pathway creates the clearest post-RHTP funding stream for social care integration in any reviewed application. If successful, CHW services become permanent Medicaid benefits rather than grant-dependent programs.</p>
<p><strong>Technology Strategy:</strong> The Rural Health Care Collaborative addresses the fundamental interoperability gap preventing coordinated rural care. Smaller providers operating with &ldquo;bubble gum and duct tape&rdquo; (per one county cited in the application) cannot individually afford modern systems. Shared infrastructure creates economies of scale.</p>
<p><strong>Existing Infrastructure:</strong> The 60 CAHs, 217 RHCs, and 280 FQHCs provide implementation platforms that states lacking provider density cannot replicate. Wisconsin can reach rural populations through existing access points rather than building from scratch.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Recognition:</strong> Wisconsin CAHs rank among the top 10 nationally for HRSA MBQIP performance. The 65% of Wisconsin hospitals earning CMS four or five-star ratings (versus 36% nationally) indicates existing quality foundation for transformation.</p>
<p><strong>Coverage Structure:</strong> No coverage gap means RHTP investments serve populations who can actually access care. Unlike Texas or Georgia, Wisconsin&rsquo;s rural uninsured rate remains manageable.</p>
<p><strong>Hospital Investment:</strong> The 2025 state budget provided significant ongoing hospital investment, with a hospital tax increase from 1.8% to 6% generating approximately $1 billion in additional federal matching funds annually.</p>
<h3 id="vulnerabilities">Vulnerabilities<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#vulnerabilities">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>SDOH Specificity:</strong> The application lacks explicit SDOH screening requirements at the provider level. Social care integration depends on care coordination grantee implementation rather than systematic mandates. CHW services are the vehicle, but screening infrastructure receives limited attention.</p>
<p><strong>Vendor Procurement Risk:</strong> The Rural Health Care Collaborative requires vendor selection for complex shared infrastructure. Implementation timelines (20-40 providers added every six months through 2031) assume procurement proceeds smoothly, which large IT projects rarely do.</p>
<p><strong>Behavioral Health Capacity:</strong> The CCBHC study is prudent but delays action. While Wisconsin studies how to structure Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics, the behavioral health provider shortage persists. The $5 million behavioral health allocation seems modest relative to documented crisis.</p>
<p><strong>Hospital Closure Precedent:</strong> The HSHS closures demonstrated that even $15 million in emergency state funding could not sustain facilities with challenging payor mix. RHTP investment cannot solve fundamental hospital economics where two-thirds of patients rely on government programs reimbursing below cost.</p>
<p><strong>Non-Expansion Trade-offs:</strong> Wisconsin pays 39.9% state share for the BadgerCare waiver population versus 10% under expansion. The $1.9 billion forgone savings over the biennium represents resources unavailable for provider investment, workforce recruitment, or facility support.</p>
<p><strong>Workforce Competition:</strong> Wisconsin competes with Minnesota (which has expanded Medicaid, offers higher reimbursement, and maintains stronger rural health outcomes) for healthcare workers. Providers can practice across state lines with different payment structures.</p>
<h3 id="the-2030-question">The 2030 Question<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-2030-question">#</a></h3>
<p>Wisconsin&rsquo;s application explicitly addresses sustainability through several mechanisms:</p>
<p><strong>One-Time Investments:</strong> Educational initiatives, simulation labs, technology purchases, and system upgrades are designed as capital expenditures without ongoing federal dependence.</p>
<p><strong>User Fee Models:</strong> The Rural Health Care Collaborative will transition to participant-funded maintenance. Facilities accepting technology allocations commit to sustaining operations.</p>
<p><strong>Medicaid Coverage:</strong> CHW services achieve sustainability through State Plan Amendment rather than ongoing grant funding.</p>
<p><strong>Partnership Requirements:</strong> Care coordination grantees must demonstrate sustainability paths for proposed projects.</p>
<p>However, fundamental questions remain:</p>
<p><strong>Can workforce recruited through RHTP training remain in rural Wisconsin without ongoing incentives?</strong> Students may complete training but practice elsewhere if rural economics remain challenging.</p>
<p><strong>Will technology investments prove sustainable for facilities with difficult payor mix?</strong> Facilities like those HSHS closed operated modern systems but could not generate sufficient revenue.</p>
<p><strong>Does partial-year CHW pilot (2026-2027) provide sufficient evidence for Medicaid SPA approval?</strong> CMS may require longer demonstration periods before approving ongoing coverage.</p>

<p>Wisconsin&rsquo;s position is paradoxical. The state invests substantial RHTP resources while simultaneously forgoing larger federal Medicaid investment. The hospital tax increase demonstrates willingness to fund healthcare, yet the same political structure blocks expansion that would reduce state costs.</p>
<p><strong>RHTP cannot substitute for Medicaid expansion economics.</strong> The $1 billion RHTP investment over five years represents roughly half the biennial savings expansion would generate. Transformation built on constrained coverage cannot achieve the outcomes available to expansion states.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>Wisconsin&rsquo;s $203.7 million FY2026 award validates an application built on genuine infrastructure strengths: 60 Critical Access Hospitals, extensive provider networks, established academic partnerships, and a coverage structure unique among non-expansion states. The <strong>three-initiative architecture</strong> addresses workforce, technology, and care delivery through interconnected investments rather than isolated programs.</p>
<p>The <strong>CHW Medicaid SPA pathway</strong> represents the clearest sustainability mechanism for social care integration in any Series 3 state analysis. If Wisconsin achieves 2028 Medicaid coverage for CHW services, the model demonstrates how federal transformation investment can create permanent coverage categories rather than temporary programs.</p>
<p>The <strong>Rural Health Care Collaborative</strong> addresses technology gaps that prevent coordinated care. Smaller facilities cannot individually afford modern systems, but shared infrastructure creates economies of scale unavailable through facility-by-facility investment.</p>
<p>Yet context constrains optimism. The <strong>2024 HSHS closures</strong> demonstrated that well-intentioned state investment cannot overcome fundamental hospital economics. Facilities serving predominantly Medicare and Medicaid populations cannot survive under current reimbursement structures regardless of technology upgrades or workforce programs.</p>
<p>Wisconsin&rsquo;s political trajectory affects transformation prospects more than RHTP investments themselves. Four consecutive gubernatorial proposals for Medicaid expansion have failed. The state forgoes billions in federal matching while investing hundreds of millions in RHTP. This represents <strong>fiscal choice, not fiscal necessity</strong>, with implications for provider sustainability that transformation investment cannot resolve.</p>
<p>For Wisconsin&rsquo;s 2.14 million rural residents, RHTP represents unprecedented investment in a healthcare infrastructure that recent experience proves fragile. The question is whether workforce, technology, and care coordination investments can strengthen the economic foundation, or whether they build capacity atop financial instability that claims another hospital before 2030.</p>
<p><strong>Wisconsin has a plan. Whether Wisconsin&rsquo;s political context permits the plan to succeed is another question entirely.</strong></p>
