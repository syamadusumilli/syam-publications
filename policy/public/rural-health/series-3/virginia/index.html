  "articleBody": "A Medicaid expansion state where prosperous Northern Virginia and struggling Appalachian coalfield counties share borders but not health outcomes, Virginia’s VA Rural Vitality plan pursues telehealth expansion and workforce development as Southwest and Southside providers brace for federal cuts that threaten institutions only recently stabilized.\nIntroduction Virginia’s $189.5 million FY2026 RHTP award reflects modest competitive scoring for a state whose 1.07 million rural residents represent only 12% of the population. The award translates to approximately $177 per rural resident, positioning Virginia in the middle tier nationally for per capita funding and far below the $464 per capita flowing to neighboring Vermont or the $180 per capita reaching West Virginia’s larger rural population.\nThe central tension shaping Virginia’s rural health transformation is geographic and economic inequality. Northern Virginia, anchored by the Washington metropolitan area, generates substantial state revenue and healthcare infrastructure. Southwest Virginia’s Appalachian counties, where coal industry decline has driven population loss and persistent poverty, share a state government but little else. Four Virginia counties bordering Kentucky and Tennessee are classified as economically distressed by the Appalachian Regional Commission, with poverty rates, unemployment, and health outcomes that rank among the nation’s worst.\nVirginia expanded Medicaid in 2018, providing coverage to approximately 1.9 million residents. That expansion stabilized rural hospitals operating on negative margins and enabled investments in behavioral health and chronic disease management. Now the One Big Beautiful Bill Act threatens to reverse those gains. The Department of Medical Assistance Services projects $26 billion in hospital funding losses over the next 14 years. Six rural hospitals are already classified as at risk of closure, and more than one-third of Virginia’s 28 rural hospitals reported negative operating margins in 2022.\nVirginia’s RHTP strategy, branded VA Rural Vitality, pursues four integrated initiatives: technology modernization, workforce development, telehealth and mobile services expansion, and chronic disease prevention. The approach reflects extensive stakeholder engagement across 12 listening sessions and input from over 200 organizations. Whether $189.5 million annually can meaningfully address disparities across six distinct rural regions remains the essential question.\nRural Health Landscape Geographic Context\nVirginia spans 42,775 square miles from the Chesapeake Bay to the Cumberland Gap. The state’s 133 counties and independent cities divide into dramatically different health environments. The Secretary of Health and Human Resources defines 57% of Virginia’s counties as rural under federal classifications, though these areas contain only 12.4% of the population. Six distinct rural regions present varying challenges:\nRegion Character Primary Challenges Southwest Appalachian coalfield counties Persistent poverty, economic distress, behavioral health crisis Roanoke/Alleghany Transition zone, manufacturing decline Aging population, hospital consolidation Southside Tobacco country, agricultural Economic decline, provider shortages, maternal health gaps Northern Piedmont Exurban growth pressure Changing demographics, service fragmentation Shenandoah Valley Agricultural, tourism Aging infrastructure, recruitment challenges Eastern Shore/Northern Neck Isolated coastal communities Geographic barriers, limited hospital access The four distressed Appalachian counties of Buchanan, Dickenson, Lee, and Wise represent Virginia’s most severe health crisis. All rank near the bottom statewide for health outcomes, with elevated rates of asthma, COPD, emphysema, and black lung disease from decades of coal mining. Lee County lost its only hospital in 2013, leaving residents without local emergency care for eight years until Ballad Health reopened Lee County Community Hospital in 2021.\nHealthcare Infrastructure\nVirginia maintains a relatively robust rural healthcare infrastructure, though facility distribution creates access disparities.\nFacility Type Count Notes Rural Hospitals 28 CMS definition; includes CAHs and short-term facilities Critical Access Hospitals 8 VDH designation; cost-based Medicare reimbursement Rural Emergency Hospitals 0 No conversions to date Rural Health Clinics 87 State locations outside urban areas FQHCs (Rural Locations) 106 Sites serving rural populations Short-Term/PPS Hospitals (Rural) 27 General acute care facilities The eight Critical Access Hospitals anchor Virginia’s smallest rural communities. The Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association reported that rural hospitals handled nearly 410,000 emergency department visits, approximately 48,000 inpatient admissions, and directly employed more than 8,000 people in their communities in 2021.\nHowever, financial stress pervades the sector. More than one-third of Virginia’s rural hospitals reported negative operating margins in 2022, a problem predating the COVID-19 pandemic. The University of North Carolina’s Sheps Center identifies six Virginia hospitals as at immediate risk of closure: facilities in Franklin, Emporia, South Hill, Tazewell, Kilmarnock, and Lee County.\nWorkforce Shortages\nVirginia’s healthcare workforce crisis manifests across multiple dimensions. A RAND Corporation study found that 102 of 133 Virginia counties are federally designated primary care Health Professional Shortage Areas, affecting 29% of the state’s population. Similar patterns appear in mental health: 93 counties are mental health HPSAs, affecting approximately 32% of Virginians.\nShortage Category Affected Counties Population Impact Primary Care HPSAs 102 of 133 29% of residents Mental Health HPSAs 93 of 133 32% of residents Dental Care HPSAs 98 designations Widespread shortage A Virginia Commonwealth University study found that 44% of the state’s neighborhoods lack adequate access to primary care services, affecting nearly 3.8 million residents. Rural communities bear the greatest burden: the study confirmed that workforce shortages concentrate in rural areas, particularly Southwest Virginia, where 90% of counties have been designated as mental health professional shortage areas.\nMaternal health access presents particular concern. 63% of Virginia counties lack an OB-GYN, and 22% of rural residents travel more than 40 minutes to reach a labor and delivery unit. Twenty of Virginia’s 29 rural hospitals do not offer maternity, labor and delivery, or postpartum care, forcing expectant mothers in large portions of the state to travel significant distances for prenatal visits and delivery.\nHealth Outcomes\nVirginia’s rural health outcomes reveal persistent disparities despite Medicaid expansion.\nIndicator Rural Virginia Comparison Chronic Disease Prevalence Above national averages Diabetes, obesity, hypertension Substance Use Disorder 17% of rural adults 9% of youth ages 12-17 Maternal Vulnerability Index Southwest: 46.1 State average: 36.0 Avoidable Hospitalizations 17.6 per 1,000 rural residents 12.2 per 1,000 non-rural Behavioral Health Access Limited Mental health professional shortage statewide Southwest Virginia’s health indicators are particularly stark. Counties in the Lenowisco, Cumberland Plateau, and Mount Rogers health districts report some of the highest mortality rates in the state and, in some cases, the nation. The region’s Health Blueprint identifies high rates of smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity as root causes of elevated mortality.\nThe opioid crisis continues to devastate rural communities. Governor Youngkin’s administration reports a 59% reduction in fentanyl deaths and 49% reduction in maternal deaths since taking office, but substance use disorder still affects 17% of rural adults and 9% of rural youth.\nRHTP Award and Context Award Details\nMetric Value FY2026 Allocation $189,544,888 Five-Year Projection ~$947 million Amount Requested ~$1 billion Award vs. Request 95% (first year) Per Rural Resident ~$177 National Award Ranking Bottom third by absolute amount Per Capita Ranking Mid-tier Virginia received approximately $89.5 million in workload funding beyond the $100 million baseline that all states share equally. The competitive component reflects scoring across rurality metrics, state policy factors, and application quality. Virginia’s relatively small rural population (12.4% of residents) and status as a Medicaid expansion state limited certain scoring advantages available to states like Mississippi or West Virginia.\nComparative Context\nVirginia’s award must be understood against its neighboring states:\nState FY2026 Award Rural Population Per Capita Virginia $189.5M 1.07M $177 West Virginia $199M 990K $201 North Carolina $213M 2.2M $97 Tennessee $207M 2.0M $104 Maryland $168M 416K $404 West Virginia’s announcement explicitly noted its award exceeds Virginia’s despite a smaller population, highlighting the per capita advantage that smaller, more rural states receive under the RHTP formula. Governor Morrisey called West Virginia’s award the “highest per capita award of any state that West Virginia touches.”\nMedicaid Expansion Context\nVirginia expanded Medicaid in 2018 following years of political debate. Approximately 1.9 million adults and children now receive coverage through Virginia Medicaid (including CHIP via FAMIS). Expansion allowed adults under 65 earning less than 138% of the Federal Poverty Level (approximately $21,600 annually) to qualify for coverage.\nRural hospitals have benefited substantially from expansion. Sovah Health, operating hospitals in Danville and Martinsville serving approximately 160,000 residents across Pittsylvania, Henry, and Patrick counties, reports that expansion enabled physician recruitment, emergency department upgrades, and new technology for robotic surgery programs.\nHowever, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act threatens to reverse these gains:\n$26 billion in projected hospital funding losses over 14 years (per DMAS) New community engagement requirements for Medicaid beneficiaries Enhanced eligibility verification procedures beginning 2027 Potential coverage loss for an estimated 350,000 or more Virginians The Georgetown University Center for Children and Families analysis of Census data confirms that residents in Southwest and Southside Virginia have the largest reliance on Medicaid, meaning these already-struggling regions face disproportionate exposure to federal cuts.\nState Approach Governance and Lead Agency\nThe Department of Medical Assistance Services (DMAS) serves as Virginia’s lead agency for RHTP implementation, partnering with the Virginia Department of Health (VDH) and the Office of the Secretary of Health and Human Resources. This structure leverages DMAS’s experience administering Medicaid managed care and VDH’s network of local health districts.\nGovernor Youngkin’s Executive Directive Twelve launched Virginia’s rural health transformation effort in August 2025, directing Secretary of Health and Human Resources Janet V. Kelly to develop the RHTP application through extensive stakeholder engagement.\nStakeholder Engagement\nVirginia’s application emerged from:\n12 listening sessions across the state Input from more than 200 organizations Public comment via dedicated email and web portal Regional proposals addressing location-specific needs The engagement process surfaced ideas ranging from outfitting EMS trucks in Southwest Virginia with satellite broadband to establishing mobile maternal health clinics for high-risk pregnancies.\nProgram and Funding Distribution\nVirginia’s VA Rural Vitality plan proposes four integrated initiatives with a fifth administrative component:\nInitiative Proposed Investment Focus Areas CareIQ $282 million EHR modernization, remote care expansion, health tech startup support Homegrown Health Heroes $132 million Rural hospital residencies, healthcare apprenticeships, community college programs Connected Care, Closer to Home $412 million Telehealth services, mobile health clinics, EMS enhancement Live Well, Together $124 million Wearables for chronic disease, food-as-medicine, children’s physical activity Program Management Office $49 million Grant administration, data tracking, progress evaluation Five-Year Total ~$1 billion Note: Allocations reflect five-year proposed budgets from Virginia’s RHTP application. Actual spending will scale to award levels.\nCareIQ represents Virginia’s technology modernization strategy. The initiative will help rural providers upgrade electronic health records, expand remote care options for patients, and support early-stage health technology companies developing solutions for rural healthcare delivery. Funding distribution will flow through a partnership between DMAS and the Virginia Health Care Foundation (VHCF), which maintains strong relationships across Virginia’s rural primary care and behavioral health provider networks.\nHomegrown Health Heroes addresses workforce pipeline by funding medical residencies at rural hospitals, expanding healthcare apprenticeship programs, and investing in community college pathways to healthcare careers. The initiative builds on existing state investments in health professions education and responds to stakeholder feedback identifying workforce as the most critical barrier to rural health access.\nConnected Care, Closer to Home pursues telehealth and mobile service expansion. The initiative reflects stakeholder priorities and CMS’s highlighting of Virginia’s maternal care and telehealth proposals. Mobile health units will bring services to underserved communities, and telehealth infrastructure will expand options for patients who cannot travel to facilities.\nLive Well, Together emphasizes prevention and chronic disease management through technology and community-based programs. Food-as-medicine programs, including the Southwest Virginia Produce Prescription Program supported by Carilion Clinic, enable physicians to prescribe fresh produce for patients with chronic conditions. The initiative also includes wearable technology for chronic disease monitoring and children’s physical activity programs.\nSocial Care Integration Virginia’s RHTP application incorporates social care elements primarily through the Live Well, Together initiative, though explicit SDOH/HRSN infrastructure receives limited dedicated funding.\nComponent Included in Plan Proposed Funding Operator/Vendor Likely Funded? SDOH/HRSN Screening Implicit Not specified Provider-level At Risk Food-as-Medicine Yes Portion of $124M Carilion Clinic, Feeding Southwest Virginia, Virginia Fresh Match Yes CHW Programs Limited mention Not specified TBD At Risk CIE Platform Not explicit Not specified TBD Unclear Food-as-Medicine represents Virginia’s most concrete social care investment. CMS specifically highlighted Virginia’s produce prescription programs in the national award announcement. The Southwest Virginia Produce Prescription Program, a regional initiative leveraging partnerships with community-based organizations and food retailers, connects patients to nutritious foods through prescriptions redeemable at Feeding Southwest Virginia locations and Virginia Fresh Match sites.\nThe application mentions technology-driven tools for chronic disease management but does not specify community information exchange platforms or comprehensive SDOH navigation infrastructure. Social care integration appears secondary to workforce and telehealth priorities.\nKey Subawardees Virginia’s RHTP implementation will involve multiple partner organizations:\nState Associations and Foundations\nVirginia Health Care Foundation (VHCF): Public-private organization distributing CareIQ funding to primary care and behavioral health providers Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association (VHHA): Hospital system coordination and advocacy Virginia Community Healthcare Association (VCHA): FQHC network representing 31 organizations with 200+ locations Health Systems\nBallad Health: Regional system serving Southwest Virginia and Northeast Tennessee, including reopened Lee County Community Hospital Sovah Health: Danville and Martinsville hospitals serving Southside population Carilion Clinic: Southwest Virginia, supporting Produce Prescription Program Valley Health: Northwestern Virginia and West Virginia border region Augusta Health: Shenandoah Valley (recently closed three rural clinics citing OBBBA impacts) Academic Partners\nUniversity of Virginia Health System: UVA Center for Telehealth, Healthy Appalachia Institute partnership Virginia Commonwealth University: Workforce research, primary care studies Virginia Tech Carilion: Medical education, Southwest Virginia focus Community Organizations\nFeeding Southwest Virginia: Food-as-medicine program partner Virginia Fresh Match: Produce prescription redemption network Health Wagon: Mobile healthcare for Southwest Virginia coalfield communities Assessment Strengths\nVirginia’s RHTP approach offers several advantages:\nMedicaid expansion foundation provides the coverage base that enables access improvements to translate into service utilization. Unlike non-expansion states where coverage gaps limit transformation potential, Virginia can focus RHTP resources on infrastructure and workforce rather than basic coverage.\nTelehealth infrastructure builds on UVA Health’s established Center for Telehealth and growing broadband investment across rural areas. Virginia’s approach to licensure compacts and telehealth regulation positions the state to deploy remote care services efficiently.\nFood-as-medicine programs demonstrate existing capacity for social care integration, with the Southwest Virginia Produce Prescription Program providing a replicable model for other regions.\nStakeholder engagement depth through 12 listening sessions and 200+ organizational inputs grounds the application in community-identified needs rather than top-down priorities.\nVulnerabilities\nSignificant challenges threaten successful implementation:\nInsufficient scale for the crisis magnitude. At $189.5 million annually serving 1.07 million rural residents across six distinct regions, Virginia’s award provides approximately $177 per person per year. This funding level cannot meaningfully address the workforce shortages, hospital financial distress, and infrastructure gaps documented across the state.\nMedicaid cut exposure creates a contradictory dynamic. The same legislation that created RHTP also threatens to remove $26 billion from Virginia hospitals over 14 years. RHTP’s five-year, roughly $950 million investment cannot offset that erosion. Rural hospitals already operating at negative margins will face intensifying pressure regardless of transformation funding.\nGeographic dispersion of resources across six rural regions with distinct needs may dilute impact. Southwest Virginia’s Appalachian crisis, Southside’s agricultural decline, and the Eastern Shore’s isolation require different interventions. A one-size-fits-all approach risks underserving the most distressed areas.\nAnnual reassessment uncertainty adds implementation risk. CMS will evaluate Virginia’s progress annually and may adjust future awards based on performance metrics. Cardinal News reported that experts worry the short timeline makes demonstrating meaningful impact difficult, with early evaluations likely focusing on process measures rather than health outcomes.\nSustainability Prospects\nVirginia’s RHTP investments face uncertain sustainability beyond 2030:\nTechnology modernization (CareIQ) may prove most durable if infrastructure investments reduce ongoing operational costs and vendors become self-sustaining.\nWorkforce development (Homegrown Health Heroes) creates pipeline capacity that persists beyond RHTP funding, though training programs require ongoing investment.\nMobile health services (Connected Care) require continued operational funding that RHTP cannot guarantee. Mobile units and telehealth infrastructure have ongoing costs beyond initial capital investment.\nPrevention programs (Live Well, Together) depend on sustained funding for food-as-medicine, wearables, and community programs. These initiatives often lose funding when grants expire.\nCritical Success Factors\nVirginia’s RHTP success depends on:\nRapid deployment of funds before annual reassessment creates uncertainty Regional prioritization that directs resources to Southwest and Southside where need is greatest Workforce pipeline acceleration to address immediate provider shortages Integration with existing programs including the Virginia Rural Health Plan and ongoing behavioral health initiatives Protection of rural hospitals from OBBBA-driven closures that would eliminate the infrastructure RHTP seeks to strengthen Conclusion Virginia’s VA Rural Vitality plan represents a reasonable approach constrained by inadequate resources. The $189.5 million annual award cannot address disparities across a state where Northern Virginia prosperity masks Appalachian poverty, where more than one-third of rural hospitals operate in the red, and where 102 of 133 counties lack adequate primary care providers.\nThe approach itself is sound: technology modernization, workforce development, telehealth expansion, and food-as-medicine all address documented needs. Implementation through DMAS and VDH leverages existing capacity. Stakeholder engagement grounded the application in community priorities.\nBut Virginia faces the same structural contradiction confronting every RHTP recipient: federal transformation funding arrives alongside federal Medicaid cuts that threaten to eliminate the gains transformation might achieve. The $26 billion in projected hospital funding losses over 14 years dwarfs the roughly $950 million in RHTP investment. Augusta Health’s closure of three rural clinics in September 2025, explicitly citing the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, previews what may come.\nWhat to watch: Southwest Virginia’s distressed counties offer the clearest test of RHTP’s potential. If Ballad Health’s recently reopened Lee County hospital survives, if produce prescription programs expand, and if workforce pipelines deliver providers to coalfield communities, Virginia’s approach will have demonstrated value despite its constraints. If rural hospitals continue closing and provider shortages persist, the experiment will have confirmed what critics argued from the start: $50 billion in transformation funding cannot offset $911 billion in Medicaid cuts.\nFor the 1.07 million Virginians living in rural areas, the question is not whether VA Rural Vitality has good ideas but whether good ideas with inadequate funding can outrun bad policy with far larger impacts.\nCross-References Related Series 2 Articles\nRHTP 2A: RHTP Structure and Rules (statutory framework) RHTP 2B: Medicaid Architecture and the 911B Question (expansion state context) RHTP 2H: The 2030 Cliff (sustainability constraints) Regional Comparison States\nRHTP 3.WV: West Virginia (neighboring Appalachian state, higher per capita funding) RHTP 3.NC: North Carolina (comparable rural population, recent expansion) RHTP 3.TN: Tennessee (neighboring non-expansion state) RHTP 3.MD: Maryland (neighboring state, smaller rural population, higher per capita funding) RHTP 3.KY: Kentucky (Appalachian region priority state) Related Series 4 Topics\n4B: Workforce Development 4C: Telehealth Expansion 4H: Social Needs Integration Sources Appalachian Regional Commission. “County Economic Status in Appalachia, FY 2024.” ARC, 2024, www.arc.gov/county-economic-status-in-appalachia.\nCardinal News. “Virginia Set to Receive $189.5 Million from Federal Rural Health Transformation Fund.” Cardinal News, 31 Dec. 2025, cardinalnews.org/2025/12/31/virginia-set-to-receive-189-5-million-from-federal-rural-health-transformation-fund.\nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services. “CMS Announces $50 Billion in Awards to Strengthen Rural Health in All 50 States.” CMS Newsroom, 29 Dec. 2025, www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-announces-50-billion-awards-strengthen-rural-health-all-50-states.\nGovernor of Virginia. “Governor Glenn Youngkin Submits Virginia’s Application for $1 Billion in Federal Funding to Transform Rural Health Care.” Office of the Governor, 7 Nov. 2025, www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2025/november/name-1070971-en.html.\nRural Health Information Hub. “Rural Health for Virginia Overview.” RHIhub, Sept. 2025, www.ruralhealthinfo.org/states/virginia.\nShadowen, Hannah, et al. “Primary Care Shortage Affects 44% of Virginia’s Neighborhoods.” Annals of Family Medicine, 2025, via Virginia Commonwealth University News, news.vcu.edu/article/2025/07/primary-care-shortage-affects-44-of-virginias-neighbhorhoods-new-vcu-study-finds.\nUniversity of Virginia Health. “New Health Blueprint Maps Healthier Future for Southwest Virginia.” UVA Health Newsroom, 16 May 2024, newsroom.uvahealth.com/2024/05/16/new-health-blueprint-maps-healthier-future-for-southwest-virginia.\nVirginia Department of Health. “Critical Access Hospitals.” VDH Health Equity, 2025, www.vdh.virginia.gov/health-equity/critical-access-hospitals-cah.\nVirginia Department of Medical Assistance Services. “VA Rural Vitality: Rural Health Transformation Program Application.” CMS-RHT-26-001, Nov. 2025, www.hhr.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/secretary-of-health-and-human-resources/pdf/RHC-Transformation-Project-Narrative.pdf.\nVirginia Hospital and Healthcare Association. “2023 Virginia Rural Hospital Report.” VHHA, Sept. 2023, www.vhha.com/pressroom/2023-virginia-rural-hospital-report.\nVirginia Mercury. “Virginia Awarded $189 Million Rural Health Grant.” Virginia Mercury, 29 Dec. 2025, virginiamercury.com/2025/12/29/virginia-awaits-decision-on-1-billion-rural-health-grant.\nVPM News. “Southwest, Southside Virginians Could Bear the Brunt of Medicaid Cuts.” VPM, 8 May 2025, www.vpm.org/news/2025-05-08/trump-medicaid-cuts-southwest-southside-virginia-sovah-martina-tatum.\nRHTP 3.VA: Virginia / Series 3: State Implementation / Rural Health Transformation Project / Version 3: January 2026\n",

<p><em>A Medicaid expansion state where prosperous Northern Virginia and struggling Appalachian coalfield counties share borders but not health outcomes, Virginia&rsquo;s VA Rural Vitality plan pursues telehealth expansion and workforce development as Southwest and Southside providers brace for federal cuts that threaten institutions only recently stabilized.</em></p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#introduction">#</a></h2>
<p>Virginia&rsquo;s <strong>$189.5 million FY2026 RHTP award</strong> reflects modest competitive scoring for a state whose 1.07 million rural residents represent only 12% of the population. The award translates to approximately <strong>$177 per rural resident</strong>, positioning Virginia in the middle tier nationally for per capita funding and far below the $464 per capita flowing to neighboring Vermont or the $180 per capita reaching West Virginia&rsquo;s larger rural population.</p>
<p>The central tension shaping Virginia&rsquo;s rural health transformation is <strong>geographic and economic inequality</strong>. Northern Virginia, anchored by the Washington metropolitan area, generates substantial state revenue and healthcare infrastructure. Southwest Virginia&rsquo;s Appalachian counties, where coal industry decline has driven population loss and persistent poverty, share a state government but little else. Four Virginia counties bordering Kentucky and Tennessee are classified as <strong>economically distressed</strong> by the Appalachian Regional Commission, with poverty rates, unemployment, and health outcomes that rank among the nation&rsquo;s worst.</p>
<p>Virginia expanded Medicaid in 2018, providing coverage to approximately 1.9 million residents. That expansion stabilized rural hospitals operating on negative margins and enabled investments in behavioral health and chronic disease management. Now the <strong>One Big Beautiful Bill Act</strong> threatens to reverse those gains. The Department of Medical Assistance Services projects <strong>$26 billion in hospital funding losses</strong> over the next 14 years. Six rural hospitals are already classified as at risk of closure, and more than one-third of Virginia&rsquo;s 28 rural hospitals reported negative operating margins in 2022.</p>
<p>Virginia&rsquo;s RHTP strategy, branded <strong>VA Rural Vitality</strong>, pursues four integrated initiatives: technology modernization, workforce development, telehealth and mobile services expansion, and chronic disease prevention. The approach reflects extensive stakeholder engagement across 12 listening sessions and input from over 200 organizations. Whether $189.5 million annually can meaningfully address disparities across six distinct rural regions remains the essential question.</p>

<p><strong>Geographic Context</strong></p>
<p>Virginia spans <strong>42,775 square miles</strong> from the Chesapeake Bay to the Cumberland Gap. The state&rsquo;s <strong>133 counties and independent cities</strong> divide into dramatically different health environments. The Secretary of Health and Human Resources defines <strong>57% of Virginia&rsquo;s counties as rural</strong> under federal classifications, though these areas contain only 12.4% of the population. Six distinct rural regions present varying challenges:</p>

<p>The <strong>four distressed Appalachian counties</strong> of Buchanan, Dickenson, Lee, and Wise represent Virginia&rsquo;s most severe health crisis. All rank near the bottom statewide for health outcomes, with elevated rates of asthma, COPD, emphysema, and black lung disease from decades of coal mining. Lee County lost its only hospital in 2013, leaving residents without local emergency care for eight years until Ballad Health reopened Lee County Community Hospital in 2021.</p>
<p><strong>Healthcare Infrastructure</strong></p>
<p>Virginia maintains a relatively robust rural healthcare infrastructure, though facility distribution creates access disparities.</p>

<p>The <strong>eight Critical Access Hospitals</strong> anchor Virginia&rsquo;s smallest rural communities. The Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association reported that rural hospitals handled nearly <strong>410,000 emergency department visits</strong>, approximately <strong>48,000 inpatient admissions</strong>, and directly employed more than <strong>8,000 people</strong> in their communities in 2021.</p>
<p>However, financial stress pervades the sector. More than <strong>one-third of Virginia&rsquo;s rural hospitals</strong> reported negative operating margins in 2022, a problem predating the COVID-19 pandemic. The University of North Carolina&rsquo;s Sheps Center identifies six Virginia hospitals as at immediate risk of closure: facilities in Franklin, Emporia, South Hill, Tazewell, Kilmarnock, and Lee County.</p>
<p><strong>Workforce Shortages</strong></p>
<p>Virginia&rsquo;s healthcare workforce crisis manifests across multiple dimensions. A RAND Corporation study found that <strong>102 of 133 Virginia counties</strong> are federally designated <strong>primary care Health Professional Shortage Areas</strong>, affecting 29% of the state&rsquo;s population. Similar patterns appear in mental health: <strong>93 counties are mental health HPSAs</strong>, affecting approximately 32% of Virginians.</p>

<p>A Virginia Commonwealth University study found that <strong>44% of the state&rsquo;s neighborhoods</strong> lack adequate access to primary care services, affecting nearly 3.8 million residents. Rural communities bear the greatest burden: the study confirmed that workforce shortages concentrate in rural areas, particularly Southwest Virginia, where <strong>90% of counties</strong> have been designated as mental health professional shortage areas.</p>
<p><strong>Maternal health access</strong> presents particular concern. <strong>63% of Virginia counties lack an OB-GYN</strong>, and <strong>22% of rural residents travel more than 40 minutes</strong> to reach a labor and delivery unit. Twenty of Virginia&rsquo;s 29 rural hospitals do not offer maternity, labor and delivery, or postpartum care, forcing expectant mothers in large portions of the state to travel significant distances for prenatal visits and delivery.</p>
<p><strong>Health Outcomes</strong></p>
<p>Virginia&rsquo;s rural health outcomes reveal persistent disparities despite Medicaid expansion.</p>

<p>Southwest Virginia&rsquo;s health indicators are particularly stark. Counties in the <strong>Lenowisco, Cumberland Plateau, and Mount Rogers health districts</strong> report some of the highest mortality rates in the state and, in some cases, the nation. The region&rsquo;s Health Blueprint identifies high rates of smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity as root causes of elevated mortality.</p>
<p>The <strong>opioid crisis</strong> continues to devastate rural communities. Governor Youngkin&rsquo;s administration reports a 59% reduction in fentanyl deaths and 49% reduction in maternal deaths since taking office, but substance use disorder still affects 17% of rural adults and 9% of rural youth.</p>

<p>Virginia received approximately <strong>$89.5 million in workload funding</strong> beyond the $100 million baseline that all states share equally. The competitive component reflects scoring across rurality metrics, state policy factors, and application quality. Virginia&rsquo;s relatively small rural population (12.4% of residents) and status as a Medicaid expansion state limited certain scoring advantages available to states like Mississippi or West Virginia.</p>

<p>West Virginia&rsquo;s announcement explicitly noted its award exceeds Virginia&rsquo;s despite a smaller population, highlighting the <strong>per capita advantage</strong> that smaller, more rural states receive under the RHTP formula. Governor Morrisey called West Virginia&rsquo;s award the &ldquo;highest per capita award of any state that West Virginia touches.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Medicaid Expansion Context</strong></p>
<p>Virginia expanded Medicaid in 2018 following years of political debate. Approximately <strong>1.9 million adults and children</strong> now receive coverage through Virginia Medicaid (including CHIP via FAMIS). Expansion allowed adults under 65 earning less than 138% of the Federal Poverty Level (approximately $21,600 annually) to qualify for coverage.</p>
<p>Rural hospitals have benefited substantially from expansion. Sovah Health, operating hospitals in Danville and Martinsville serving approximately 160,000 residents across Pittsylvania, Henry, and Patrick counties, reports that expansion enabled physician recruitment, emergency department upgrades, and new technology for robotic surgery programs.</p>
<p>However, the <strong>One Big Beautiful Bill Act</strong> threatens to reverse these gains:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>$26 billion in projected hospital funding losses</strong> over 14 years (per DMAS)</li>
<li><strong>New community engagement requirements</strong> for Medicaid beneficiaries</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced eligibility verification procedures</strong> beginning 2027</li>
<li><strong>Potential coverage loss</strong> for an estimated 350,000 or more Virginians</li>
</ul>
<p>The Georgetown University Center for Children and Families analysis of Census data confirms that residents in <strong>Southwest and Southside Virginia</strong> have the largest reliance on Medicaid, meaning these already-struggling regions face disproportionate exposure to federal cuts.</p>
<h2 id="state-approach">State Approach<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#state-approach">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Governance and Lead Agency</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>Department of Medical Assistance Services (DMAS)</strong> serves as Virginia&rsquo;s lead agency for RHTP implementation, partnering with the <strong>Virginia Department of Health (VDH)</strong> and the <strong>Office of the Secretary of Health and Human Resources</strong>. This structure leverages DMAS&rsquo;s experience administering Medicaid managed care and VDH&rsquo;s network of local health districts.</p>
<p>Governor Youngkin&rsquo;s <strong>Executive Directive Twelve</strong> launched Virginia&rsquo;s rural health transformation effort in August 2025, directing Secretary of Health and Human Resources Janet V. Kelly to develop the RHTP application through extensive stakeholder engagement.</p>
<p><strong>Stakeholder Engagement</strong></p>
<p>Virginia&rsquo;s application emerged from:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>12 listening sessions</strong> across the state</li>
<li>Input from <strong>more than 200 organizations</strong></li>
<li>Public comment via dedicated email and web portal</li>
<li>Regional proposals addressing location-specific needs</li>
</ul>
<p>The engagement process surfaced ideas ranging from outfitting EMS trucks in Southwest Virginia with satellite broadband to establishing mobile maternal health clinics for high-risk pregnancies.</p>

The initiative will help rural providers upgrade electronic health records, expand remote care options for patients, and support early-stage health technology companies developing solutions for rural healthcare delivery. Funding distribution will flow through a partnership between DMAS and the <strong>Virginia Health Care Foundation (VHCF)</strong>, which maintains strong relationships across Virginia&rsquo;s rural primary care and behavioral health provider networks.</p>
<p><strong>Homegrown Health Heroes</strong> addresses workforce pipeline by funding medical residencies at rural hospitals, expanding healthcare apprenticeship programs, and investing in community college pathways to healthcare careers. The initiative builds on existing state investments in health professions education and responds to stakeholder feedback identifying workforce as the most critical barrier to rural health access.</p>
<p><strong>Connected Care, Closer to Home</strong> pursues telehealth and mobile service expansion. The initiative reflects stakeholder priorities and CMS&rsquo;s highlighting of Virginia&rsquo;s maternal care and telehealth proposals. Mobile health units will bring services to underserved communities, and telehealth infrastructure will expand options for patients who cannot travel to facilities.</p>
<p><strong>Live Well, Together</strong> emphasizes prevention and chronic disease management through technology and community-based programs. <strong>Food-as-medicine programs</strong>, including the Southwest Virginia Produce Prescription Program supported by Carilion Clinic, enable physicians to prescribe fresh produce for patients with chronic conditions. The initiative also includes wearable technology for chronic disease monitoring and children&rsquo;s physical activity programs.</p>

<p><strong>Food-as-Medicine</strong> represents Virginia&rsquo;s most concrete social care investment. CMS specifically highlighted Virginia&rsquo;s produce prescription programs in the national award announcement. The Southwest Virginia Produce Prescription Program, a regional initiative leveraging partnerships with community-based organizations and food retailers, connects patients to nutritious foods through prescriptions redeemable at Feeding Southwest Virginia locations and Virginia Fresh Match sites.</p>
<p>The application mentions <strong>technology-driven tools</strong> for chronic disease management but does not specify community information exchange platforms or comprehensive SDOH navigation infrastructure. Social care integration appears secondary to workforce and telehealth priorities.</p>

<h2 id="assessment">Assessment<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#assessment">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
<p>Virginia&rsquo;s RHTP approach offers several advantages:</p>
<p><strong>Medicaid expansion foundation</strong> provides the coverage base that enables access improvements to translate into service utilization. Unlike non-expansion states where coverage gaps limit transformation potential, Virginia can focus RHTP resources on infrastructure and workforce rather than basic coverage.</p>
<p><strong>Telehealth infrastructure</strong> builds on UVA Health&rsquo;s established Center for Telehealth and growing broadband investment across rural areas. Virginia&rsquo;s approach to licensure compacts and telehealth regulation positions the state to deploy remote care services efficiently.</p>
<p><strong>Food-as-medicine programs</strong> demonstrate existing capacity for social care integration, with the Southwest Virginia Produce Prescription Program providing a replicable model for other regions.</p>
<p><strong>Stakeholder engagement depth</strong> through 12 listening sessions and 200+ organizational inputs grounds the application in community-identified needs rather than top-down priorities.</p>
<p><strong>Vulnerabilities</strong></p>
<p>Significant challenges threaten successful implementation:</p>
<p><strong>Insufficient scale</strong> for the crisis magnitude. At $189.5 million annually serving 1.07 million rural residents across six distinct regions, Virginia&rsquo;s award provides approximately <strong>$177 per person per year</strong>. This funding level cannot meaningfully address the workforce shortages, hospital financial distress, and infrastructure gaps documented across the state.</p>
<p><strong>Medicaid cut exposure</strong> creates a contradictory dynamic. The same legislation that created RHTP also threatens to remove $26 billion from Virginia hospitals over 14 years. RHTP&rsquo;s five-year, roughly $950 million investment cannot offset that erosion. Rural hospitals already operating at negative margins will face intensifying pressure regardless of transformation funding.</p>
<p><strong>Geographic dispersion</strong> of resources across six rural regions with distinct needs may dilute impact. Southwest Virginia&rsquo;s Appalachian crisis, Southside&rsquo;s agricultural decline, and the Eastern Shore&rsquo;s isolation require different interventions. A one-size-fits-all approach risks underserving the most distressed areas.</p>
<p><strong>Annual reassessment uncertainty</strong> adds implementation risk. CMS will evaluate Virginia&rsquo;s progress annually and may adjust future awards based on performance metrics. Cardinal News reported that experts worry the short timeline makes demonstrating meaningful impact difficult, with early evaluations likely focusing on process measures rather than health outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Sustainability Prospects</strong></p>
<p>Virginia&rsquo;s RHTP investments face uncertain sustainability beyond 2030:</p>
<p><strong>Technology modernization</strong> (CareIQ) may prove most durable if infrastructure investments reduce ongoing operational costs and vendors become self-sustaining.</p>
<p><strong>Workforce development</strong> (Homegrown Health Heroes) creates pipeline capacity that persists beyond RHTP funding, though training programs require ongoing investment.</p>
<p><strong>Mobile health services</strong> (Connected Care) require continued operational funding that RHTP cannot guarantee. Mobile units and telehealth infrastructure have ongoing costs beyond initial capital investment.</p>
<p><strong>Prevention programs</strong> (Live Well, Together) depend on sustained funding for food-as-medicine, wearables, and community programs. These initiatives often lose funding when grants expire.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Success Factors</strong></p>
<p>Virginia&rsquo;s RHTP success depends on:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Rapid deployment</strong> of funds before annual reassessment creates uncertainty</li>
<li><strong>Regional prioritization</strong> that directs resources to Southwest and Southside where need is greatest</li>
<li><strong>Workforce pipeline acceleration</strong> to address immediate provider shortages</li>
<li><strong>Integration with existing programs</strong> including the Virginia Rural Health Plan and ongoing behavioral health initiatives</li>
<li><strong>Protection of rural hospitals</strong> from OBBBA-driven closures that would eliminate the infrastructure RHTP seeks to strengthen</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>Virginia&rsquo;s VA Rural Vitality plan represents a <strong>reasonable approach constrained by inadequate resources</strong>. The $189.5 million annual award cannot address disparities across a state where Northern Virginia prosperity masks Appalachian poverty, where more than one-third of rural hospitals operate in the red, and where 102 of 133 counties lack adequate primary care providers.</p>
<p>The approach itself is sound: technology modernization, workforce development, telehealth expansion, and food-as-medicine all address documented needs. Implementation through DMAS and VDH leverages existing capacity. Stakeholder engagement grounded the application in community priorities.</p>
<p>But Virginia faces the same <strong>structural contradiction</strong> confronting every RHTP recipient: federal transformation funding arrives alongside federal Medicaid cuts that threaten to eliminate the gains transformation might achieve. The $26 billion in projected hospital funding losses over 14 years dwarfs the roughly $950 million in RHTP investment. Augusta Health&rsquo;s closure of three rural clinics in September 2025, explicitly citing the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, previews what may come.</p>
<p><strong>What to watch</strong>: Southwest Virginia&rsquo;s distressed counties offer the clearest test of RHTP&rsquo;s potential. If Ballad Health&rsquo;s recently reopened Lee County hospital survives, if produce prescription programs expand, and if workforce pipelines deliver providers to coalfield communities, Virginia&rsquo;s approach will have demonstrated value despite its constraints. If rural hospitals continue closing and provider shortages persist, the experiment will have confirmed what critics argued from the start: $50 billion in transformation funding cannot offset $911 billion in Medicaid cuts.</p>
<p>For the 1.07 million Virginians living in rural areas, the question is not whether VA Rural Vitality has good ideas but whether good ideas with inadequate funding can outrun bad policy with far larger impacts.</p>
