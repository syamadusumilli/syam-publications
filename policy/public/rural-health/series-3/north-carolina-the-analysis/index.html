  "articleBody": "Part 2 documented what North Carolina proposes: six regional hubs coordinating transformation activities, $213 million annually distributed through NC ROOTS infrastructure designed to force integration across clinical, behavioral, workforce, and social care initiatives. The plan bets that coordination generates efficiency that isolated providers cannot achieve, leveraging existing state infrastructure including NCCARE360, the NC AHEC network, and Medicaid managed care regional alignment.\nThis analysis evaluates what actually works, what struggles against implementation headwinds, and what gets cut when plans meet reality. North Carolina enters RHTP implementation with genuine advantages: the nation’s most advanced Medicaid social care pilot (now discontinued), statewide community information exchange deployment, established CHW certification infrastructure, and recent Medicaid expansion generating coverage momentum.\nCentral question: Can North Carolina’s coordination infrastructure produce sustainable transformation, or does the simultaneous erosion of the Medicaid foundation undermine hub-based investment regardless of implementation quality?\nThe evidence suggests certain initiatives will succeed because they build on genuine state capacity. Others will struggle because coordination takes time RHTP timelines may not allow. Social care integration survives as infrastructure while service delivery collapses alongside the Healthy Opportunities Pilots that demonstrated its value. And the Medicaid math remains unforgiving: RHTP replaces approximately 27% of projected rural hospital losses under H.R. 1. Coordination cannot manufacture resources that do not exist.\nWhat Works Existing Technology Infrastructure Requiring Extension Rather Than Construction North Carolina’s most significant advantage is not having to build what other states must create from scratch. Two technology platforms already operate statewide, requiring RHTP investment for expansion rather than procurement.\nNCCARE360 deployed across all 100 counties before RHTP existed. The Unite Us partnership provides closed-loop referral capacity, resource directory maintenance, and outcome tracking that other states struggle to achieve. RHTP investment connects remaining rural providers to existing infrastructure rather than funding competitive platform selection, vendor negotiation, and deployment timelines that consume eighteen to thirty-six months elsewhere.\nNC HealthConnex operates as the state Health Information Exchange with established connectivity to health systems, hospitals, and many provider practices. Clinical data flows through existing pipes. RHTP investment expands rural provider connectivity to an operational platform rather than building HIE architecture that other states list as aspirational.\nWhy this matters for implementation:\nTechnology procurement represents the single greatest cause of delayed RHTP implementation across states. Vendor selection, contracting, implementation, and training consume two to three years. North Carolina skips this entirely for social care referral infrastructure and clinical data exchange.\nTimeline advantage: While other states issue RFPs in 2026, evaluate proposals in 2027, and begin deployment in 2028, North Carolina connects rural providers to operational platforms immediately. Year 1 produces connected providers rather than procurement documents.\nLimitation: Platform existence does not equal universal adoption. Small rural practices, independent physicians, and community-based organizations face connectivity costs and workflow changes regardless of platform maturity. The infrastructure exists; adoption requires ongoing investment.\nNC AHEC Network Providing Implementation Backbone The Area Health Education Centers program provides North Carolina with distributed workforce development capacity that other states must build or contract externally. Nine regional AHECs cover all NC ROOTS hub regions with existing relationships, training infrastructure, and community connections.\nImplementation advantage:\nGraduate medical education expansion through AHEC produces faster results than academic medical center partnerships requiring new affiliation agreements. AHEC already operates rural residency programs, continuing education, and practice support coaching. RHTP funding expands existing programs rather than launching new initiatives requiring organizational development.\nCHW training pipeline operates through AHEC in coordination with the Community College System. The nine-competency curriculum exists. Training sites exist. Certification pathways exist. RHTP investment increases throughput rather than building training infrastructure.\nEvidence supporting effectiveness:\nNC AHEC’s COVID-era Community Health Worker Initiative deployed 400+ CHWs across the state. The infrastructure supporting that deployment remains operational. Lessons from rapid scaling inform RHTP workforce strategy.\nSustainability pathway: AHEC operates on diversified funding including state appropriations, federal grants, and health system partnerships. RHTP becomes one funding stream among several rather than sole support for workforce programming. Post-2030 continuation through existing AHEC funding mechanisms is plausible, though scale may contract.\nMedicaid Managed Care Regional Alignment The decision to align NC ROOTS hubs with Medicaid Standard Plan regions creates coordination efficiency other states cannot replicate. Four statewide managed care organizations and the regional Tailored Plans already operate through regional structures. Hub boundaries match existing administrative geography.\nWhy alignment works:\nManaged care organizations have incentives to engage with hub activities. Care coordination improvements reduce costs. Quality measure performance affects contracts. Population health investment aligns MCO financial interests with transformation goals.\nTailored Plan integration matters particularly for behavioral health. The four LME-MCOs managing complex behavioral health populations already operate regional structures. Hub-based behavioral health integration connects to existing managed care infrastructure rather than creating parallel systems.\nContract leverage: NCDHHS can incorporate hub participation expectations into managed care contracts. Quality improvement investment counts toward MCO requirements. The state possesses regulatory authority to encourage participation that purely voluntary models lack.\nLimitation: Managed care alignment assumes coverage stability. If H.R. 1 implementation reduces enrollment, MCOs have fewer members through whom to achieve quality improvements. Contract leverage diminishes alongside enrollment.\nRecent Expansion Momentum Creating Measurement Opportunity North Carolina expanded Medicaid on December 1, 2023, with enrollment exceeding 650,000 within twelve months. RHTP implementation coincides with measurable expansion impact. The state can demonstrate before-and-after outcomes that non-expansion states cannot.\nThe measurement advantage:\nExpansion established baseline data for newly covered populations. Rural enrollment exceeded 233,000 people. RHTP initiatives addressing these populations can demonstrate outcomes against pre-expansion comparison periods.\nHospital stabilization evidence: Rural hospitals gained revenue from expansion coverage. RHTP can document whether transformation investments compound expansion benefits or whether Medicaid cuts erode the foundation beneath both.\nThe political reality: North Carolina provides the most direct test of whether RHTP plus expansion produces different outcomes than RHTP in non-expansion states. Success validates the expansion model. Failure, whether from implementation shortcomings or Medicaid erosion, provides cautionary evidence.\nWhat Struggles Hub Establishment Timelines Under Optimistic Assumptions NC ROOTS requires six Hub Lead organizations to coordinate regional transformation activities. Hub Leads must be identified, contracted, staffed, and operational before significant subaward activity occurs. The timeline assumes rapid progress that hub-based governance rarely achieves.\nThe proposed timeline:\nQ1 2026: CMS cooperative agreement finalized, planning begins Q2-Q3 2026: Hub Lead competitive selection process Q4 2026: Hub Lead contracts executed 2027: Hub network development, provider recruitment, operational launch 2028-2030: Full hub operations, initiative implementation Why this struggles:\nHub Lead identification requires organizations capable of managing regional coordination, subaward distribution, performance oversight, and stakeholder engagement. Qualified organizations must exist, be willing to assume coordination responsibility, and have capacity beyond current operations.\nCompetitive selection takes time. RFP development, proposal evaluation, contract negotiation, and governance establishment consume twelve to eighteen months under favorable conditions. The Q3-Q4 2026 Hub Lead selection timeline assumes processes that typically require longer.\nEastern North Carolina faces the most significant Hub Lead identification challenge. The region has the highest need, fewest resources, and least organizational capacity. ECU Health may be the only entity capable of Hub Lead responsibilities, creating de facto appointment rather than competitive selection.\nWhat happens if timelines slip:\nYear 1 RHTP activities proceed through existing state infrastructure while hub establishment continues. This is manageable. But if Hub Lead contracts do not execute until mid-2027, the program loses eighteen months of coordinated implementation. Hub-dependent initiatives cannot launch until hubs exist.\nVoluntary Provider Participation in Coordination Networks NC ROOTS assumes rural providers voluntarily participate in hub networks. The plan lacks mandatory participation requirements. Coordination benefits assume broad engagement that voluntary structures may not achieve.\nThe participation challenge:\nRural providers face immediate operational pressures: staffing shortages, financial strain, administrative burden. Hub participation adds coordination meetings, reporting requirements, and workflow changes. Providers already overwhelmed may decline participation regardless of potential long-term benefits.\nFinancial incentives are unclear. Hub participation does not automatically generate revenue. Value-based payment models may eventually reward coordination, but transition takes years. Providers need near-term financial relief, not future payment model promises.\nThe competitive dynamic: Providers in the same hub region compete for patients. Coordination asks competitors to share information, align services, and coordinate care. Some providers will resist transparency with regional competitors.\nWhat limited participation means:\nHubs with 40-50% provider participation cannot achieve regional coordination. Incomplete networks create gaps in care transitions, referral management, and population health. The coordination premise fails if providers do not coordinate.\nPotential mitigations:\nNCDHHS can tie RHTP subcontracting eligibility to hub participation. Providers wanting technology grants, workforce support, or other RHTP benefits must join hub networks. This converts voluntary participation into participation required for RHTP access. The state’s January 2026 communications have not clarified whether this approach will be implemented.\nHealthy Opportunities Pilots Discontinuation North Carolina’s signature social care innovation stopped accepting new services on July 1, 2025 after the General Assembly declined to appropriate continuation funding. The nation’s most advanced Medicaid SDOH program entered indefinite pause precisely as RHTP social care integration planning accelerated.\nWhat was lost:\nOver 30,000 Medicaid members enrolled across 33 counties $107 million delivered to community organizations Three Network Lead organizations coordinating human service delivery Closed-loop referral infrastructure connecting healthcare to social services Evidence generating $85 monthly savings per participant The contradiction:\nRHTP explicitly proposes to build on HOP model elements through hub-based social care programming. But the model itself lost funding. The infrastructure, Network Leads, and CBO relationships developed through HOP face dissolution while RHTP plans reference their expansion.\nRep. Donny Lambeth’s explanation: The budget was “too tight” for $175 million over two years, and lawmakers had not seen “valid justification” showing benefits outweigh costs. This from the same General Assembly that received RHTP funds predicated partly on North Carolina’s SDOH leadership.\nWhat remains:\nNCCARE360 platform continues operating. Resource directories remain. Technology infrastructure persists. But service delivery funding disappeared. Screening infrastructure without service delivery captures data without resolving needs.\nThe HOP loss cascades:\nNetwork Leads that connected healthcare to CBOs lose contracts CBOs that built capacity for HOP service delivery lose revenue Care managers trained in HOP referral workflows lose the program they learned Members who received housing, food, and transportation support lose services Evidence base demonstrating cost savings loses ongoing data RHTP cannot restore HOP. The funding gap exists in state appropriations, not federal RHTP allowable uses. NC ROOTS can implement screening and referral coordination, but service delivery depends on resources RHTP does not provide and the state declined to fund.\nThe Medicaid Budget Standoff North Carolina entered RHTP implementation amid an unresolved state Medicaid budget crisis. Governor Stein initiated Medicaid reimbursement rate cuts in late 2025 to manage budget shortfalls, then reversed the cuts under provider pressure. The underlying budget gap remains.\nThe numbers:\nNCDHHS warned the General Assembly in May 2025 that Medicaid funding was insufficient. Neither House nor Senate budgets provided adequate appropriations. Rate cuts of 3% to 10% across provider categories were scheduled to take effect.\nProvider response:\nThe NC Healthcare Association warned that cuts would be “incredibly significant” for 130+ hospitals and health systems. Many providers, particularly rural facilities, indicated they might stop accepting Medicaid patients. Rural hospitals operating on thin margins faced existential threats from state-level cuts before federal cuts under H.R. 1 even begin.\nThe reversal and its limits:\nGovernor Stein cancelled the rate cuts in January 2026, restoring provider reimbursements. But the budget shortfall that prompted cuts remains unresolved. State Medicaid costs continue growing while appropriations lag. The rate cut threat may return.\nImplementation implications:\nProviders asked to invest in transformation activities face uncertainty about reimbursement levels. Hub participation requires organizational stability that Medicaid budget volatility undermines. The state cannot promise consistent payment levels while asking for transformation investment.\nWhat Gets Cut When Federal Success Criteria Shape State Priorities North Carolina’s RHTP implementation must satisfy CMS annual re-scoring requirements. Initiatives that produce demonstrable metrics within annual cycles receive sustained funding. Initiatives requiring multi-year development before showing results face pressure.\nInitiatives Preserved (measurable annual outcomes):\nTechnology connectivity expansion (providers connected, platforms utilized) Workforce training completions (certificates issued, programs launched) Telehealth utilization (visits completed, access points established) MAHA-aligned wellness activity (participation counts, engagement metrics) Initiatives Reduced (longer development timelines):\nValue-based payment model pilots (require years to demonstrate savings) Hub governance development (coordination infrastructure, not services) Practice transformation support (behavior change slower than technology adoption) Initiatives Effectively Eliminated (dependent on discontinued HOP):\nMedicaid-funded social care service delivery CBO capacity building for SDOH intervention delivery Closed-loop service resolution beyond referral coordination The Social Care Triage North Carolina’s RHTP preserves social care infrastructure while losing social care service delivery. The distinction matters enormously for rural residents.\nWhat survives:\nComponent Status Explanation SDOH screening Funded Embedded in hub operations, technology tools Referral platform Funded NCCARE360 connectivity expansion Resource directories Funded Platform maintenance, CBO registration Data capture Funded Federal reporting requirements Navigation coordination Funded Hub-based coordinators, estimated ~$8M What does not survive:\nComponent Status Explanation Housing support services Not funded HOP discontinued, RHTP cannot replace Food delivery/nutrition services Partially funded Some hub-based programming, not HOP scale Transportation services Not funded HOP discontinued Utility assistance Not funded HOP discontinued Violence intervention services Not funded HOP discontinued The screen-without-resolution problem:\nHub-based screening identifies that a patient faces housing instability, food insecurity, or transportation barriers. NCCARE360 enables referral to community resources. But if those resources lack capacity to serve additional people, screening identifies problems without solving them.\nHOP Network Leads (Access East, Community Care of the Lower Cape Fear, Impact Health) built CBO capacity in pilot regions. That capacity development paused. CBOs that expanded to meet HOP demand may contract as HOP funding disappears. Referrals to CBOs with reduced capacity produce waitlists rather than services.\nSocial Care Survival Assessment The Partial Funding Reality North Carolina received its FY2026 allocation without dramatic reduction from application requests. The state applied for $213 million annually and received $213 million. This is not a partial funding story at the federal level.\nBut state-level funding discontinuation of HOP creates a partial funding reality for social care that federal RHTP approval cannot address. North Carolina’s SDOH advantage derived from the combination of:\nFederal Medicaid waiver authority (CMS approval for HOP) State appropriations for HOP implementation (~$175M biennially) RHTP funding for coordination infrastructure H.R. 1 maintained federal RHTP funding. CMS extended the 1115 waiver allowing HOP. But the state legislature discontinued HOP appropriations. Two of three funding streams continue; the one paying for actual services stopped.\nSDOH/HRSN Component Survival Component Pre-RHTP Status RHTP Investment Post-RHTP Projection Screening HOP + clinical integration Embedded in hubs Survives Referral platform NCCARE360 statewide ~$4M connectivity Survives Navigation HOP care managers ~$8M hub coordinators Partially survives Service delivery (housing) HOP funded Not funded Does not survive Service delivery (food) HOP funded Partial hub nutrition Reduced Service delivery (transport) HOP funded Not funded Does not survive Closed-loop tracking NCCARE360 Platform funded Survives (for referrals that connect) Assessment: North Carolina implements comprehensive screening and referral coordination without comprehensive service delivery. The infrastructure captures needs, documents referrals, and tracks which referrals connect to resources. It cannot ensure those resources have capacity to serve.\nCHW Program Survival Element RHTP Funding Survival Assessment Training pipeline ~$6M via AHEC/community colleges High: Infrastructure exists, expansion feasible Certification system Existing (NCCHWA) High: State infrastructure, RHTP-independent Employment support Hub-embedded Moderate: Depends on hub employer capacity Supervision infrastructure Partial Moderate: AHEC coaching, hub integration Deployment scale (200/year) Targeted Moderate-High: 150-200 achievable The employment question:\nNorth Carolina CHW certification exists. Training capacity exists. The question is who employs CHWs after training.\nMedicaid managed care represents the primary sustainability mechanism. NC Medicaid permits MCOs to count CHW services within Advanced Medical Homes and care management programs. If MCOs integrate CHWs into care models, employment continues post-RHTP through Medicaid payment.\nHOP Network Leads employed CHWs for SDOH intervention delivery. That employment pathway closed with HOP discontinuation. CHWs trained for HOP-style social care integration need alternative employers.\nHub-based employment may provide transition pathway. If Hub Leads employ CHWs for hub network coordination, RHTP funding supports CHW employment directly. But Hub Lead employment depends on sustained RHTP funding through 2030.\nCIE Platform Survival Status: Already exists. RHTP extends connectivity. High survival probability.\nNorth Carolina does not face CIE platform procurement risk because NCCARE360 already operates statewide. Unite Us technology partnership provides platform capability. RHTP investment connects rural providers to existing infrastructure.\nPost-2030 survival: NCCARE360 operates through the Foundation for Health Leadership and Innovation with diversified funding. Platform continuation does not depend on RHTP alone. Rural provider connectivity achieved through RHTP persists unless providers actively disconnect.\nLimitation: Platform survival does not equal utilization survival. If hub coordination structures dissolve post-2030, provider engagement with referral workflows may decline. The technology persists; the organizational commitment to use it may not.\nSustainability Beyond 2030 Component Post-2030 Funding Mechanism Survival Probability NCCARE360 platform Foundation funding, state support High NC HealthConnex State appropriations, provider fees High CHW workforce Medicaid MCO employment Moderate Hub coordination No identified mechanism Low AHEC workforce programs Diversified funding Moderate-High Social care service delivery HOP restoration uncertain Low The sustainability hierarchy:\nTechnology infrastructure built before RHTP continues through established funding. Technology infrastructure expanded through RHTP likely continues because it integrates into existing systems.\nWorkforce investments produce trained professionals who persist regardless of funding source. CHWs certified remain certified. Providers completing training remain trained.\nCoordination infrastructure depends on ongoing funding. Hub Lead organizations, coordination staffing, and regional governance require continuous investment. No post-2030 funding mechanism exists for hub maintenance.\nService delivery requires continuous operational funding. RHTP cannot fund ongoing social care services. HOP discontinuation demonstrates state unwillingness to sustain social care service delivery investment. Post-2030 service delivery survival probability approaches zero absent policy reversal.\nThe Medicaid Math North Carolina’s Specific Calculation Metric Value RHTP annual investment $213 million RHTP per rural resident ~$97 Projected H.R. 1 Medicaid cuts (NC, 10-year) $49.9 billion Projected annual Medicaid cuts (average) $4.99 billion Projected rural hospital losses (10-year) ~$3.7 billion RHTP five-year total ~$1.065 billion RHTP as percentage of rural hospital losses ~27% RHTP as percentage of total NC Medicaid cuts ~2.1% North Carolina’s own press release acknowledges the mathematics: RHTP “will need to overcome significant funding losses” from H.R. 1. The state entered RHTP implementation with public recognition that transformation funds do not offset erosion.\nWhat Medicaid Cuts Mean for North Carolina Rural Healthcare Coverage losses under work requirements:\nH.R. 1 imposes work requirements for “able-bodied” Medicaid beneficiaries effective January 1, 2027. North Carolina’s expansion population of 650,000+ includes substantial numbers who may fail verification requirements not because they lack work but because documentation processes fail.\nThe documentation burden: Agricultural workers, seasonal employees, gig economy participants, and self-employed individuals often lack employer-verified work documentation. Administrative disenrollment from paperwork failures, not actual work status, historically drives coverage losses in work requirement programs.\nRural populations face disproportionate impact. Rural employment patterns include more agricultural work, more self-employment, and more seasonal variation. Work requirements designed around traditional employer relationships disadvantage rural workforce patterns.\nHospital revenue implications:\nTen North Carolina hospitals face closure risk according to Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform analysis. Six face immediate risk within two to three years. These facilities operate on margins that cannot absorb revenue reductions from Medicaid cuts, coverage losses, or work requirement disenrollment.\nThe cascade North Carolina experienced before:\nMartin General Hospital closed in August 2023 after mounting losses reached $30 million. The closure left Martin County without emergency care. The community attempts to reopen as a Rural Emergency Hospital, potentially the first such conversion from complete closure. H.R. 1 creates conditions that could produce additional Martin General closures across the state.\nThe Expansion Paradox Intensified North Carolina expanded Medicaid in December 2023, providing coverage to 650,000+ residents including over 233,000 from rural communities. The expansion stabilized rural hospital finances after decades of erosion.\nNow H.R. 1 threatens to unwind expansion gains through work requirements, eligibility verification burdens, and FMAP reductions. North Carolina’s recent expansion enrollees face the highest disenrollment risk because their coverage is newest and their administrative engagement patterns are least established.\nThe timeline collision:\nDecember 2023: Expansion launches July 2025: Work requirements take effect 2026-2030: RHTP implementation 2027 onward: Work requirement enforcement, eligibility reverification 2030: RHTP ends, Medicaid cuts reach maximum impact North Carolina attempts transformation during the precise window when the coverage foundation beneath transformation erodes. Hub-based coordination assumes covered populations. Work requirements reduce covered populations. The coordination infrastructure serves shrinking populations.\nStated Priorities Versus Actual Priorities What the Application Emphasizes North Carolina’s RHTP application presents regional hub coordination as the transformative innovation. NC ROOTS appears throughout as the mechanism forcing integration across initiatives. Social care integration receives prominent treatment, referencing HOP success and NCCARE360 deployment.\nThe application rhetoric suggests:\nCoordination generates efficiency exceeding isolated investment Existing social care infrastructure provides implementation advantage Hub-based governance ensures community voice in regional priorities Value-based payment transition creates sustainability What Funding Allocations Reveal Initiative Allocation Priority Signal NC ROOTS Hubs ~$45M (21%) Infrastructure, not services Technology ~$40M (19%) Demonstrable connectivity metrics Primary care/prevention ~$35M (16%) Clinical over social Workforce ~$32M (15%) Training pipeline Behavioral health ~$30M (14%) Integration priority Value-based payment ~$20M (9%) Delayed transformation Technology receives nearly equivalent investment to hub establishment. The state prioritizes infrastructure deployment producing measurable outcomes over coordination mechanisms requiring years to demonstrate value.\nSocial care integration appears throughout initiative descriptions but receives no dedicated funding stream. SDOH screening embeds in hub operations. Navigation coordinates through hub staff. Service delivery depends on resources outside RHTP scope.\nThe Real Theory of Change North Carolina’s actual theory of change differs from stated theory:\nStated theory: Regional coordination transforms rural healthcare delivery by forcing integration, building community voice into governance, and creating sustainable systems through value-based payment transition.\nRevealed theory: Technology connectivity and workforce training produce demonstrable outcomes satisfying federal scoring requirements. Hub coordination provides administrative framework for deploying federal funds. Social care data capture meets federal SDOH documentation requirements. Service delivery remains someone else’s problem.\nThe gap between rhetoric and resources reflects practical constraints, not cynical deception. North Carolina genuinely wishes to integrate social care. The state simply cannot fund social care service delivery at HOP scale through RHTP, and the General Assembly refused to fund HOP continuation. Stated priorities encounter resource reality.\nSocial Care Rhetoric Versus Funded Reality Application language: “Build on NC Healthy Opportunities Pilots and leverage state’s national leadership in Medicaid SDOH integration”\nFunded reality: HOP discontinued July 2025. RHTP funds referral infrastructure. Service delivery unfunded.\nApplication language: “NCCARE360 provides statewide platform for closed-loop referral coordination”\nFunded reality: True. Platform funded. What happens after referral depends on CBO capacity that HOP discontinuation reduced.\nApplication language: “Hub-based navigation coordinators connect clinical referrals to community resources”\nFunded reality: Navigation staff funded. Community resources may lack capacity to serve additional referrals.\nThe rhetoric accurately describes infrastructure. It elides the service delivery gap that infrastructure cannot bridge.\nLessons for Other States What North Carolina’s Approach Teaches Build on existing infrastructure rather than creating new: North Carolina’s technology advantage derives from platforms deployed before RHTP. States starting CIE platform procurement in 2026 lose two to three years. Build what you need before needing it.\nRegional alignment with existing administrative structures works: Aligning hubs with Medicaid managed care regions creates coordination rather than conflict. States creating hub boundaries that contradict existing geographic arrangements generate confusion.\nWorkforce infrastructure requires ongoing institutional commitment: NC AHEC operated for decades before RHTP. The training capacity exists because the state invested in it long-term. States creating workforce pipelines solely through RHTP face sustainability challenges.\nState budget politics can undermine federal investment: North Carolina has the most advanced Medicaid SDOH program in the nation. The General Assembly discontinued it. Federal RHTP funding cannot overcome state unwillingness to sustain complementary investment.\nTransferable Elements Statewide CIE platform deployment before RHTP creates implementation advantage. Other states can accelerate platform adoption now rather than waiting for RHTP timelines.\nManaged care contract integration provides participation incentive beyond voluntary goodwill. States with Medicaid managed care can incorporate hub expectations into MCO contracts.\nDiversified workforce institution partnerships create sustainability pathways. Community colleges, AHEC programs, and academic medical centers with multiple funding streams sustain programs when RHTP ends.\nContext-Specific Elements Recent Medicaid expansion provides measurement opportunity other states lack. Non-expansion states cannot demonstrate before-and-after outcomes.\nExisting CHW certification infrastructure reduces training development time. States without established certification must build credentialing systems.\nHealthy Opportunities Pilots experience generated lessons and relationships even though funding discontinued. States without prior SDOH pilot experience lack institutional learning.\nWhat to Avoid Assuming coordination alone generates efficiency: Hub administration costs money. Coordination meetings take time. Whether coordination benefits exceed coordination costs depends on implementation details that optimistic projections assume.\nPromising social care integration without service delivery funding: North Carolina’s application references HOP while HOP funding faces discontinuation. Overpromising social care when service delivery funding does not exist creates expectations RHTP cannot meet.\nVoluntary participation assumptions: Providers facing existential financial pressure may not volunteer for additional coordination requirements. States relying on voluntary engagement may achieve less participation than plans assume.\nConclusion North Carolina enters RHTP implementation with genuine advantages and genuine constraints. The advantages are real: statewide technology platforms, established workforce infrastructure, Medicaid managed care alignment, recent expansion momentum, and institutional experience with SDOH integration. Few states possess comparable starting position.\nThe constraints are equally real. Healthy Opportunities Pilots discontinuation removes the service delivery complement to screening infrastructure. State Medicaid budget volatility creates provider uncertainty. Hub establishment timelines assume rapid progress that coordination governance rarely achieves. And the Medicaid math remains unforgiving: RHTP replaces 27% of projected rural hospital losses while the other 73% erodes the foundation beneath transformation.\nWhat survives: Technology infrastructure integrated into ongoing operations. Trained workforce professionals who practice regardless of funding source. CIE platform capacity maintained through established organizations. Behavioral health integration built into Medicaid managed care.\nWhat struggles: Hub governance requiring organizational development time RHTP timelines may not allow. Value-based payment transitions requiring market conditions that Medicaid cuts undermine. Coordination benefits dependent on voluntary participation that competing priorities may prevent.\nWhat does not survive: Social care service delivery at anything approaching HOP scale. CBO capacity building for intervention delivery. Closed-loop resolution beyond referral documentation. The promise that screening translates to services.\nThe honest assessment: North Carolina will implement RHTP components successfully. Technology connectivity will expand. Workforce training will occur. Hubs will eventually establish. The state’s existing infrastructure provides implementation advantages that produce visible progress.\nBut progress is not transformation. Hub-based coordination cannot overcome the simultaneous erosion of Medicaid coverage that provides the financial foundation for rural healthcare. North Carolina invests $213 million annually in transformation while losing access to $4.99 billion annually in Medicaid support. The hubs coordinate activity within a shrinking resource environment.\nThe coordination bet has merit. Regional integration does generate efficiencies. Local governance does improve decision-making. Existing infrastructure does enable faster implementation.\nWhether efficiency gains from coordination exceed efficiency losses from Medicaid erosion determines whether North Carolina’s rural residents emerge from RHTP better or worse off than they entered. The mathematics favor erosion. Implementation excellence may narrow but cannot close the gap.\nNorth Carolina provides the test case for whether model state infrastructure can produce different outcomes than structural constraints predict. The answer matters for every state attempting transformation against the same headwinds.\nCross-References Series 1: Rural America\n1.A: Geography and Definition (North Carolina regional context) 1.C: Education and Literacy (workforce pipeline requirements) 1.D: Economics and Employment (rural economic foundations) 1.E: Healthcare Access (infrastructure baseline) 1.G: Social Fabric and Isolation (community capacity) Series 2: Federal Policy Architecture\n2.A: RHTP Structure and Rules (statutory constraints) 2.B: Medicaid Architecture (expansion state dynamics) 2.C: Medicare Rural Provisions (CAH context) 2.H: The 2030 Cliff (sustainability analysis) Series 3: State Implementation\n3.NC.1: North Carolina, The Problem (baseline crisis) 3.NC.2: North Carolina, The Plan (proposed response) 3.TX: Texas (scale penalty comparison) 3.MS: Mississippi (non-expansion contrast) Series 4: Transformation Approaches\n4.D: Community Health Workers (CHW deployment models) 4.H: Social Needs Integration (SDOH/HRSN frameworks) Sources Becker’s Hospital Review. “756 Hospitals at Risk of Closure, State by State.” Becker’s Hospital Review, 20 Dec. 2025, www.beckershospitalreview.com/finance/756-hospitals-at-risk-of-closure-state-by-state/.\nCenter for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform. “Rural Hospitals at Risk of Closure.” CHQPR, Dec. 2025, www.ruralhospitals.chqpr.org/Downloads/Rural_Hospitals_at_Risk_of_Closing.pdf.\nDuke-Margolis Institute for Health Policy. “North Carolina’s Healthy Opportunities Pilots: Impacts and Budgetary Considerations.” Duke University, Jan. 2026, healthpolicy.duke.edu/publications/north-carolinas-healthy-opportunities-pilots-impacts-and-budgetary-considerations.\nHealthcare Finance News. “Additional 55 Rural Hospitals at Risk of Closure Should Medicaid Cuts Pass.” Healthcare Finance News, 14 Jan. 2026, www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/additional-55-rural-hospitals-risk-closure-should-medicaid-cuts-pass.\nNorth Carolina Department of Health and Human Services. “Healthy Opportunities Pilots Update.” NC Medicaid, 2 June 2025, medicaid.ncdhhs.gov/blog/2025/06/02/healthy-opportunities-pilots-update.\nNorth Carolina Department of Health and Human Services. “North Carolina Awarded $213 Million for Rural Health Transformation Program.” NCDHHS Press Release, 29 Dec. 2025, www.ncdhhs.gov/news/press-releases/2025/12/29/north-carolina-awarded-213-million-rural-health-transformation-program-strategic-roadmap-and-federal.\nNorth Carolina Department of Health and Human Services. “Understanding the Impact of Cuts to the NC Medicaid Budget.” NC Medicaid, 2025, medicaid.ncdhhs.gov/about-nc-medicaid/understanding-impact-cuts-nc-medicaid-budget.\nNorth Carolina Health News. “Healthy Opportunities Pilot Told to Prepare for Program to Shutter.” North Carolina Health News, 3 June 2025, www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/2025/06/03/funding-cut-for-healthy-opportunities/.\nNorth Carolina Health News. “Medicaid Standoff Could Put Health Care for Many North Carolinians at Risk.” North Carolina Health News, 29 Sept. 2025, www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/2025/09/29/medicaid-rate-standoff/.\nPew Charitable Trusts. “New Federal Medicaid Policies Compound State Budget Pressures.” Pew Charitable Trusts, 13 Jan. 2026, www.pew.org/en/research-and-analysis/articles/2026/01/13/new-federal-medicaid-policies-compound-state-budget-pressures.\nUniversity of North Carolina Cecil G.

<p>Part 2 documented what North Carolina proposes: six regional hubs coordinating transformation activities, $213 million annually distributed through <strong>NC ROOTS</strong> infrastructure designed to force integration across clinical, behavioral, workforce, and social care initiatives. The plan bets that <strong>coordination generates efficiency</strong> that isolated providers cannot achieve, leveraging existing state infrastructure including NCCARE360, the NC AHEC network, and Medicaid managed care regional alignment.</p>
<p>This analysis evaluates what actually works, what struggles against implementation headwinds, and what gets cut when plans meet reality. North Carolina enters RHTP implementation with genuine advantages: the nation&rsquo;s most advanced Medicaid social care pilot (now discontinued), statewide community information exchange deployment, established CHW certification infrastructure, and recent Medicaid expansion generating coverage momentum.</p>
<p><strong>Central question</strong>: Can North Carolina&rsquo;s coordination infrastructure produce sustainable transformation, or does the simultaneous erosion of the Medicaid foundation undermine hub-based investment regardless of implementation quality?</p>
<p>The evidence suggests certain initiatives will succeed because they build on genuine state capacity. Others will struggle because coordination takes time RHTP timelines may not allow. Social care integration survives as infrastructure while service delivery collapses alongside the Healthy Opportunities Pilots that demonstrated its value. And the Medicaid math remains unforgiving: <strong>RHTP replaces approximately 27% of projected rural hospital losses</strong> under H.R. 1. Coordination cannot manufacture resources that do not exist.</p>

<p>North Carolina&rsquo;s most significant advantage is <strong>not having to build</strong> what other states must create from scratch. Two technology platforms already operate statewide, requiring RHTP investment for expansion rather than procurement.</p>
<p><strong>NCCARE360</strong> deployed across all 100 counties before RHTP existed. The Unite Us partnership provides closed-loop referral capacity, resource directory maintenance, and outcome tracking that other states struggle to achieve. RHTP investment connects remaining rural providers to existing infrastructure rather than funding competitive platform selection, vendor negotiation, and deployment timelines that consume eighteen to thirty-six months elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>NC HealthConnex</strong> operates as the state Health Information Exchange with established connectivity to health systems, hospitals, and many provider practices. Clinical data flows through existing pipes. RHTP investment expands rural provider connectivity to an operational platform rather than building HIE architecture that other states list as aspirational.</p>
<p><strong>Why this matters for implementation</strong>:</p>
<p>Technology procurement represents the single greatest cause of delayed RHTP implementation across states. Vendor selection, contracting, implementation, and training consume two to three years. North Carolina skips this entirely for social care referral infrastructure and clinical data exchange.</p>
<p><strong>Timeline advantage</strong>: While other states issue RFPs in 2026, evaluate proposals in 2027, and begin deployment in 2028, North Carolina connects rural providers to operational platforms immediately. Year 1 produces connected providers rather than procurement documents.</p>
<p><strong>Limitation</strong>: Platform existence does not equal universal adoption. Small rural practices, independent physicians, and community-based organizations face connectivity costs and workflow changes regardless of platform maturity. The infrastructure exists; adoption requires ongoing investment.</p>
<h3 id="nc-ahec-network-providing-implementation-backbone">NC AHEC Network Providing Implementation Backbone<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#nc-ahec-network-providing-implementation-backbone">#</a></h3>
<p>The <strong>Area Health Education Centers</strong> program provides North Carolina with distributed workforce development capacity that other states must build or contract externally. Nine regional AHECs cover all NC ROOTS hub regions with existing relationships, training infrastructure, and community connections.</p>
<p><strong>Implementation advantage</strong>:</p>
<p>Graduate medical education expansion through AHEC produces faster results than academic medical center partnerships requiring new affiliation agreements. AHEC already operates rural residency programs, continuing education, and practice support coaching. RHTP funding expands existing programs rather than launching new initiatives requiring organizational development.</p>
<p><strong>CHW training pipeline</strong> operates through AHEC in coordination with the Community College System. The nine-competency curriculum exists. Training sites exist. Certification pathways exist. RHTP investment increases throughput rather than building training infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>Evidence supporting effectiveness</strong>:</p>
<p>NC AHEC&rsquo;s COVID-era Community Health Worker Initiative deployed <strong>400+ CHWs</strong> across the state. The infrastructure supporting that deployment remains operational. Lessons from rapid scaling inform RHTP workforce strategy.</p>
<p><strong>Sustainability pathway</strong>: AHEC operates on diversified funding including state appropriations, federal grants, and health system partnerships. RHTP becomes one funding stream among several rather than sole support for workforce programming.

<p>The decision to align NC ROOTS hubs with <strong>Medicaid Standard Plan regions</strong> creates coordination efficiency other states cannot replicate. Four statewide managed care organizations and the regional Tailored Plans already operate through regional structures. Hub boundaries match existing administrative geography.</p>
<p><strong>Why alignment works</strong>:</p>
<p>Managed care organizations have incentives to engage with hub activities. Care coordination improvements reduce costs. Quality measure performance affects contracts. Population health investment aligns MCO financial interests with transformation goals.</p>
<p><strong>Tailored Plan integration</strong> matters particularly for behavioral health. The four LME-MCOs managing complex behavioral health populations already operate regional structures. Hub-based behavioral health integration connects to existing managed care infrastructure rather than creating parallel systems.</p>
<p><strong>Contract leverage</strong>: NCDHHS can incorporate hub participation expectations into managed care contracts. Quality improvement investment counts toward MCO requirements. The state possesses regulatory authority to encourage participation that purely voluntary models lack.</p>
<p><strong>Limitation</strong>: Managed care alignment assumes coverage stability. If H.R. 1 implementation reduces enrollment, MCOs have fewer members through whom to achieve quality improvements. Contract leverage diminishes alongside enrollment.</p>
<h3 id="recent-expansion-momentum-creating-measurement-opportunity">Recent Expansion Momentum Creating Measurement Opportunity<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#recent-expansion-momentum-creating-measurement-opportunity">#</a></h3>
<p>North Carolina expanded Medicaid on <strong>December 1, 2023</strong>, with enrollment exceeding 650,000 within twelve months. RHTP implementation coincides with measurable expansion impact. The state can demonstrate before-and-after outcomes that non-expansion states cannot.</p>
<p><strong>The measurement advantage</strong>:</p>
<p>Expansion established baseline data for newly covered populations. Rural enrollment exceeded 233,000 people. RHTP initiatives addressing these populations can demonstrate outcomes against pre-expansion comparison periods.</p>
<p><strong>Hospital stabilization evidence</strong>: Rural hospitals gained revenue from expansion coverage. RHTP can document whether transformation investments compound expansion benefits or whether Medicaid cuts erode the foundation beneath both.</p>
<p><strong>The political reality</strong>: North Carolina provides the most direct test of whether RHTP plus expansion produces different outcomes than RHTP in non-expansion states. Success validates the expansion model. Failure, whether from implementation shortcomings or Medicaid erosion, provides cautionary evidence.</p>

<p>NC ROOTS requires <strong>six Hub Lead organizations</strong> to coordinate regional transformation activities. Hub Leads must be identified, contracted, staffed, and operational before significant subaward activity occurs. The timeline assumes rapid progress that hub-based governance rarely achieves.</p>
<p><strong>The proposed timeline</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Q1 2026: CMS cooperative agreement finalized, planning begins</li>
<li>Q2-Q3 2026: Hub Lead competitive selection process</li>
<li>Q4 2026: Hub Lead contracts executed</li>
<li>2027: Hub network development, provider recruitment, operational launch</li>
<li>2028-2030: Full hub operations, initiative implementation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why this struggles</strong>:</p>
<p>Hub Lead identification requires organizations capable of managing regional coordination, subaward distribution, performance oversight, and stakeholder engagement. Qualified organizations must exist, be willing to assume coordination responsibility, and have capacity beyond current operations.</p>
<p><strong>Competitive selection takes time</strong>. RFP development, proposal evaluation, contract negotiation, and governance establishment consume twelve to eighteen months under favorable conditions. The Q3-Q4 2026 Hub Lead selection timeline assumes processes that typically require longer.</p>
<p><strong>Eastern North Carolina</strong> faces the most significant Hub Lead identification challenge. The region has the highest need, fewest resources, and least organizational capacity. ECU Health may be the only entity capable of Hub Lead responsibilities, creating de facto appointment rather than competitive selection.</p>
<p><strong>What happens if timelines slip</strong>:</p>
<p>Year 1 RHTP activities proceed through existing state infrastructure while hub establishment continues. This is manageable. But if Hub Lead contracts do not execute until mid-2027, the program loses eighteen months of coordinated implementation. Hub-dependent initiatives cannot launch until hubs exist.</p>
<h3 id="voluntary-provider-participation-in-coordination-networks">Voluntary Provider Participation in Coordination Networks<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#voluntary-provider-participation-in-coordination-networks">#</a></h3>
<p>NC ROOTS assumes rural providers <strong>voluntarily participate</strong> in hub networks. The plan lacks mandatory participation requirements. Coordination benefits assume broad engagement that voluntary structures may not achieve.</p>
<p><strong>The participation challenge</strong>:</p>
<p>Rural providers face immediate operational pressures: staffing shortages, financial strain, administrative burden. Hub participation adds coordination meetings, reporting requirements, and workflow changes. Providers already overwhelmed may decline participation regardless of potential long-term benefits.</p>
<p><strong>Financial incentives are unclear</strong>. Hub participation does not automatically generate revenue. Value-based payment models may eventually reward coordination, but transition takes years. Providers need near-term financial relief, not future payment model promises.</p>
<p><strong>The competitive dynamic</strong>: Providers in the same hub region compete for patients. Coordination asks competitors to share information, align services, and coordinate care. Some providers will resist transparency with regional competitors.</p>
<p><strong>What limited participation means</strong>:</p>
<p>Hubs with 40-50% provider participation cannot achieve regional coordination. Incomplete networks create gaps in care transitions, referral management, and population health. The coordination premise fails if providers do not coordinate.</p>
<p><strong>Potential mitigations</strong>:</p>
<p>NCDHHS can tie RHTP subcontracting eligibility to hub participation. Providers wanting technology grants, workforce support, or other RHTP benefits must join hub networks. This converts voluntary participation into participation required for RHTP access. The state&rsquo;s January 2026 communications have not clarified whether this approach will be implemented.</p>
<h3 id="healthy-opportunities-pilots-discontinuation">Healthy Opportunities Pilots Discontinuation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#healthy-opportunities-pilots-discontinuation">#</a></h3>
<p>North Carolina&rsquo;s signature social care innovation <strong>stopped accepting new services on July 1, 2025</strong> after the General Assembly declined to appropriate continuation funding. The nation&rsquo;s most advanced Medicaid SDOH program entered indefinite pause precisely as RHTP social care integration planning accelerated.</p>
<p><strong>What was lost</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Over 30,000 Medicaid members</strong> enrolled across 33 counties</li>
<li><strong>$107 million</strong> delivered to community organizations</li>
<li><strong>Three Network Lead organizations</strong> coordinating human service delivery</li>
<li><strong>Closed-loop referral infrastructure</strong> connecting healthcare to social services</li>
<li><strong>Evidence generating $85 monthly savings</strong> per participant</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The contradiction</strong>:</p>
<p>RHTP explicitly proposes to <strong>build on HOP model elements</strong> through hub-based social care programming. But the model itself lost funding. The infrastructure, Network Leads, and CBO relationships developed through HOP face dissolution while RHTP plans reference their expansion.</p>
<p><strong>Rep. Donny Lambeth&rsquo;s explanation</strong>: The budget was &ldquo;too tight&rdquo; for $175 million over two years, and lawmakers had not seen &ldquo;valid justification&rdquo; showing benefits outweigh costs. This from the same General Assembly that received RHTP funds predicated partly on North Carolina&rsquo;s SDOH leadership.</p>
<p><strong>What remains</strong>:</p>
<p>NCCARE360 platform continues operating. Resource directories remain. Technology infrastructure persists. But <strong>service delivery funding disappeared</strong>. Screening infrastructure without service delivery captures data without resolving needs.</p>
<p><strong>The HOP loss cascades</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Network Leads that connected healthcare to CBOs lose contracts</li>
<li>CBOs that built capacity for HOP service delivery lose revenue</li>
<li>Care managers trained in HOP referral workflows lose the program they learned</li>
<li>Members who received housing, food, and transportation support lose services</li>
<li>Evidence base demonstrating cost savings loses ongoing data</li>
</ul>
<p>RHTP cannot restore HOP. The funding gap exists in state appropriations, not federal RHTP allowable uses. NC ROOTS can implement screening and referral coordination, but service delivery depends on resources RHTP does not provide and the state declined to fund.</p>
<h3 id="the-medicaid-budget-standoff">The Medicaid Budget Standoff<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-medicaid-budget-standoff">#</a></h3>
<p>North Carolina entered RHTP implementation amid an unresolved <strong>state Medicaid budget crisis</strong>. Governor Stein initiated Medicaid reimbursement rate cuts in late 2025 to manage budget shortfalls, then reversed the cuts under provider pressure. The underlying budget gap remains.</p>
<p><strong>The numbers</strong>:</p>
<p>NCDHHS warned the General Assembly in May 2025 that Medicaid funding was insufficient. Neither House nor Senate budgets provided adequate appropriations. Rate cuts of <strong>3% to 10%</strong> across provider categories were scheduled to take effect.</p>
<p><strong>Provider response</strong>:</p>
<p>The NC Healthcare Association warned that cuts would be &ldquo;incredibly significant&rdquo; for 130+ hospitals and health systems. Many providers, particularly rural facilities, indicated they might stop accepting Medicaid patients. Rural hospitals operating on thin margins faced existential threats from state-level cuts before federal cuts under H.R. 1 even begin.</p>
<p><strong>The reversal and its limits</strong>:</p>
<p>Governor Stein cancelled the rate cuts in January 2026, restoring provider reimbursements. But the budget shortfall that prompted cuts remains unresolved. State Medicaid costs continue growing while appropriations lag. The rate cut threat may return.</p>
<p><strong>Implementation implications</strong>:</p>
<p>Providers asked to invest in transformation activities face uncertainty about reimbursement levels. Hub participation requires organizational stability that Medicaid budget volatility undermines. The state cannot promise consistent payment levels while asking for transformation investment.</p>

<p>North Carolina&rsquo;s RHTP implementation must satisfy CMS annual re-scoring requirements. Initiatives that produce demonstrable metrics within annual cycles receive sustained funding. Initiatives requiring multi-year development before showing results face pressure.</p>
<p><strong>Initiatives Preserved</strong> (measurable annual outcomes):</p>
<ul>
<li>Technology connectivity expansion (providers connected, platforms utilized)</li>
<li>Workforce training completions (certificates issued, programs launched)</li>
<li>Telehealth utilization (visits completed, access points established)</li>
<li>MAHA-aligned wellness activity (participation counts, engagement metrics)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Initiatives Reduced</strong> (longer development timelines):</p>
<ul>
<li>Value-based payment model pilots (require years to demonstrate savings)</li>
<li>Hub governance development (coordination infrastructure, not services)</li>
<li>Practice transformation support (behavior change slower than technology adoption)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Initiatives Effectively Eliminated</strong> (dependent on discontinued HOP):</p>
<ul>
<li>Medicaid-funded social care service delivery</li>
<li>CBO capacity building for SDOH intervention delivery</li>
<li>Closed-loop service resolution beyond referral coordination</li>

<p><strong>The screen-without-resolution problem</strong>:</p>
<p>Hub-based screening identifies that a patient faces housing instability, food insecurity, or transportation barriers. NCCARE360 enables referral to community resources. But if those resources lack capacity to serve additional people, screening identifies problems without solving them.</p>
<p><strong>HOP Network Leads</strong> (Access East, Community Care of the Lower Cape Fear, Impact Health) built CBO capacity in pilot regions. That capacity development paused. CBOs that expanded to meet HOP demand may contract as HOP funding disappears. Referrals to CBOs with reduced capacity produce waitlists rather than services.</p>

<p>North Carolina received its FY2026 allocation without dramatic reduction from application requests. The state applied for $213 million annually and received $213 million. This is not a partial funding story at the federal level.</p>
<p><strong>But state-level funding discontinuation of HOP creates a partial funding reality for social care</strong> that federal RHTP approval cannot address. North Carolina&rsquo;s SDOH advantage derived from the combination of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Federal Medicaid waiver authority (CMS approval for HOP)</li>
<li>State appropriations for HOP implementation (~$175M biennially)</li>
<li>RHTP funding for coordination infrastructure</li>
</ul>
<p>H.R. 1 maintained federal RHTP funding. CMS extended the 1115 waiver allowing HOP. But the state legislature discontinued HOP appropriations. Two of three funding streams continue; the one paying for actual services stopped.</p>

<p><strong>The employment question</strong>:</p>
<p>North Carolina CHW certification exists. Training capacity exists. The question is who employs CHWs after training.</p>
<p><strong>Medicaid managed care</strong> represents the primary sustainability mechanism. NC Medicaid permits MCOs to count CHW services within Advanced Medical Homes and care management programs. If MCOs integrate CHWs into care models, employment continues post-RHTP through Medicaid payment.</p>
<p><strong>HOP Network Leads</strong> employed CHWs for SDOH intervention delivery. That employment pathway closed with HOP discontinuation. CHWs trained for HOP-style social care integration need alternative employers.</p>
<p><strong>Hub-based employment</strong> may provide transition pathway. If Hub Leads employ CHWs for hub network coordination, RHTP funding supports CHW employment directly. But Hub Lead employment depends on sustained RHTP funding through 2030.</p>

<p><strong>The sustainability hierarchy</strong>:</p>
<p>Technology infrastructure built before RHTP continues through established funding. Technology infrastructure expanded through RHTP likely continues because it integrates into existing systems.</p>
<p>Workforce investments produce trained professionals who persist regardless of funding source. CHWs certified remain certified. Providers completing training remain trained.</p>
<p>Coordination infrastructure depends on ongoing funding. Hub Lead organizations, coordination staffing, and regional governance require continuous investment. No post-2030 funding mechanism exists for hub maintenance.</p>
<p>Service delivery requires continuous operational funding. RHTP cannot fund ongoing social care services. HOP discontinuation demonstrates state unwillingness to sustain social care service delivery investment. Post-2030 service delivery survival probability approaches zero absent policy reversal.</p>

<p><strong>Coverage losses under work requirements</strong>:</p>
<p>H.R. 1 imposes work requirements for &ldquo;able-bodied&rdquo; Medicaid beneficiaries effective January 1, 2027. North Carolina&rsquo;s expansion population of 650,000+ includes substantial numbers who may fail verification requirements not because they lack work but because documentation processes fail.</p>
<p><strong>The documentation burden</strong>: Agricultural workers, seasonal employees, gig economy participants, and self-employed individuals often lack employer-verified work documentation. Administrative disenrollment from paperwork failures, not actual work status, historically drives coverage losses in work requirement programs.</p>
<p><strong>Rural populations face disproportionate impact</strong>. Rural employment patterns include more agricultural work, more self-employment, and more seasonal variation. Work requirements designed around traditional employer relationships disadvantage rural workforce patterns.</p>
<p><strong>Hospital revenue implications</strong>:</p>
<p>Ten North Carolina hospitals face closure risk according to Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform analysis. Six face <strong>immediate risk within two to three years</strong>. These facilities operate on margins that cannot absorb revenue reductions from Medicaid cuts, coverage losses, or work requirement disenrollment.</p>
<p><strong>The cascade North Carolina experienced before</strong>:</p>
<p>Martin General Hospital closed in August 2023 after mounting losses reached $30 million. The closure left Martin County without emergency care. The community attempts to reopen as a Rural Emergency Hospital, potentially the first such conversion from complete closure. H.R. 1 creates conditions that could produce additional Martin General closures across the state.</p>
<h3 id="the-expansion-paradox-intensified">The Expansion Paradox Intensified<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-expansion-paradox-intensified">#</a></h3>
<p>North Carolina expanded Medicaid in December 2023, providing coverage to 650,000+ residents including over 233,000 from rural communities. The expansion stabilized rural hospital finances after decades of erosion.</p>
<p><strong>Now H.R. 1 threatens to unwind expansion gains</strong> through work requirements, eligibility verification burdens, and FMAP reductions. North Carolina&rsquo;s recent expansion enrollees face the highest disenrollment risk because their coverage is newest and their administrative engagement patterns are least established.</p>
<p><strong>The timeline collision</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>December 2023: Expansion launches</li>
<li>July 2025: Work requirements take effect</li>
<li>2026-2030: RHTP implementation</li>
<li>2027 onward: Work requirement enforcement, eligibility reverification</li>
<li>2030: RHTP ends, Medicaid cuts reach maximum impact</li>
</ul>
<p>North Carolina attempts transformation during the precise window when the coverage foundation beneath transformation erodes. Hub-based coordination assumes covered populations. Work requirements reduce covered populations. The coordination infrastructure serves shrinking populations.</p>

<p>North Carolina&rsquo;s RHTP application presents <strong>regional hub coordination</strong> as the transformative innovation. NC ROOTS appears throughout as the mechanism forcing integration across initiatives. Social care integration receives prominent treatment, referencing HOP success and NCCARE360 deployment.</p>
<p>The application rhetoric suggests:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coordination generates efficiency exceeding isolated investment</li>
<li>Existing social care infrastructure provides implementation advantage</li>
<li>Hub-based governance ensures community voice in regional priorities</li>
<li>Value-based payment transition creates sustainability</li>

<p><strong>Technology receives nearly equivalent investment to hub establishment</strong>. The state prioritizes infrastructure deployment producing measurable outcomes over coordination mechanisms requiring years to demonstrate value.</p>
<p><strong>Social care integration</strong> appears throughout initiative descriptions but receives <strong>no dedicated funding stream</strong>. SDOH screening embeds in hub operations. Navigation coordinates through hub staff. Service delivery depends on resources outside RHTP scope.</p>
<h3 id="the-real-theory-of-change">The Real Theory of Change<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-real-theory-of-change">#</a></h3>
<p>North Carolina&rsquo;s actual theory of change differs from stated theory:</p>
<p><strong>Stated theory</strong>: Regional coordination transforms rural healthcare delivery by forcing integration, building community voice into governance, and creating sustainable systems through value-based payment transition.</p>
<p><strong>Revealed theory</strong>: Technology connectivity and workforce training produce demonstrable outcomes satisfying federal scoring requirements. Hub coordination provides administrative framework for deploying federal funds. Social care data capture meets federal SDOH documentation requirements. Service delivery remains someone else&rsquo;s problem.</p>
<p>The gap between rhetoric and resources reflects practical constraints, not cynical deception. North Carolina genuinely wishes to integrate social care. The state simply cannot fund social care service delivery at HOP scale through RHTP, and the General Assembly refused to fund HOP continuation. Stated priorities encounter resource reality.</p>
<h3 id="social-care-rhetoric-versus-funded-reality">Social Care Rhetoric Versus Funded Reality<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#social-care-rhetoric-versus-funded-reality">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Application language</strong>: &ldquo;Build on NC Healthy Opportunities Pilots and leverage state&rsquo;s national leadership in Medicaid SDOH integration&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Funded reality</strong>: HOP discontinued July 2025. RHTP funds referral infrastructure. Service delivery unfunded.</p>
<p><strong>Application language</strong>: &ldquo;NCCARE360 provides statewide platform for closed-loop referral coordination&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Funded reality</strong>: True. Platform funded. What happens after referral depends on CBO capacity that HOP discontinuation reduced.</p>
<p><strong>Application language</strong>: &ldquo;Hub-based navigation coordinators connect clinical referrals to community resources&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Funded reality</strong>: Navigation staff funded. Community resources may lack capacity to serve additional referrals.</p>
<p>The rhetoric accurately describes infrastructure. It elides the service delivery gap that infrastructure cannot bridge.</p>

<h3 id="what-north-carolinas-approach-teaches">What North Carolina&rsquo;s Approach Teaches<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-north-carolinas-approach-teaches">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Build on existing infrastructure rather than creating new</strong>: North Carolina&rsquo;s technology advantage derives from platforms deployed before RHTP. States starting CIE platform procurement in 2026 lose two to three years. Build what you need before needing it.</p>
<p><strong>Regional alignment with existing administrative structures works</strong>: Aligning hubs with Medicaid managed care regions creates coordination rather than conflict. States creating hub boundaries that contradict existing geographic arrangements generate confusion.</p>
<p><strong>Workforce infrastructure requires ongoing institutional commitment</strong>: NC AHEC operated for decades before RHTP. The training capacity exists because the state invested in it long-term. States creating workforce pipelines solely through RHTP face sustainability challenges.</p>
<p><strong>State budget politics can undermine federal investment</strong>: North Carolina has the most advanced Medicaid SDOH program in the nation. The General Assembly discontinued it. Federal RHTP funding cannot overcome state unwillingness to sustain complementary investment.</p>
<h3 id="transferable-elements">Transferable Elements<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#transferable-elements">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Statewide CIE platform deployment</strong> before RHTP creates implementation advantage. Other states can accelerate platform adoption now rather than waiting for RHTP timelines.</p>
<p><strong>Managed care contract integration</strong> provides participation incentive beyond voluntary goodwill. States with Medicaid managed care can incorporate hub expectations into MCO contracts.</p>
<p><strong>Diversified workforce institution partnerships</strong> create sustainability pathways. Community colleges, AHEC programs, and academic medical centers with multiple funding streams sustain programs when RHTP ends.</p>
<h3 id="context-specific-elements">Context-Specific Elements<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#context-specific-elements">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Recent Medicaid expansion</strong> provides measurement opportunity other states lack. Non-expansion states cannot demonstrate before-and-after outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Existing CHW certification infrastructure</strong> reduces training development time. States without established certification must build credentialing systems.</p>
<p><strong>Healthy Opportunities Pilots experience</strong> generated lessons and relationships even though funding discontinued. States without prior SDOH pilot experience lack institutional learning.</p>
<h3 id="what-to-avoid">What to Avoid<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-to-avoid">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Assuming coordination alone generates efficiency</strong>: Hub administration costs money. Coordination meetings take time. Whether coordination benefits exceed coordination costs depends on implementation details that optimistic projections assume.</p>
<p><strong>Promising social care integration without service delivery funding</strong>: North Carolina&rsquo;s application references HOP while HOP funding faces discontinuation. Overpromising social care when service delivery funding does not exist creates expectations RHTP cannot meet.</p>
<p><strong>Voluntary participation assumptions</strong>: Providers facing existential financial pressure may not volunteer for additional coordination requirements. States relying on voluntary engagement may achieve less participation than plans assume.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>North Carolina enters RHTP implementation with <strong>genuine advantages and genuine constraints</strong>. The advantages are real: statewide technology platforms, established workforce infrastructure, Medicaid managed care alignment, recent expansion momentum, and institutional experience with SDOH integration. Few states possess comparable starting position.</p>
<p>The constraints are equally real. Healthy Opportunities Pilots discontinuation removes the service delivery complement to screening infrastructure. State Medicaid budget volatility creates provider uncertainty. Hub establishment timelines assume rapid progress that coordination governance rarely achieves. And the Medicaid math remains unforgiving: <strong>RHTP replaces 27% of projected rural hospital losses</strong> while the other 73% erodes the foundation beneath transformation.</p>
<p><strong>What survives</strong>: Technology infrastructure integrated into ongoing operations. Trained workforce professionals who practice regardless of funding source. CIE platform capacity maintained through established organizations. Behavioral health integration built into Medicaid managed care.</p>
<p><strong>What struggles</strong>: Hub governance requiring organizational development time RHTP timelines may not allow. Value-based payment transitions requiring market conditions that Medicaid cuts undermine. Coordination benefits dependent on voluntary participation that competing priorities may prevent.</p>
<p><strong>What does not survive</strong>: Social care service delivery at anything approaching HOP scale. CBO capacity building for intervention delivery. Closed-loop resolution beyond referral documentation. The promise that screening translates to services.</p>
<p><strong>The honest assessment</strong>: North Carolina will implement RHTP components successfully. Technology connectivity will expand. Workforce training will occur. Hubs will eventually establish. The state&rsquo;s existing infrastructure provides implementation advantages that produce visible progress.</p>
<p>But progress is not transformation. <strong>Hub-based coordination cannot overcome the simultaneous erosion of Medicaid coverage</strong> that provides the financial foundation for rural healthcare. North Carolina invests $213 million annually in transformation while losing access to $4.99 billion annually in Medicaid support. The hubs coordinate activity within a shrinking resource environment.</p>
<p>The coordination bet has merit. Regional integration does generate efficiencies. Local governance does improve decision-making. Existing infrastructure does enable faster implementation.</p>
<p>Whether efficiency gains from coordination exceed efficiency losses from Medicaid erosion determines whether North Carolina&rsquo;s rural residents emerge from RHTP better or worse off than they entered. The mathematics favor erosion. Implementation excellence may narrow but cannot close the gap.</p>
<p>North Carolina provides the test case for whether <strong>model state infrastructure</strong> can produce different outcomes than structural constraints predict. The answer matters for every state attempting transformation against the same headwinds.</p>
