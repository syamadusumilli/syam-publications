  "articleBody": "The state with the nation’s worst rural hospital crisis now has one of its highest RHTP awards. Whether transformation can outpace collapse remains the defining question.\nIntroduction Kansas received $221,898,008 for FY2026, the sixth highest award nationally and $21.9 million above the $200 million baseline. For a state where 47% of rural hospitals are at risk of closure and 30 face immediate collapse within two to three years, this funding arrives at a moment of existential urgency. The five-year projected investment of approximately $1.1 billion represents the largest dedicated rural health investment in state history.\nThe state’s 867,340 rural residents (29.5% of the population) translate this award to approximately $256 per rural resident annually, above the national average of roughly $164. This favorable per-capita position reflects both strong application scoring and the formula’s treatment of geographic sparsity. Kansas spans 82,278 square miles with 50 of 105 counties classified as 100% rural by the Census Bureau.\nYet Kansas remains a Medicaid non-expansion state, one of only ten nationwide. An estimated 39,000 Kansans remain trapped in the coverage gap, and repeated legislative efforts to expand eligibility have failed despite 70% voter support. This creates a fundamental tension: RHTP investment flows into a coverage structure designed to fail rural residents who earn too little for marketplace subsidies but too much for traditional Medicaid.\nThe central question for Kansas: Can transformation funding stabilize hospitals that close primarily because patients cannot afford to pay for care?\nRural Health Landscape Infrastructure Inventory\nKansas operates one of the nation’s most extensive Critical Access Hospital networks relative to population. The state’s 82 CAHs represent more than two-thirds of all Kansas hospitals, creating both safety net coverage and systemic financial fragility.\nFacility Type Count Context Critical Access Hospitals 82 2/3 of all state hospitals Rural Emergency Hospitals 3 New designation, limited adoption Rural Health Clinics 182 Primary care distribution FQHCs (rural sites) 54+ Safety net presence Short-term/PPS Hospitals (rural) 21 Including regional centers Total Rural Hospitals 104 Basis for risk assessment The Kansas Hospital Association reports that 82% of the state’s rural hospitals recorded financial losses on patient services in 2023. The Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform identifies 30 Kansas rural hospitals at immediate risk of closure and up to 60 at overall risk, giving Kansas the highest concentration of at-risk rural hospitals in the nation by percentage.\nGeographic Context\nKansas spans from the Kansas City metropolitan edge to the Colorado border, a distance of approximately 400 miles. The population concentrates in the northeast quadrant anchored by Kansas City, Topeka, and Wichita, leaving western Kansas increasingly sparse. Frontier counties in the west average fewer than six residents per square mile.\n50 of 105 counties are classified as 100% rural 80 counties lost population between 2010 and 2020 Western Kansas experienced population decline of 5-7% per decade Southwest Kansas contains the state’s most diverse population (47.3% minority) Workforce Crisis\nThe provider shortage in rural Kansas is severe and worsening:\n0.8 physicians per 1,000 residents in rural counties versus 1.5 in urban areas Staff vacancy rates remain 60% higher than pre-pandemic levels Most rural counties carry Health Professional Shortage Area designations for primary care, dental, and mental health Southeast and southwest regions experience the most acute primary care physician shortages Kansas ranks among states restricting nurse practitioner independent practice, limiting one workaround The 2025 Kansas Health Care Workforce Report documented turnover rates that have not recovered to pre-pandemic baselines. Rural facilities struggle to compete with urban compensation and lifestyle amenities, creating recruitment challenges that funding alone cannot resolve.\nHealth Outcomes\nRural Kansans experience the disparities characteristic of the national rural health crisis:\nIndicator Rural Kansas Context Uninsured rate (ages 0-64) 11.8% Higher than urban 9.6% Chronic disease burden Above national average Diabetes, heart disease Mental health provider access Limited Multi-county HPSA designations Maternal health services Declining 17 OB unit closures in review period Kansas lost obstetric services at 17 rural hospitals between 2014 and 2023, among the highest losses nationally per the Chartis 2025 State of the State report. Access to chemotherapy in rural Kansas similarly declined, with facilities dropping services that require specialist staffing and expensive equipment.\nRHTP Award and Context Funding Position\nMetric Value Context FY2026 Award $221,898,008 6th highest nationally Baseline Component $100,000,000 Equal across all states Workload Component $121,898,008 Based on rurality and application Five-Year Projected Total ~$1.1 billion Subject to annual performance Rural Population 867,340 29.5% of state total Per Rural Resident ~$256 Above $164 national average Kansas’s workload allocation of $121.9 million exceeded the baseline by 22%, indicating strong performance on CMS scoring factors including rurality metrics, state policy alignment, and initiative quality. The state earned full credit for having no Certificate of Need requirements and favorable telehealth licensing policies.\nMedicaid Context\nKansas has not expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. The state remains one of ten where expansion has not been implemented, leaving an estimated 39,000 adults in the coverage gap: too poor for marketplace subsidies, ineligible for traditional Medicaid.\nGovernor Laura Kelly has proposed expansion annually since taking office in 2019. The Healthcare Access for Working Kansans (HAWK) Act introduced in 2025 included work requirements in an attempted compromise, but legislative leadership has blocked advancement. Despite sustained 70%+ public support documented in polling, political opposition remains entrenched.\nThe consequences for rural hospitals are direct:\nCommercial payers in Kansas pay less than neighboring states per 2024 Kansas Hospital Association analysis Uncompensated care levels exceed those in expansion states Patients carry higher bad debt burdens, often avoiding care entirely Hospital margins have no coverage-based floor that expansion provides The One Big Beautiful Bill Act that authorized RHTP simultaneously implements Medicaid cuts projected to reduce federal payments starting in 2028. The provider tax increase CMS approved in 2025 provides temporary relief, but structural underpayment persists.\nPer-Capita Analysis\nKansas’s $256 per rural resident exceeds the national average but trails frontier states receiving formula advantages:\nState Per Rural Resident Award Wyoming ~$485 $199M / 410K Montana ~$375 $234M / 624K Kansas ~$256 $222M / 867K Missouri ~$115 $216M / 1.88M Texas ~$60 $281M / 4.7M Kansas occupies a middle position: better per-capita funding than large-population states penalized by the scale formula, but less than sparsely populated frontier states.\nState Approach Governance Structure\nThe Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) serves as lead agency under Secretary Janet Stanek. An interagency team includes the Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services (KDADS) under Secretary Laura Howard. This structure reflects the overlap between rural health transformation and aging services given rural Kansas demographics.\nGovernor Kelly established the Kansas Rural Health Innovation Alliance (KRHIA) to provide stakeholder oversight for application development and ongoing implementation. KRHIA convened multiple sessions during the compressed application timeline, providing input on initiative design and governance.\nThe University of Kansas Health System Care Collaborative serves as implementation partner. This existing network, funded initially by a $12.4 million CMS Innovation Center grant in 2014, now includes 91 provider organizations across 79 of Kansas’s 105 counties. The Care Collaborative encompasses 72 of 75 rural Kansas counties with hospitals, creating statewide coordination infrastructure few states can match.\nKDHE will create four new RHTP-funded positions: section director, program manager, and two additional administrative staff. Administrative costs will remain below standard percentages to maximize funds reaching communities.\nStrategic Framework\nKansas organized its application around five strategic priorities:\n1. Expand Primary and Secondary Prevention Programs\nFocus on reducing chronic disease rates through expanded access to preventive screenings, behavioral health interventions, and wellness programming. Kansas’s chronic disease burden, particularly diabetes and heart disease, drives disproportionate hospital utilization that prevention could reduce.\n2. Secure Local Access to Primary Care\nEnsure rural Kansans retain primary care access as the first point of healthcare contact. This initiative addresses the fundamental access challenge that drives emergency department utilization and delayed care.\n3. Build a Sustainable Rural Health Workforce\nComprehensive workforce strategy targeting recruitment, retention, training, and career exploration. Kansas seeks to ensure rural areas have primary care, dental, and behavioral health providers while easing nursing and allied health shortages.\nSpecific components include:\nRecruitment and Retention Programs: Five projects targeting gaps through contracted qualified organizations Career Exploration Program: Four projects building student awareness of healthcare careers, bridging awareness to enrollment and employment Workforce Coordination: Leveraging existing KDHE partnership with the University of Kansas Care Collaborative 4. Enable Value-Based Care\nAmbitious target: 100% of rural Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries in accountable care relationships by 2031. This shifts focus from volume to outcomes, theoretically improving patient health while lowering total cost of care.\nThe Care Collaborative’s existing clinically integrated network provides infrastructure for value-based care transition. However, rural VBC success nationally remains limited, and the timeline is aggressive.\n5. Harness Data and Technology\nEnable rural Kansas providers to expand telehealth, remote monitoring, and consumer-facing technologies while engaging in data sharing and analysis. The initiative addresses the technological gaps that limit rural provider capacity and patient engagement.\nProgram and Funding Distribution Kansas has not yet published detailed initiative-level budgets. The state scheduled its first CMS post-award follow-up meeting for January 12, 2026, to discuss budget finalization. KRHIA met January 13, 2026, to continue implementation planning.\nProgram Area Estimated Focus Implementing Structure Prevention Programs Chronic disease reduction State contracts with qualified organizations Primary Care Access Local access sustainment Care Collaborative coordination Workforce Development Recruitment, retention, training Multiple project contracts Value-Based Care ACO transition, quality metrics Care Collaborative infrastructure Data and Technology Telehealth, remote monitoring, analytics Technology procurement, provider grants Key Implementation Partners\nOrganization Role KDHE Lead agency, grant administration KDADS Aging and disability coordination University of Kansas Health System Care Collaborative Primary implementation partner, 91-provider network Kansas Hospital Association Hospital stakeholder coordination Kansas Association of Community Health Centers FQHC engagement Kansas Rural Health Innovation Alliance Ongoing stakeholder governance The Care Collaborative’s role as primary implementation partner distinguishes Kansas from states building new infrastructure. The network’s decade of operation and coverage of 79 counties provides immediate coordination capacity.\nSocial Care Integration Kansas’s application emphasizes addressing root causes of disease rather than traditional clinical intervention alone. However, explicit SDOH/HRSN framework language, Community Health Worker deployment targets, and Community Information Exchange platform specifications are limited in publicly available documentation.\nComponent Included in Plan Detail Level Likely Funded? SDOH/HRSN Screening Implicit in prevention Limited specificity Unknown CHW Programs Not emphasized No workforce targets At risk CIE Platform Not specified No vendor identification At risk Social Needs Navigation Within primary care Embedded in access initiative Partial The state’s prevention focus implicitly addresses social determinants through behavioral health interventions and wellness programming. However, the absence of explicit HRSN language, CIE procurement, or CHW deployment targets suggests social care integration may remain secondary to clinical and workforce priorities.\nKansas Hospital Association spokesperson Cindy Samuelson noted the hope that RHTP funds will bring structural changes, including addressing root causes of disease. Whether this translates to funded social care infrastructure remains to be seen as budget finalization proceeds.\nAssessment Strengths\nExisting Coordination Infrastructure. The Care Collaborative’s 91-provider network covering 79 counties provides implementation capacity that states building from scratch lack. A decade of operation has established trust and operational protocols.\nStrong Application Performance. The $121.9 million workload allocation (22% above baseline) indicates CMS recognized application quality. Full credit for no Certificate of Need requirements and favorable telehealth policies enhanced scoring.\nFavorable Per-Capita Position. The $256 per rural resident exceeds the national average, providing more resources per person than large-population states facing the scale penalty.\nBipartisan Stakeholder Support. KRHIA engagement included diverse stakeholders, and hospital and provider associations support transformation efforts regardless of political alignment on Medicaid expansion.\nNo Administrative Fragmentation. KDHE as unified lead agency with Care Collaborative as primary partner creates clear accountability rather than dispersed implementation across multiple state agencies.\nVulnerabilities\nMedicaid Non-Expansion. The fundamental coverage gap undermines transformation potential. Hospitals that close primarily because patients cannot pay will continue facing that pressure regardless of transformation investment. Kansas’s uncompensated care burden exceeds expansion states, and no RHTP initiative addresses this structural deficit.\nHospital Closure Velocity. With 30 hospitals at immediate risk and 60 at overall risk, closures may outpace transformation. RHTP cannot directly fund hospital operating losses, and stabilization through transformation takes time Kansas may not have.\nWorkforce Recruitment Reality. Training programs and career exploration pipelines take years to produce providers. Kansas’s immediate workforce crisis requires retention strategies while longer-term supply solutions develop.\nValue-Based Care Uncertainty. The 100% accountable care target by 2031 is aggressive. Rural VBC success nationally remains limited, and infrastructure for meaningful population health management is thin in many Kansas communities.\nPolitical Medicaid Dynamics. Sustained legislative opposition to expansion means RHTP implementation occurs within a coverage structure that limits impact. Even if hospitals transform operations, patients who cannot afford care remain locked out of the system.\nSustainability Prospects\nKansas faces the 2030 cliff like all states: what survives when five-year federal funding ends?\nElements with sustainability potential:\nValue-based care relationships that payers continue beyond RHTP Workforce pipelines that produce providers who remain in rural Kansas Technology infrastructure with ongoing utility and provider investment Care Collaborative network coordination that continues under alternative funding Elements requiring ongoing support:\nPrevention programs dependent on federal dollars Workforce recruitment incentives without successor funding Training program capacity beyond initial cohorts Data analytics infrastructure requiring maintenance and updates The state has not articulated post-2030 sustainability planning in public documents. The Care Collaborative provides a natural home for sustained coordination, but specific transition mechanisms remain undefined.\nCritical Success Factors\nRapid implementation: Kansas must deploy funds quickly given closure velocity; delayed implementation means fewer hospitals survive to benefit Workforce retention: Preventing additional departures while pipelines develop Value-based care execution: Demonstrating outcomes that justify continued payer support Care Collaborative capacity: Whether 91-provider network can absorb transformation demands Legislative cooperation: Whether state policymakers support transformation implementation or create obstacles Conclusion Kansas received RHTP funding commensurate with its crisis severity: the state with the nation’s highest percentage of at-risk rural hospitals secured the sixth-highest award. The $221.9 million annually for five years, combined with existing Care Collaborative infrastructure, positions Kansas for implementation capacity exceeding many states.\nYet the fundamental tension persists. Kansas hospitals close because patients cannot pay, and Kansas has refused to accept federal funding that would enable payment. RHTP investment flows into a coverage structure designed around limitation rather than access. Prevention programs, workforce development, and value-based care transition all assume patients can access the system being transformed.\nThe Care Collaborative provides genuine advantage. Ninety-one providers across 79 counties creates coordination infrastructure that took a decade to build. Kansas need not construct new relationships; it can leverage existing ones. That head start matters when 30 hospitals face immediate closure risk.\nThe 2031 value-based care target is ambitious. If achieved, Kansas would transition rural Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries into payment models that theoretically incentivize quality over volume. If unrealistic, the target creates measurement failure rather than transformation success.\nWhat to watch: Hospital closure announcements in 2026 will reveal whether transformation begins before collapse completes. Kansas cannot afford to lose 30 more hospitals during the transition period.\nCross-References\nRHTP 2A: RHTP Structure and Rules RHTP 2B: Medicaid Architecture and the $911B Question RHTP 2H: The 2030 Cliff RHTP 3.MO: Missouri (regional comparison, expansion contrast) RHTP 3.NE: Nebraska (regional comparison) RHTP 3.OK: Oklahoma (regional comparison) Sources Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. “CMS Announces $50 Billion in Awards to Strengthen Rural Health in All 50 States.” CMS Newsroom, 29 Dec. 2025, www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-announces-50-billion-awards-strengthen-rural-health-all-50-states.\nCenter for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform. “Rural Hospital Closures and Risk of Closure.” CHQPR, 2025, chqpr.org/downloads/Rural_Hospitals_at_Risk_of_Closing.pdf.\nChartis. “2025 Rural Health State of the State.” Chartis, 2025, www.chartis.com/insights/2025-rural-health-state-state.\nFierce Healthcare. “Rural Health Transformation Program Awards Announcedâ€”Here’s Who’s Getting the Most in FY2026.” Fierce Healthcare, 29 Dec. 2025, www.fiercehealthcare.com/providers/rural-health-transformation-program-awards-announced-heres-whos-getting-most.\nHealth Management Associates. “CMS Announces Rural Health Transformation Program Awardees.” HMAIS, 10 Jan. 2026, www.healthmanagement.com/blog/cms-announces-rural-health-transformation-program-awardees/.\nKansas Department of Health and Environment. “Rural Health Transformation Program.” KDHE, 2025, www.kdhe.ks.gov/2361/Rural-Health-Transformation-Program.\nKansas Department of Health and Environment. “State of Kansas Rural Health Transformation Plan Project Narrative.” KDHE, Nov. 2025, www.kdhe.ks.gov/DocumentCenter/View/52681/06_KS_RHT_26_001_Project-Narrative.\nKansas Health Institute. “2020 Census Data Reveal a Changing Kansas.” KHI, Nov. 2022, www.khi.org/articles/2021-2020-census-data-reveal-a-changing-kansas/.\nKansas Health Institute. “Exploring Federal Priorities in the Rural Health Transformation Program.” KHI, 2 Oct. 2025, www.khi.org/articles/exploring-federal-priorities-in-the-rural-health-transformation-program/.\nKansas Health Institute. “Medicaid Expansion in Kansas: Impacts of Federal Policy Options Under Consideration and Updated Estimates.” KHI, 4 June 2025, www.khi.org/articles/medicaid-expansion-in-kansas-impacts-of-federal-policy-options-under-consideration-and-updated-estimates/.\nKansas Health Science University. “Key Challenges to Health Care Access in Rural Kansas.” KHSU, 8 Sept. 2025, www.kansashsu.org/blog/health-care-access-challenges-rural/.\nKansas Legislative Research Department. “Responding to the Shortage of Health Care Workers in Rural Kansas.” KLRD, 27 Nov. 2023, klrd.gov/2023/11/27/shortage-health-care-workers-in-rural-kansas/.\nKansas Reflector. “Kansas Secures $221 Million Federal Grant to Boost Rural Health as Federal Cuts Hit.” Kansas Reflector, 30 Dec. 2025, kansasreflector.com/2025/12/30/kansas-secures-221-million-federal-grant-to-boost-rural-health-as-federal-cuts-hit/.\nKansas Reflector. “Kansas’ Unrivaled Rural Hospital Crisis: 58% at Risk of Closing, 82% Lost Money on Patient Care.” Kansas Reflector, 12 Dec. 2023, kansasreflector.com/2023/12/12/kansas-unrivaled-rural-hospital-crisis-58-at-risk-of-closing-82-lost-money-on-patient-care/.\nKCUR. “Medicaid Cuts Are a Ticking Time Bomb for Rural Kansas Hospitals.

<p><em>The state with the nation&rsquo;s worst rural hospital crisis now has one of its highest RHTP awards. Whether transformation can outpace collapse remains the defining question.</em></p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#introduction">#</a></h2>
<p>Kansas received <strong>$221,898,008 for FY2026</strong>, the sixth highest award nationally and <strong>$21.9 million above the $200 million baseline</strong>. For a state where 47% of rural hospitals are at risk of closure and 30 face immediate collapse within two to three years, this funding arrives at a moment of existential urgency. The five-year projected investment of approximately $1.1 billion represents the largest dedicated rural health investment in state history.</p>
<p>The state&rsquo;s <strong>867,340 rural residents</strong> (29.5% of the population) translate this award to approximately <strong>$256 per rural resident</strong> annually, above the national average of roughly $164. This favorable per-capita position reflects both strong application scoring and the formula&rsquo;s treatment of geographic sparsity. Kansas spans 82,278 square miles with 50 of 105 counties classified as 100% rural by the Census Bureau.</p>
<p>Yet Kansas remains a <strong>Medicaid non-expansion state</strong>, one of only ten nationwide. An estimated 39,000 Kansans remain trapped in the coverage gap, and repeated legislative efforts to expand eligibility have failed despite 70% voter support. This creates a fundamental tension: <strong>RHTP investment flows into a coverage structure designed to fail rural residents who earn too little for marketplace subsidies but too much for traditional Medicaid</strong>.</p>
<p>The central question for Kansas: Can transformation funding stabilize hospitals that close primarily because patients cannot afford to pay for care?</p>

<p><strong>Infrastructure Inventory</strong></p>
<p>Kansas operates one of the nation&rsquo;s most extensive Critical Access Hospital networks relative to population. The state&rsquo;s 82 CAHs represent more than two-thirds of all Kansas hospitals, creating both safety net coverage and systemic financial fragility.</p>

<p>The <strong>Kansas Hospital Association</strong> reports that 82% of the state&rsquo;s rural hospitals recorded financial losses on patient services in 2023. The Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform identifies <strong>30 Kansas rural hospitals at immediate risk of closure</strong> and up to 60 at overall risk, giving Kansas the highest concentration of at-risk rural hospitals in the nation by percentage.</p>
<p><strong>Geographic Context</strong></p>
<p>Kansas spans from the Kansas City metropolitan edge to the Colorado border, a distance of approximately 400 miles. The population concentrates in the northeast quadrant anchored by Kansas City, Topeka, and Wichita, leaving western Kansas increasingly sparse. Frontier counties in the west average fewer than six residents per square mile.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>50 of 105 counties</strong> are classified as 100% rural</li>
<li><strong>80 counties</strong> lost population between 2010 and 2020</li>
<li>Western Kansas experienced population decline of 5-7% per decade</li>
<li>Southwest Kansas contains the state&rsquo;s most diverse population (47.3% minority)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Workforce Crisis</strong></p>
<p>The provider shortage in rural Kansas is severe and worsening:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>0.8 physicians per 1,000 residents</strong> in rural counties versus 1.5 in urban areas</li>
<li><strong>Staff vacancy rates remain 60% higher</strong> than pre-pandemic levels</li>
<li>Most rural counties carry <strong>Health Professional Shortage Area designations</strong> for primary care, dental, and mental health</li>
<li>Southeast and southwest regions experience the most acute primary care physician shortages</li>
<li>Kansas ranks among states restricting nurse practitioner independent practice, limiting one workaround</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>2025 Kansas Health Care Workforce Report</strong> documented turnover rates that have not recovered to pre-pandemic baselines. Rural facilities struggle to compete with urban compensation and lifestyle amenities, creating recruitment challenges that funding alone cannot resolve.</p>
<p><strong>Health Outcomes</strong></p>
<p>Rural Kansans experience the disparities characteristic of the national rural health crisis:</p>

<p>Kansas&rsquo;s workload allocation of <strong>$121.9 million</strong> exceeded the baseline by 22%, indicating strong performance on CMS scoring factors including rurality metrics, state policy alignment, and initiative quality. The state earned full credit for having no Certificate of Need requirements and favorable telehealth licensing policies.</p>
<p><strong>Medicaid Context</strong></p>
<p>Kansas has <strong>not expanded Medicaid</strong> under the Affordable Care Act. The state remains one of ten where expansion has not been implemented, leaving an estimated <strong>39,000 adults in the coverage gap</strong>: too poor for marketplace subsidies, ineligible for traditional Medicaid.</p>
<p>Governor Laura Kelly has proposed expansion annually since taking office in 2019. The <strong>Healthcare Access for Working Kansans (HAWK) Act</strong> introduced in 2025 included work requirements in an attempted compromise, but legislative leadership has blocked advancement. Despite sustained 70%+ public support documented in polling, political opposition remains entrenched.</p>
<p>The consequences for rural hospitals are direct:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Commercial payers in Kansas pay less than neighboring states</strong> per 2024 Kansas Hospital Association analysis</li>
<li>Uncompensated care levels exceed those in expansion states</li>
<li>Patients carry higher bad debt burdens, often avoiding care entirely</li>
<li>Hospital margins have no coverage-based floor that expansion provides</li>
</ul>
<p>The One Big Beautiful Bill Act that authorized RHTP simultaneously implements Medicaid cuts projected to reduce federal payments starting in 2028. The provider tax increase CMS approved in 2025 provides temporary relief, but structural underpayment persists.</p>

<p>Kansas occupies a middle position: better per-capita funding than large-population states penalized by the scale formula, but less than sparsely populated frontier states.</p>
<h2 id="state-approach">State Approach<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#state-approach">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Governance Structure</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE)</strong> serves as lead agency under Secretary Janet Stanek. An interagency team includes the <strong>Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services (KDADS)</strong> under Secretary Laura Howard. This structure reflects the overlap between rural health transformation and aging services given rural Kansas demographics.</p>
<p>Governor Kelly established the <strong>Kansas Rural Health Innovation Alliance (KRHIA)</strong> to provide stakeholder oversight for application development and ongoing implementation. KRHIA convened multiple sessions during the compressed application timeline, providing input on initiative design and governance.</p>
<p>The <strong>University of Kansas Health System Care Collaborative</strong> serves as implementation partner. This existing network, funded initially by a $12.4 million CMS Innovation Center grant in 2014, now includes <strong>91 provider organizations across 79 of Kansas&rsquo;s 105 counties</strong>. The Care Collaborative encompasses 72 of 75 rural Kansas counties with hospitals, creating statewide coordination infrastructure few states can match.</p>
<p>KDHE will create four new RHTP-funded positions: section director, program manager, and two additional administrative staff. Administrative costs will remain below standard percentages to maximize funds reaching communities.</p>
<p><strong>Strategic Framework</strong></p>
<p>Kansas organized its application around <strong>five strategic priorities</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>1. Expand Primary and Secondary Prevention Programs</strong></p>
<p>Focus on reducing chronic disease rates through expanded access to preventive screenings, behavioral health interventions, and wellness programming. Kansas&rsquo;s chronic disease burden, particularly diabetes and heart disease, drives disproportionate hospital utilization that prevention could reduce.</p>
<p><strong>2. Secure Local Access to Primary Care</strong></p>
<p>Ensure rural Kansans retain primary care access as the first point of healthcare contact. This initiative addresses the fundamental access challenge that drives emergency department utilization and delayed care.</p>
<p><strong>3. Build a Sustainable Rural Health Workforce</strong></p>
<p>Comprehensive workforce strategy targeting recruitment, retention, training, and career exploration. Kansas seeks to ensure rural areas have primary care, dental, and behavioral health providers while easing nursing and allied health shortages.</p>
<p>Specific components include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recruitment and Retention Programs</strong>: Five projects targeting gaps through contracted qualified organizations</li>
<li><strong>Career Exploration Program</strong>: Four projects building student awareness of healthcare careers, bridging awareness to enrollment and employment</li>
<li><strong>Workforce Coordination</strong>: Leveraging existing KDHE partnership with the University of Kansas Care Collaborative</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Enable Value-Based Care</strong></p>
<p>Ambitious target: <strong>100% of rural Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries in accountable care relationships by 2031</strong>. This shifts focus from volume to outcomes, theoretically improving patient health while lowering total cost of care.</p>
<p>The Care Collaborative&rsquo;s existing clinically integrated network provides infrastructure for value-based care transition. However, rural VBC success nationally remains limited, and the timeline is aggressive.</p>
<p><strong>5. Harness Data and Technology</strong></p>
<p>Enable rural Kansas providers to expand telehealth, remote monitoring, and consumer-facing technologies while engaging in data sharing and analysis. The initiative addresses the technological gaps that limit rural provider capacity and patient engagement.</p>
<h2 id="program-and-funding-distribution">Program and Funding Distribution<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#program-and-funding-distribution">#</a></h2>
<p>Kansas has not yet published detailed initiative-level budgets. The state scheduled its first CMS post-award follow-up meeting for January 12, 2026, to discuss budget finalization. KRHIA met January 13, 2026, to continue implementation planning.</p>

<p>The state&rsquo;s prevention focus implicitly addresses social determinants through behavioral health interventions and wellness programming. However, the absence of explicit HRSN language, CIE procurement, or CHW deployment targets suggests social care integration may remain secondary to clinical and workforce priorities.</p>
<p>Kansas Hospital Association spokesperson Cindy Samuelson noted the hope that RHTP funds will bring structural changes, including addressing root causes of disease. Whether this translates to funded social care infrastructure remains to be seen as budget finalization proceeds.</p>
<h2 id="assessment">Assessment<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#assessment">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
<p><strong>Existing Coordination Infrastructure</strong>. The Care Collaborative&rsquo;s 91-provider network covering 79 counties provides implementation capacity that states building from scratch lack. A decade of operation has established trust and operational protocols.</p>
<p><strong>Strong Application Performance</strong>. The $121.9 million workload allocation (22% above baseline) indicates CMS recognized application quality. Full credit for no Certificate of Need requirements and favorable telehealth policies enhanced scoring.</p>
<p><strong>Favorable Per-Capita Position</strong>. The $256 per rural resident exceeds the national average, providing more resources per person than large-population states facing the scale penalty.</p>
<p><strong>Bipartisan Stakeholder Support</strong>. KRHIA engagement included diverse stakeholders, and hospital and provider associations support transformation efforts regardless of political alignment on Medicaid expansion.</p>
<p><strong>No Administrative Fragmentation</strong>. KDHE as unified lead agency with Care Collaborative as primary partner creates clear accountability rather than dispersed implementation across multiple state agencies.</p>
<p><strong>Vulnerabilities</strong></p>
<p><strong>Medicaid Non-Expansion</strong>. The fundamental coverage gap undermines transformation potential. Hospitals that close primarily because patients cannot pay will continue facing that pressure regardless of transformation investment. Kansas&rsquo;s uncompensated care burden exceeds expansion states, and no RHTP initiative addresses this structural deficit.</p>
<p><strong>Hospital Closure Velocity</strong>. With 30 hospitals at immediate risk and 60 at overall risk, closures may outpace transformation. RHTP cannot directly fund hospital operating losses, and stabilization through transformation takes time Kansas may not have.</p>
<p><strong>Workforce Recruitment Reality</strong>. Training programs and career exploration pipelines take years to produce providers. Kansas&rsquo;s immediate workforce crisis requires retention strategies while longer-term supply solutions develop.</p>
<p><strong>Value-Based Care Uncertainty</strong>. The 100% accountable care target by 2031 is aggressive. Rural VBC success nationally remains limited, and infrastructure for meaningful population health management is thin in many Kansas communities.</p>
<p><strong>Political Medicaid Dynamics</strong>. Sustained legislative opposition to expansion means RHTP implementation occurs within a coverage structure that limits impact. Even if hospitals transform operations, patients who cannot afford care remain locked out of the system.</p>
<p><strong>Sustainability Prospects</strong></p>
<p>Kansas faces the <strong>2030 cliff</strong> like all states: what survives when five-year federal funding ends?</p>
<p><strong>Elements with sustainability potential</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Value-based care relationships that payers continue beyond RHTP</li>
<li>Workforce pipelines that produce providers who remain in rural Kansas</li>
<li>Technology infrastructure with ongoing utility and provider investment</li>
<li>Care Collaborative network coordination that continues under alternative funding</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Elements requiring ongoing support</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prevention programs dependent on federal dollars</li>
<li>Workforce recruitment incentives without successor funding</li>
<li>Training program capacity beyond initial cohorts</li>
<li>Data analytics infrastructure requiring maintenance and updates</li>
</ul>
<p>The state has not articulated post-2030 sustainability planning in public documents. The Care Collaborative provides a natural home for sustained coordination, but specific transition mechanisms remain undefined.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Success Factors</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Rapid implementation</strong>: Kansas must deploy funds quickly given closure velocity; delayed implementation means fewer hospitals survive to benefit</li>
<li><strong>Workforce retention</strong>: Preventing additional departures while pipelines develop</li>
<li><strong>Value-based care execution</strong>: Demonstrating outcomes that justify continued payer support</li>
<li><strong>Care Collaborative capacity</strong>: Whether 91-provider network can absorb transformation demands</li>
<li><strong>Legislative cooperation</strong>: Whether state policymakers support transformation implementation or create obstacles</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>Kansas received RHTP funding commensurate with its crisis severity: the state with the nation&rsquo;s highest percentage of at-risk rural hospitals secured the sixth-highest award. The $221.9 million annually for five years, combined with existing Care Collaborative infrastructure, positions Kansas for implementation capacity exceeding many states.</p>
<p>Yet the fundamental tension persists. <strong>Kansas hospitals close because patients cannot pay, and Kansas has refused to accept federal funding that would enable payment.</strong> RHTP investment flows into a coverage structure designed around limitation rather than access. Prevention programs, workforce development, and value-based care transition all assume patients can access the system being transformed.</p>
<p>The Care Collaborative provides genuine advantage. Ninety-one providers across 79 counties creates coordination infrastructure that took a decade to build. Kansas need not construct new relationships; it can leverage existing ones. That head start matters when 30 hospitals face immediate closure risk.</p>
<p>The 2031 value-based care target is ambitious. If achieved, Kansas would transition rural Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries into payment models that theoretically incentivize quality over volume. If unrealistic, the target creates measurement failure rather than transformation success.</p>
<p><strong>What to watch</strong>: Hospital closure announcements in 2026 will reveal whether transformation begins before collapse completes. Kansas cannot afford to lose 30 more hospitals during the transition period.</p>
