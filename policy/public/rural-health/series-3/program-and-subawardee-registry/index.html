  "articleBody": "Rural Health Transformation Project Version 3: January 2026\nPurpose This technical document serves as a master reference documenting who receives RHTP funding across all 50 states. The document enables:\nCross-state comparison of intermediary structures and program types Identification of key organizations operating in the RHTP ecosystem Analysis of funding distribution patterns from state agencies to end recipients Tracking of implementation models across different state contexts Understanding where money flows reveals more about RHTP implementation than headline award figures. States channel billions through intermediary organizations, and these distribution decisions shape what transformation actually looks like on the ground.\nSection 1: Intermediary Organization Inventory State Hospital Associations State hospital associations serve as primary intermediaries in most RHTP implementations, providing technical assistance to member hospitals, coordinating network formation, and advocating for policy alignment.\nState Hospital Association RHTP Role Estimated Contract Texas Texas Hospital Association Policy alignment, member engagement Key stakeholder Texas TORCH (Texas Organization of Rural \u0026 Community Hospitals) Rural hospital coordination, telehealth network $15-25M (est.) California California Hospital Association Technical assistance, network coordination, policy advocacy $8-12M Mississippi Mississippi Hospital Association Hospital engagement, technical assistance $10-15M (est.) Ohio Ohio Hospital Association Technical assistance, network coordination, CAH support $8-12M Georgia Georgia Hospital Association Technical assistance, policy coordination TBD Tennessee Tennessee Hospital Association Member coordination, policy alignment TBD Kentucky Kentucky Hospital Association Rural hospital coordination TBD Alabama Alabama Hospital Association Technical assistance, advocacy TBD Arkansas Arkansas Hospital Association Technical assistance, policy advocacy $15-25M North Carolina North Carolina Healthcare Association Member coordination TBD Oklahoma Oklahoma Hospital Association Member coordination TBD West Virginia West Virginia Hospital Association Hospital coordination, technical assistance $8-12M Missouri Missouri Hospital Association Hospital engagement, technical assistance Key stakeholder Louisiana Louisiana Hospital Association Technical assistance, advocacy, hospital coordination $15-20M Wisconsin Wisconsin Hospital Association Member coordination TBD Iowa Iowa Hospital Association Rural hospital coordination TBD Oregon Oregon Association of Hospitals and Health Systems Member coordination TBD Washington Washington State Hospital Association Member coordination TBD Montana Montana Hospital Association CAH coordination, advocacy TBD Arizona Arizona Hospital and Healthcare Association Technical assistance, CAH coordination TBD Pattern observed: States with stronger hospital association infrastructure tend to channel more RHTP funding through these intermediaries. Associations with existing rural health programs (TORCH in Texas, MHA in Missouri) receive larger roles.\nState Primary Care Associations Primary care associations coordinate FQHC networks and serve as intermediaries for primary care workforce and access initiatives.\nState Primary Care Association RHTP Role Estimated Contract Texas Texas Association of Community Health Centers FQHC coordination, implementation Key stakeholder California California Primary Care Association FQHC coordination, workforce pipeline, CHW deployment $6-10M Mississippi Mississippi Primary Health Care Association FQHC coordination TBD Ohio Ohio Association of Community Health Centers FQHC coordination, workforce pipeline, training sites $6-10M Georgia Georgia Primary Care Association FQHC coordination TBD Tennessee Tennessee Primary Care Association Primary care network TBD Kentucky Kentucky Primary Care Association FQHC coordination TBD Alabama Alabama Primary Health Care Association FQHC coordination TBD Arkansas Community Health Centers of Arkansas FQHC coordination, primary care access, training $20-30M North Carolina NC Community Health Center Association FQHC coordination, primary care network $12M Oklahoma Oklahoma Primary Care Association FQHC coordination TBD West Virginia West Virginia Primary Care Association FQHC network coordination, workforce pipeline, CHW deployment $6-10M Missouri Missouri Primary Care Association FQHC coordination, rural primary care network Key stakeholder Louisiana Louisiana Primary Care Association FQHC coordination, quality improvement $10-15M Wisconsin Wisconsin Primary Health Care Association FQHC coordination TBD Regional Health Foundations and Commissions Regional entities provide geographic coordination within states, particularly important in large states or those with distinct regional health needs.\nState Regional Entity Geography RHTP Role Estimated Contract Mississippi Delta Health Alliance Mississippi Delta Resource centers, workforce development, Promise Community programs $15-25M (est.)

States with established intermediary infrastructure (Missouri with ToRCH, Arkansas with UAMS/Arkansas Rural Health Partnership) channel more funding through these organizations. States relying on competitive procurement (Texas) direct more funding to individual providers.\nAdministrative Retention Rates State Administrative Budget Percentage FTEs Assessment Texas $20-25M 7-9% ~20 Moderate California ~$25M ~10% TBD Higher Arkansas $28.2M 2.8% TBD Low Ohio ~$20M ~10% TBD Higher Missouri ~$8M ~3% 20-25 Low West Virginia ~$10M ~5% TBD Low-Moderate Pattern observed: States with larger existing administrative infrastructure (Ohio Department of Health, California HCAI) retain higher administrative percentages. States with lean administration (Arkansas at 2.8%) may face implementation capacity constraints.\nPerformance-Based Versus Block Allocation State Performance-Based Block Allocation Notes California Transformative Payments (access metrics), quality metrics Infrastructure, training, network coordination Hybrid approach Texas Subawardee milestones Infrastructure investments Milestone-based Tennessee CHW organization accreditation County Health Council grants Accreditation-based North Carolina Hub performance metrics RHIF technology grants Hub outcomes Missouri ToRCH hub outcomes Infrastructure grants Hub-based Wisconsin CHW ROI study informs SPA Workforce, technology grants Research-informed Timeline Patterns for Fund Distribution Phase Texas California Arkansas Missouri Q1-Q2 FY2026 RFP development Network formation contracts Program establishment Hub expansion RFPs Q3-Q4 FY2026 Application, review, selection Technology procurement, workforce launch Initial RFPs, awards Initial awards Q1-Q2 FY2027 Contract execution, implementation Full network operations Initiative launches Full implementation Q3-Q4 FY2027 Full operation Performance assessment Scaling Performance assessment Section 4: Cross-State Program Comparison Similar Programs Across Multiple States Hub-and-Spoke Networks\nState Hub Model Number of Hubs Hub Functions Spoke Integration California Regional Hospital Networks 8 networks Specialty access, telehealth, coordination Rural hospitals, FQHCs Ohio Innovation Hubs 8-10 hubs Specialty pods, care coordination Spoke hospitals, clinics Missouri ToRCH Community Hubs 40+ hubs (from 6 pilot) Social needs coordination, referrals Community partners North Carolina Regional Innovation Hubs 6 regional hubs Network management, specialty access Primary care, FQHCs Kentucky Chronic Care Hubs Multiple Chronic disease management, navigation CHWs, primary care Alabama CRIS Regional Hubs TBD Community-based services Rural providers Workforce Loan Repayment Programs\nState Program Name Award Amount Service Commitment Disciplines Texas Workforce Pipeline Varies 5 years rural practice Physicians, NPs, PAs, nurses California Regional Facility Retention Varies Rural practice commitment Multiple disciplines Ohio Ohio Physician Loan Repayment (enhanced) Expanded 5 years rural Physicians, NPs, PAs, BH, dentists West Virginia Return-to-Home Scholarships In-state tuition Equal years rural practice Multiple disciplines Arkansas UAMS Programs Varies Rural service commitment Multiple disciplines Community Paramedicine/Mobile Integrated Health\nState Program Focus EMS Integration Texas Not explicit N/A N/A Ohio Mobile Integrated Health High-risk patient care, treat-in-place EMS protocol development West Virginia MIH/CP Care extension, treat-in-place Community college training Tennessee Community Paramedicine Transport alternative TBD North Carolina EMS Pipeline EMT training, community paramedicine Hub integration Funding Variation for Comparable Initiatives Telehealth Infrastructure Investment\nState Telehealth Allocation Rural Population Per-Capita Investment Texas $65-75M 4.7M $14-16 California $152M 2.7M $56 Arkansas ~$80M 1.3M $62 Wisconsin $205M + $85M 1.4M $207 Pattern observed: Wisconsin’s technology investment dramatically exceeds other states on a per-capita basis, reflecting the Rural Technology Transformation Fund and Rural Health Care Collaborative as centerpiece initiatives.\nCHW Program Investment\nState CHW Allocation FTE Target Cost per CHW Position Texas $9-12M 300 employed $30-40K California $8-12M 250-400 $30-40K Wisconsin $60M Pilot-based N/A (includes SPA development) Tennessee ~$8-10M 60-100 $80-100K (org accreditation) Pattern observed: Tennessee’s higher per-CHW cost reflects organizational accreditation approach rather than direct CHW support.

<p><em>Rural Health Transformation Project</em>
<em>Version 3: January 2026</em></p>
<h2 id="purpose">Purpose<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#purpose">#</a></h2>
<p>This technical document serves as a <strong>master reference documenting who receives RHTP funding</strong> across all 50 states. The document enables:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Cross-state comparison</strong> of intermediary structures and program types</li>
<li><strong>Identification of key organizations</strong> operating in the RHTP ecosystem</li>
<li><strong>Analysis of funding distribution patterns</strong> from state agencies to end recipients</li>
<li><strong>Tracking of implementation models</strong> across different state contexts</li>
</ol>
<p>Understanding where money flows reveals more about RHTP implementation than headline award figures. States channel billions through intermediary organizations, and these distribution decisions shape what transformation actually looks like on the ground.</p>

<h3 id="state-hospital-associations">State Hospital Associations<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#state-hospital-associations">#</a></h3>
<p>State hospital associations serve as <strong>primary intermediaries</strong> in most RHTP implementations, providing technical assistance to member hospitals, coordinating network formation, and advocating for policy alignment.</p>
