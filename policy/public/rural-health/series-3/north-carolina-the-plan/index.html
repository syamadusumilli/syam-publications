  "articleBody": "Orchestrating transformation through regional hubs while building on a national model for social care integration\nIntroduction Part 1 established North Carolina’s paradox: a state with the nation’s second largest rural population, fresh momentum from Medicaid expansion, and $213 million in RHTP funding now faces the simultaneous unraveling of the policy infrastructure that made expansion possible. The state acknowledges that RHTP replaces only 27% of projected rural hospital losses under H.R. 1. This is not a solution. It is a framework for triage.\nWhat distinguishes North Carolina’s approach is its explicit rejection of fragmented implementation in favor of regional coordination. The centerpiece is NC ROOTS, a network of six locally governed hubs designed to replace the patchwork of independent providers with coordinated regional systems. The acronym captures the aspiration: Rural Organizations Orchestrating Transformation for Sustainability.\nThe plan rests on a central premise: coordination generates efficiency that isolated providers cannot achieve. Rather than distributing funds directly to individual facilities, North Carolina bets that regional infrastructure can multiply the impact of limited dollars while building capacity that survives beyond 2030. Whether that bet pays off depends on implementation details still being finalized as funding arrives.\nThe Strategic Framework Governance Structure NCDHHS serves as lead agency with implementation responsibility distributed across divisions. The organizational architecture reflects North Carolina’s integrated approach to health transformation:\nStatewide Steering Committee\nNC Office of Rural Health (lead coordination) Division of Medicaid (managed care integration) Division of Public Health (prevention, chronic disease) Division of Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities, and Substance Use Services Implementation Partners\nNorth Carolina Community College System (workforce training) North Carolina Area Health Education Centers (graduate medical education) University partners (ECU, UNC, Duke, Wake Forest) Community Health Centers (primary care delivery) Rural Health Clinics (access points) Local Health Departments (public health infrastructure) This cross-divisional structure matters because North Carolina’s RHTP explicitly links clinical transformation to social care integration. The same administrative infrastructure that launched Medicaid expansion and the Healthy Opportunities Pilots now manages rural transformation. Institutional memory provides an advantage most states lack.\nTheory of Change North Carolina’s application articulates a systems-level theory of change: fragmented rural health delivery produces suboptimal outcomes regardless of funding levels. The problem is not merely insufficient resources but insufficient coordination among existing resources.\nThe logic flows as follows:\nRegional hubs create shared governance and coordination infrastructure Connected providers achieve efficiencies impossible in isolation Community voice shapes regional priorities rather than state mandates Sustainable models emerge from value-based payment transition Social determinants integration addresses root causes rather than symptoms This theory assumes that coordination costs are justified by coordination benefits, that local governance produces better decisions than state direction, and that five years provides sufficient time to build sustainable infrastructure. Part 3 will examine whether evidence supports these assumptions.\nCore Initiatives North Carolina organizes its RHTP around six interconnected initiatives, each addressing a distinct dimension of rural health transformation while contributing to the integrated system:\nInitiative Focus Connection to Hub Model Initiative 1 NC ROOTS Hub Establishment Foundation for all other initiatives Initiative 2 Primary Care, Prevention, Chronic Disease Clinical services coordinated through hubs Initiative 3 Behavioral Health and Substance Use Mental health integration via hubs Initiative 4 Workforce Development Training pipelines serving hub regions Initiative 5 Value-Based Payment Models Financial sustainability through hub contracting Initiative 6 Technology and Digital Health Infrastructure supporting hub coordination The Rural Health Innovation Fund (RHIF) operates across initiatives, providing technology access grants to rural providers participating in transformation activities.\nProgram Allocation Table Program Name Focus Area FY2026 Allocation (Est.) Lead Organization Key Deliverables NC ROOTS Hub Establishment Infrastructure/Coordination $45M NCDHHS Office of Rural Health 6 regional hubs operational by PY2 Expanded Primary Care Networks Access/Prevention $35M NC Community Health Center Association Maternal health, chronic disease programs Behavioral Health Integration Behavioral Health $30M NC Division of MH/DD/SUS SUD treatment, telehealth psychiatry Rural Workforce Initiative Workforce $32M NC AHEC New residencies, CHW training, EMT pipeline Value-Based Payment Transition Financial Sustainability $20M NC Division of Medicaid Rural provider VBP enrollment Rural Health Innovation Fund Technology $25M NC Office of Rural Health Provider technology grants Health Information Exchange Expansion Technology $15M NC HealthConnex HIE connectivity for rural providers Administration and Technical Assistance Program Support $11M NCDHHS Within 10% cap TOTAL $213M Note: Allocations are estimates based on application priorities and state communications. Final allocation percentages pending CMS cooperative agreement terms.\nInitiative 1: NC ROOTS Hubs Design and Mechanics NC ROOTS represents North Carolina’s signature innovation: six regional hubs serving as coordination infrastructure for all transformation activities. The acronym stands for Rural Organizations Orchestrating Transformation for Sustainability, signaling the state’s focus on building lasting capacity rather than temporary programs.\nHub Structure Each NC ROOTS Hub consists of:\nHub Lead: Organization responsible for regional coordination, contract management, and performance oversight Hub Network: Participating hospitals, primary care practices, behavioral health providers, EMS agencies, local health departments, and community-based organizations Community Advisory: Local voices shaping regional priorities and implementation Regional Alignment\nThe hubs align with North Carolina’s six Medicaid Standard Plan regions, creating consistency between managed care administration and transformation infrastructure:\nRegion Hub Coverage Major Population Centers Rural Characteristics Region 1 Western NC Asheville Appalachian mountains, tourism economy Region 2 Northwest Piedmont Winston-Salem, Greensboro Transition zone, manufacturing legacy Region 3 Southwest Piedmont Charlotte metro Metro-adjacent rural, growth pressure Region 4 North Central Durham, Raleigh metro Research Triangle influence, growth corridor Region 5 Sandhills/South Central Fayetteville Military presence, agricultural economy Region 6 Eastern NC Greenville, Wilmington Coastal plain, agricultural, highest poverty This alignment matters for Medicaid integration. Standard Plans already operate regional networks. NC ROOTS creates parallel infrastructure for rural transformation that can coordinate with managed care rather than competing with it.\nTarget Population and Geography NC ROOTS serves 85 of North Carolina’s 100 counties designated as rural under HRSA criteria. The state intentionally used the broadest federal definition to maximize eligibility: counties with at least one census tract classified as rural.\nThis expansive definition has consequences. Urban-adjacent counties in the Charlotte and Research Triangle regions qualify alongside deeply rural eastern North Carolina counties with fundamentally different challenges. The hub model must accommodate this diversity through regional flexibility rather than uniform statewide programs.\nEastern North Carolina (Region 6) faces the most severe challenges: highest poverty rates, most rural hospital closures, longest travel distances, and least provider availability. The Martin General Hospital closure in Williamston illustrates the stakes, with attempts to reopen as a Rural Emergency Hospital testing whether federal policy innovations can restore access after closure.\nFunding Allocation Initiative 1 receives approximately $45 million in FY2026 for hub establishment, representing roughly 21% of the state’s RHTP award. Funds support:\nHub Lead organization identification and contracting Network development and provider recruitment Governance infrastructure and staffing Technical assistance and capacity building Performance monitoring systems Subawardees Under Initiative 1 Hub Leads have not been formally announced as of January 2026, but the state application identifies categories of eligible organizations:\nPotential Hub Leads\nRegional health systems with rural service areas (e.g., Vidant/ECU Health in eastern NC) Hospital cooperatives or consortiums Regional health improvement collaboratives Multi-county local health department partnerships Hub Network Participants (Mandatory)\nCritical Access Hospitals within the region Community Health Centers and Federally Qualified Health Centers Rural Health Clinics Local Health Departments EMS agencies Community-based organizations The competitive Hub Lead selection process remains pending as the state finalizes the cooperative agreement with CMS. NCDHHS has indicated that Hub Leads will be responsible for subcontracting with network participants and managing regional fund flows.\nPerformance Metrics Metric Target Timeline Hubs established 6 By December 2027 (PY2) Eligible providers engaged Representative share per region PY2 Targeted local initiatives launched At least 1 per hub PY3 Successful community referrals tracked Baseline established PY5 Implementation Timeline Phase Activities Timeline Phase 1 Governance establishment, Hub Lead RFP development Q1-Q2 2026 Phase 2 Hub Lead selection, initial contracting Q3-Q4 2026 Phase 3 Network development, provider recruitment 2027 Phase 4 Full hub operations, initiative implementation 2028-2030 Phase 5 Sustainability planning, post-RHTP transition 2030-2031 Initiative 2: Primary Care, Prevention, and Chronic Disease Design and Mechanics Initiative 2 addresses North Carolina’s clinical service gaps through expanded primary care, maternal health services, chronic disease management, and nutrition programs. This initiative operationalizes the state’s commitment to addressing root causes of disease rather than solely treating consequences.\nCore Components\nPerinatal care expansion in counties with limited obstetric services Chronic disease management programs for diabetes, hypertension, heart disease Tobacco cessation through NC QuitLine expansion Nutrition infrastructure connecting food assistance to clinical care Physical activity programs delivered through community partners Target Population and Geography Priority populations include:\nPregnant women in rural counties lacking obstetric services Adults with multiple chronic conditions in high-burden regions Tobacco users in counties with highest smoking rates Food-insecure populations with nutrition-sensitive conditions Geographic prioritization follows health outcome disparities. Eastern and northeastern counties consistently rank worst on chronic disease prevalence and maternal mortality, receiving proportionally greater investment through regional hub allocation.\nFunding Allocation Initiative 2 receives approximately $35 million in FY2026, supporting:\nMaternal health service expansion in underserved counties Chronic disease program deployment through FQHC and RHC networks NC QuitLine capacity expansion for rural populations Food pharmacy and produce prescription programs Evidence-based physical activity program implementation Subawardees Under Initiative 2 Organization Role Estimated Allocation NC Community Health Center Association FQHC coordination, primary care expansion $12M NC Division of Public Health Chronic disease programs, tobacco cessation $8M Regional health systems with obstetric services Maternal health access points $8M Community food banks and partners Nutrition program delivery $4M NC QuitLine contractors Tobacco cessation expansion $3M Performance Metrics Metric Target Baseline First trimester prenatal care 80% of rural births 72% statewide Chronic disease self-management enrollment Increase by 25% To be established NC QuitLine rural engagement Increase by 30% Current rural participation Food pharmacy enrollments 5,000 participants 0 Initiative 3: Behavioral Health Integration Design and Mechanics Initiative 3 tackles North Carolina’s behavioral health crisis through expanded access to mental health services, substance use disorder treatment, and crisis intervention. The initiative builds on the state’s existing Tailored Plan infrastructure for high-acuity behavioral health populations while expanding services to the broader rural population.\nCore Components\nTelehealth psychiatry expansion to rural primary care settings SUD treatment capacity in regions with provider shortages Crisis response integration with emergency services Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic (CCBHC) model expansion School-based behavioral health in rural districts Target Population and Geography Behavioral health needs concentrate in specific regions:\nAppalachian western counties with highest opioid overdose rates Rural eastern counties with limited mental health provider access Counties without any psychiatric beds requiring long-distance transfers Adolescent populations in rural school systems lacking counselors Funding Allocation Initiative 3 receives approximately $30 million in FY2026, supporting:\nTelehealth psychiatry infrastructure and provider recruitment SUD treatment facility expansion and staffing Crisis intervention team training and equipment CCBHC establishment or expansion in underserved regions School-based mental health pilot programs Subawardees Under Initiative 3 Organization Role Estimated Allocation NC Division of MH/DD/SUS Program oversight, provider contracts $10M LME-MCOs (Alliance, Trillium, Partners, Vaya) Tailored Plan integration, network development $8M Academic medical centers Telehealth psychiatry hubs $6M CCBHCs (existing and developing) Comprehensive behavioral health services $4M Rural school districts School-based mental health pilots $2M Performance Metrics Metric Target Timeline Telehealth psychiatry access 50% of rural primary care practices PY3 SUD treatment capacity 20% increase in rural beds PY4 Crisis response availability 24/7 coverage in all hub regions PY3 School-based mental health 30 rural school pilot sites PY5 Initiative 4: Workforce Development Design and Mechanics Initiative 4 addresses North Carolina’s structural workforce deficit through expanded training pipelines, recruitment incentives, and retention support. The initiative explicitly recognizes that workforce shortages constrain every other RHTP objective.\nCore Components\nRural residency and fellowship expansion in high-need specialties Community Health Worker training and deployment through community college system EMS professional pipeline addressing rural ambulance staffing crisis High school to health career pathways in underserved communities Service commitment programs with retention incentives Community Health Worker Programs North Carolina has existing CHW infrastructure through the NC Community Health Worker Initiative, established through the Office of Rural Health. The RHTP expands this foundation:\nCHW Training Pipeline\nNC Community College System delivers Standardized Core Competency Training (SCCT) Nine-competency curriculum covers communication, advocacy, service coordination NC Community Health Worker Association (NCCHWA) provides certification NC AHEC offers specialty training modules CHW Deployment Strategy\nHub regions identify CHW placement priorities Primary care practices receive practice support for CHW integration Medicaid managed care contracts permit CHW care management participation Healthy Opportunities Pilots model informs reimbursement approaches Target Metrics\nTraining pipeline capacity increase by 200 CHWs annually Hub-based CHW coordinators in each region Integration with NCCARE360 referral platform EMS Workforce Rural EMS faces an acute staffing crisis across North Carolina:\nVolunteer services struggling to maintain 24/7 coverage Community paramedic programs limited by personnel availability Transfer distances requiring extended crew deployment The RHTP targets 150 new EMTs annually through community college training programs coordinated with hub regions.\nFunding Allocation Initiative 4 receives approximately $32 million in FY2026, supporting:\n8-12 new rural residency and fellowship programs CHW training expansion and deployment subsidies EMS training and recruitment incentives High school health career pathway programs Service commitment loan repayment and bonuses Subawardees Under Initiative 4 Organization Role Estimated Allocation NC AHEC Program Rural GME expansion, residency development $12M NC Community College System CHW and EMT training pipeline $8M Community Health Centers CHW employment and integration $5M Rural hospitals and health systems Residency training sites $4M High school career pathway programs Pipeline development $3M Performance Metrics Metric Target Timeline New rural GME programs 8-12 programs PY5 EMT training completions 150/year PY2-5 CHW certifications 200/year increase PY3-5 Primary care vacancy reduction 15% decrease PY5 Initiative 5: Value-Based Payment Models Design and Mechanics Initiative 5 supports rural provider transition to value-based payment through technical assistance, practice transformation support, and pilot payment models. The initiative recognizes that fee-for-service revenue instability threatens rural provider sustainability.\nCore Components\nPrimary care capitation pilots in rural settings Rural hospital alternative payment models focused on population health Practice transformation support for value-based care readiness Performance monitoring infrastructure for outcome measurement Payer coordination with Medicaid managed care plans Target Population and Geography Value-based payment transition prioritizes:\nRural primary care practices currently dependent on volume Critical Access Hospitals vulnerable to census fluctuations FQHCs and RHCs positioned for capitated models Provider networks within hub regions enabling risk pooling Funding Allocation Initiative 5 receives approximately $20 million in FY2026, supporting:\nPractice transformation technical assistance Payment model pilot implementation Performance measurement infrastructure Payer negotiation support Risk adjustment and data analytics capacity Implementation Approach North Carolina’s value-based payment transition builds on Medicaid managed care experience since 2021. The RHTP extends lessons learned to rural contexts:\nPractice Transformation: Rural providers receive tailored coaching on care management, quality measurement, and operational efficiency Pilot Payment Models: Voluntary capitation and shared savings arrangements test rural-appropriate incentives Hub-Based Risk Pooling: Regional hub structure enables smaller providers to participate through network arrangements Gradual Transition: Practices move from fee-for-service to hybrid to full value-based payment over multiple years Performance Metrics Metric Target Timeline Rural practices in VBP arrangements 30% of hub network PY4 Shared savings achieved Net positive in pilot markets PY5 Preventable hospitalization reduction 10% decrease in pilot populations PY5 Initiative 6: Technology and Digital Health Design and Mechanics Initiative 6 deploys technology infrastructure supporting rural transformation: expanded health information exchange, telehealth capacity, AI-powered clinical support, and digital literacy programs. The Rural Health Innovation Fund (RHIF) provides the funding mechanism.\nCore Components\nNC HealthConnex expansion connecting rural providers to statewide HIE Telehealth infrastructure grants for equipment and connectivity AI-powered clinical decision support appropriate for rural settings Digital literacy programs for providers and patients Broadband connectivity support in partnership with state broadband office Rural Health Innovation Fund (RHIF) The RHIF operates as a technology access grant program for rural providers participating in RHTP initiatives:\nEligible Uses\nTelehealth equipment (video conferencing, remote monitoring devices) EHR upgrades enabling HIE connectivity Cybersecurity improvements Digital literacy training AI clinical support tools Eligibility\nRural hospitals, CAHs, RHCs, FQHCs Primary care practices serving substantial Medicaid populations Behavioral health providers in underserved areas EMS agencies implementing community paramedicine Funding Allocation Initiative 6 receives approximately $25 million in FY2026 through the Rural Health Innovation Fund, plus $15 million for HIE expansion, totaling $40 million for technology infrastructure.\nSubawardees Under Initiative 6 Organization Role Estimated Allocation NC HealthConnex HIE expansion and connectivity $15M Rural provider direct grants (RHIF) Technology acquisition $20M NC Broadband Office (coordination) Connectivity planning $3M Digital literacy program providers Training delivery $2M Social Care Integration SDOH/HRSN Initiatives North Carolina’s RHTP explicitly embeds social care throughout clinical transformation initiatives. The state’s existing SDOH infrastructure provides a foundation unmatched by most other RHTP recipients.\nScreening Requirements\nNC ROOTS hubs must implement standardized SDOH screening Screening uses state-developed tool deployed through NCCARE360 Hub network providers required to screen enrolled populations HRSN Navigation\nHub-based navigation coordinators connect clinical referrals to community resources NCCARE360 enables closed-loop referral tracking Navigation integrates with Medicaid managed care requirements Integration with Clinical Initiatives\nInitiative 2 nutrition programs address food insecurity identified through screening Initiative 3 behavioral health services respond to social stressors Initiative 4 CHWs serve as navigation link between clinical and social services Healthy Opportunities Pilots Foundation North Carolina’s Healthy Opportunities Pilots (HOP) represent the nation’s first comprehensive Medicaid program paying for non-medical interventions. Launched in 2022 across three regions covering 33 counties, HOP provides a model for RHTP social care integration.\nHOP Services Funded\nHousing support (security deposits, safety modifications, utility assistance) Food delivery and produce prescriptions Transportation to medical appointments Interpersonal violence and toxic stress interventions HOP Infrastructure\nThree Network Leads coordinating human service organizations Over 30,000 Medicaid members enrolled $107 million+ delivered to community organizations Interim evaluation showing $85 monthly savings per participant HOP Status As of January 2026, HOP faces funding uncertainty. The 2025-2027 biennial state budget negotiations left no funding scheduled for HOP service delivery starting July 2025. The state hopes this represents a pause rather than termination.\nThe RHTP explicitly proposes to build on HOP model elements through hub-based nutrition and social care programming, even as the Medicaid-funded pilot faces discontinuation.\nCommunity Health Worker Programs CHW deployment under RHTP coordinates with established state infrastructure:\nExisting CHW Programs\nOver 400 CHWs deployed statewide during COVID response Standardized certification through NCCHWA Integration with Advanced Medical Homes permitted under Medicaid contracts Healthy Opportunities Pilots utilize CHWs for care management RHTP CHW Strategy\nHub regions identify CHW priority deployment areas Training pipeline expansion through community college system Hub-based CHW coordination and supervision NCCARE360 integration for resource connection Funding Allocation for CHWs Approximately $5-7 million annually embedded within Initiative 4 workforce programs and Initiative 1 hub operations.\nCommunity Information Exchange and Referral Platforms NCCARE360 provides North Carolina’s statewide coordinated care network, a platform enabling electronic referrals between healthcare and human services with closed-loop tracking.\nPlatform Capabilities\nElectronic referral transmission between providers and CBOs Secure client information sharing Outcome tracking for referral completion Statewide resource directory RHTP Integration\nHub network providers required to connect to NCCARE360 SDOH screening results flow to referral platform Community organizations in hub regions registered in directory Outcome data supports population health monitoring Platform Operator NCCARE360 operates through Foundation for Health Leadership and Innovation in partnership with Unite Us technology platform.

The NC ROOTS structure creates forced integration across otherwise siloed initiatives:\nHub as Integration Mechanism\nClinical services (Initiatives 2, 3) delivered through hub network providers Workforce (Initiative 4) trained and deployed within hub regions Payment transformation (Initiative 5) tested within hub populations Technology (Initiative 6) connected through hub infrastructure Shared Infrastructure\nNCCARE360 serves all initiatives requiring referral and resource connection NC HealthConnex provides clinical data backbone Hub governance oversees cross-initiative coordination Performance monitoring aggregates across initiative-specific metrics Sequencing Dependencies\nInitiative 1 (hub establishment) must precede full implementation of Initiatives 2-5 Initiative 6 (technology) provides infrastructure for all other initiatives Initiative 4 (workforce) constrains Initiative 2 and 3 service expansion Integration Challenges\nHub selection delays cascade to all downstream activities Provider recruitment varies by region, creating uneven implementation Social care components depend on CBO capacity that varies regionally Value-based payment transition requires provider buy-in not yet secured Stakeholder Architecture Lead Agency NCDHHS Office of Rural Health serves as primary coordination point, with cross-divisional accountability:\nDivision of Medicaid: Payment model integration, managed care coordination Division of Public Health: Prevention programs, chronic disease Division of MH/DD/SUS: Behavioral health, substance use services Academic Partners NC AHEC Program provides statewide infrastructure for workforce development:\nNine regional AHEC centers covering all hub regions Established relationships with community colleges and health systems Practice support coaches for CHW integration GME expansion coordination University Medical Centers contribute specialty access and training:\nECU/Vidant (now ECU Health): Eastern NC hub anchor UNC Health: Statewide reach, telehealth infrastructure Atrium/Wake Forest: Western Piedmont presence Duke: Research Triangle, specialty consultation Provider Organizations NC Community Health Center Association coordinates FQHC network:\n43 Community Health Centers operating 200+ sites Primary care backbone for many rural communities PCMH certification and quality improvement infrastructure NC Hospital Association represents rural hospital interests:\nAdvocacy for RHTP maximization Technical assistance coordination Convening capacity across membership Community Organizations Human Service Organizations deliver social care interventions:\nFood banks and pantries Housing organizations Transportation providers Domestic violence services Faith-based Organizations provide community trust and reach:\nRural congregations as health access points Pastoral care integration with formal services Volunteer mobilization Tribal Partners Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians operates distinct health infrastructure:\nCherokee Indian Hospital Authority EBCI Tribal Option for Medicaid services Integration requirements with state RHTP activities Budget Flow and Timeline Allocation Across Initiatives Initiative FY2026 Allocation % of Total Cumulative Five-Year (Est.)

Administrative funds support:\nNCDHHS program management staff Technical assistance contracts Performance monitoring systems Stakeholder engagement activities Reporting and compliance Two-Year Obligation Requirement FY2026 funds must be obligated by September 30, 2027. The hub-based structure creates obligation risk:\nHub Lead contracting must complete before major subawards Provider recruitment timelines vary by region CBO capacity building requires lead time Technology procurement follows competitive processes North Carolina’s first-year strategy focuses on expanding existing programs while hub infrastructure develops, reducing obligation risk.\nPerformance Monitoring Metrics by Initiative (see individual sections above)\nCross-Initiative Indicators\nHub network participation rates Regional health outcome trends NCCARE360 referral and completion rates Medicaid managed care quality measures Reporting Requirements\nQuarterly progress reports to CMS Annual outcome assessments Stakeholder feedback documentation Mid-program evaluation at year 3 What the Plan Assumes Explicit Assumptions North Carolina’s application explicitly assumes:\nCMS approves cooperative agreement terms as proposed Hub Lead organizations can be identified and contracted within 6-9 months Providers will participate in hub networks voluntarily Existing infrastructure (NCCARE360, AHEC, community colleges) can scale Value-based payment models can generate sustainable revenue Technology investments produce efficiency gains justifying costs Implicit Assumptions The plan implicitly assumes:\nMedicaid expansion survives: The entire social care integration model depends on coverage levels enabled by expansion. H.R. 1 implementation could unravel this foundation. Federal partnership continues: CMS cooperative agreement terms assume ongoing technical assistance and flexibility. Administration priorities could shift. Provider capacity exists: Hub network participation requires providers with margin to invest in transformation activities. Financially distressed facilities may lack capacity. Community organizations can deliver: Social care components depend on CBO capacity that varies dramatically by region. Five years is sufficient: Building sustainable infrastructure while simultaneously delivering services requires timeline discipline that rarely materializes. Dependencies on External Factors Federal Policy Stability\nMedicaid coverage levels under H.R. 1 implementation CMS cooperative agreement flexibility Future RHTP reauthorization beyond 2030 State Policy Continuity\nBiennial budget support for matched programs Healthy Opportunities Pilots restoration Medicaid managed care contract requirements Economic Conditions\nRural hospital financial viability CBO operational sustainability Healthcare workforce labor market Risks Acknowledged The application acknowledges:\nRHTP replaces only ~27% of rural hospital losses under H.R. 1 Implementation timelines are aggressive Regional variation requires flexible approaches Sustainability beyond 2030 requires payment transformation success Risks Ignored The application does not address:\nWhat happens if Medicaid expansion unravels How hub model performs if major regional provider fails Whether VBP transition can succeed in five years What social care elements survive if HOP funding is not restored Conclusion North Carolina proposes a fundamentally different approach to RHTP implementation. Rather than distributing funds to individual providers or funding discrete programs, the state bets on regional coordination infrastructure that forces integration across clinical, workforce, behavioral health, and social care activities.\nThe NC ROOTS model has genuine promise. Coordination can generate efficiencies, local governance can improve decision-making, and integrated systems can address root causes rather than symptoms. North Carolina’s existing infrastructure, including NCCARE360, the CHW certification system, and Healthy Opportunities experience, provides advantages most states lack.\nBut the plan also carries substantial risks. Hub establishment timelines are aggressive. Provider participation is voluntary. Social care components depend on CBO capacity that varies by region. And the entire framework rests on Medicaid coverage levels that H.R. 1 threatens to erode.\nPart 3 will assess whether the plan’s assumptions hold, which components survive partial funding, and whether North Carolina’s coordination bet produces sustainable transformation or merely redistributes inadequate resources through a more complex administrative structure.\nCross-References Series 1: Rural America\n1.A: Geography and Definition (North Carolina regional context) 1.C: Education and Literacy (workforce pipeline context) 1.D: Economics and Employment (rural economic challenges) 1.E: Healthcare Access (baseline infrastructure) Series 2: Federal Policy Architecture\n2.A: RHTP Structure and Rules (statutory framework) 2.B: Medicaid Architecture (expansion state implications) 2.H: The 2030 Cliff (sustainability analysis) Series 3: State Implementation\n3.NC.1: North Carolina, The Problem (baseline crisis) 3.NC.3: North Carolina, The Analysis (forthcoming) Series 4: Transformation Approaches\n4.D: Community Health Workers (CHW deployment models) 4.H: Social Needs Integration (SDOH/HRSN approaches) Sources Blythe, Anne, and Lola Oliverio. “During the Pandemic, Community Health Care Workers Provided a Bridge to Care for Marginalized Populations.

<p><em>Orchestrating transformation through regional hubs while building on a national model for social care integration</em></p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#introduction">#</a></h2>
<p>Part 1 established North Carolina&rsquo;s paradox: a state with the nation&rsquo;s second largest rural population, fresh momentum from Medicaid expansion, and $213 million in RHTP funding now faces the simultaneous unraveling of the policy infrastructure that made expansion possible. The state acknowledges that <strong>RHTP replaces only 27% of projected rural hospital losses</strong> under H.R. 1. This is not a solution. It is a framework for triage.</p>
<p>What distinguishes North Carolina&rsquo;s approach is its <strong>explicit rejection of fragmented implementation</strong> in favor of regional coordination. The centerpiece is <strong>NC ROOTS</strong>, a network of six locally governed hubs designed to replace the patchwork of independent providers with coordinated regional systems. The acronym captures the aspiration: <strong>Rural Organizations Orchestrating Transformation for Sustainability</strong>.</p>
<p>The plan rests on a central premise: <strong>coordination generates efficiency that isolated providers cannot achieve</strong>. Rather than distributing funds directly to individual facilities, North Carolina bets that regional infrastructure can multiply the impact of limited dollars while building capacity that survives beyond 2030. Whether that bet pays off depends on implementation details still being finalized as funding arrives.</p>
<h2 id="the-strategic-framework">The Strategic Framework<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-strategic-framework">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="governance-structure">Governance Structure<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#governance-structure">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>NCDHHS serves as lead agency</strong> with implementation responsibility distributed across divisions. The organizational architecture reflects North Carolina&rsquo;s integrated approach to health transformation:</p>
<p><strong>Statewide Steering Committee</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>NC Office of Rural Health (lead coordination)</li>
<li>Division of Medicaid (managed care integration)</li>
<li>Division of Public Health (prevention, chronic disease)</li>
<li>Division of Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities, and Substance Use Services</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Implementation Partners</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>North Carolina Community College System (workforce training)</li>
<li>North Carolina Area Health Education Centers (graduate medical education)</li>
<li>University partners (ECU, UNC, Duke, Wake Forest)</li>
<li>Community Health Centers (primary care delivery)</li>
<li>Rural Health Clinics (access points)</li>
<li>Local Health Departments (public health infrastructure)</li>
</ul>
<p>This <strong>cross-divisional structure</strong> matters because North Carolina&rsquo;s RHTP explicitly links clinical transformation to social care integration. The same administrative infrastructure that launched Medicaid expansion and the Healthy Opportunities Pilots now manages rural transformation. Institutional memory provides an advantage most states lack.</p>
<h3 id="theory-of-change">Theory of Change<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#theory-of-change">#</a></h3>
<p>North Carolina&rsquo;s application articulates a <strong>systems-level theory of change</strong>: fragmented rural health delivery produces suboptimal outcomes regardless of funding levels. The problem is not merely insufficient resources but <strong>insufficient coordination</strong> among existing resources.</p>
<p>The logic flows as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Regional hubs</strong> create shared governance and coordination infrastructure</li>
<li><strong>Connected providers</strong> achieve efficiencies impossible in isolation</li>
<li><strong>Community voice</strong> shapes regional priorities rather than state mandates</li>
<li><strong>Sustainable models</strong> emerge from value-based payment transition</li>
<li><strong>Social determinants</strong> integration addresses root causes rather than symptoms</li>
</ol>
<p>This theory assumes that coordination costs are justified by coordination benefits, that local governance produces better decisions than state direction, and that five years provides sufficient time to build sustainable infrastructure. Part 3 will examine whether evidence supports these assumptions.</p>
<h3 id="core-initiatives">Core Initiatives<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#core-initiatives">#</a></h3>
<p>North Carolina organizes its RHTP around <strong>six interconnected initiatives</strong>, each addressing a distinct dimension of rural health transformation while contributing to the integrated system:</p>

<p>NC ROOTS represents North Carolina&rsquo;s <strong>signature innovation</strong>: six regional hubs serving as coordination infrastructure for all transformation activities. The acronym stands for <strong>Rural Organizations Orchestrating Transformation for Sustainability</strong>, signaling the state&rsquo;s focus on building lasting capacity rather than temporary programs.</p>
<p><strong>Hub Structure</strong>
Each NC ROOTS Hub consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hub Lead</strong>: Organization responsible for regional coordination, contract management, and performance oversight</li>
<li><strong>Hub Network</strong>: Participating hospitals, primary care practices, behavioral health providers, EMS agencies, local health departments, and community-based organizations</li>
<li><strong>Community Advisory</strong>: Local voices shaping regional priorities and implementation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Regional Alignment</strong></p>
<p>The hubs align with North Carolina&rsquo;s <strong>six Medicaid Standard Plan regions</strong>, creating consistency between managed care administration and transformation infrastructure:</p>

<p>This alignment matters for <strong>Medicaid integration</strong>. Standard Plans already operate regional networks. NC ROOTS creates parallel infrastructure for rural transformation that can coordinate with managed care rather than competing with it.</p>
<h3 id="target-population-and-geography">Target Population and Geography<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#target-population-and-geography">#</a></h3>
<p>NC ROOTS serves <strong>85 of North Carolina&rsquo;s 100 counties</strong> designated as rural under HRSA criteria. The state intentionally used the <strong>broadest federal definition</strong> to maximize eligibility: counties with at least one census tract classified as rural.</p>
<p>This expansive definition has consequences. Urban-adjacent counties in the Charlotte and Research Triangle regions qualify alongside deeply rural eastern North Carolina counties with fundamentally different challenges. The hub model must accommodate this diversity through regional flexibility rather than uniform statewide programs.</p>
<p><strong>Eastern North Carolina</strong> (Region 6) faces the most severe challenges: highest poverty rates, most rural hospital closures, longest travel distances, and least provider availability. The Martin General Hospital closure in Williamston illustrates the stakes, with attempts to reopen as a Rural Emergency Hospital testing whether federal policy innovations can restore access after closure.</p>
<h3 id="funding-allocation">Funding Allocation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#funding-allocation">#</a></h3>
<p>Initiative 1 receives approximately <strong>$45 million in FY2026</strong> for hub establishment, representing roughly 21% of the state&rsquo;s RHTP award. Funds support:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hub Lead organization identification and contracting</li>
<li>Network development and provider recruitment</li>
<li>Governance infrastructure and staffing</li>
<li>Technical assistance and capacity building</li>
<li>Performance monitoring systems</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="subawardees-under-initiative-1">Subawardees Under Initiative 1<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#subawardees-under-initiative-1">#</a></h3>
<p>Hub Leads have not been formally announced as of January 2026, but the state application identifies categories of eligible organizations:</p>
<p><strong>Potential Hub Leads</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Regional health systems with rural service areas (e.g., Vidant/ECU Health in eastern NC)</li>
<li>Hospital cooperatives or consortiums</li>
<li>Regional health improvement collaboratives</li>
<li>Multi-county local health department partnerships</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hub Network Participants (Mandatory)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Critical Access Hospitals within the region</li>
<li>Community Health Centers and Federally Qualified Health Centers</li>
<li>Rural Health Clinics</li>
<li>Local Health Departments</li>
<li>EMS agencies</li>
<li>Community-based organizations</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>competitive Hub Lead selection process</strong> remains pending as the state finalizes the cooperative agreement with CMS. NCDHHS has indicated that Hub Leads will be responsible for subcontracting with network participants and managing regional fund flows.</p>

<p>Initiative 2 addresses North Carolina&rsquo;s <strong>clinical service gaps</strong> through expanded primary care, maternal health services, chronic disease management, and nutrition programs. This initiative operationalizes the state&rsquo;s commitment to <strong>addressing root causes of disease</strong> rather than solely treating consequences.</p>
<p><strong>Core Components</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perinatal care expansion</strong> in counties with limited obstetric services</li>
<li><strong>Chronic disease management</strong> programs for diabetes, hypertension, heart disease</li>
<li><strong>Tobacco cessation</strong> through NC QuitLine expansion</li>
<li><strong>Nutrition infrastructure</strong> connecting food assistance to clinical care</li>
<li><strong>Physical activity programs</strong> delivered through community partners</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="target-population-and-geography-1">Target Population and Geography<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#target-population-and-geography-1">#</a></h3>
<p>Priority populations include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pregnant women in rural counties</strong> lacking obstetric services</li>
<li><strong>Adults with multiple chronic conditions</strong> in high-burden regions</li>
<li><strong>Tobacco users</strong> in counties with highest smoking rates</li>
<li><strong>Food-insecure populations</strong> with nutrition-sensitive conditions</li>
</ul>
<p>Geographic prioritization follows health outcome disparities. <strong>Eastern and northeastern counties</strong> consistently rank worst on chronic disease prevalence and maternal mortality, receiving proportionally greater investment through regional hub allocation.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>North Carolina proposes a <strong>fundamentally different approach</strong> to RHTP implementation. Rather than distributing funds to individual providers or funding discrete programs, the state bets on <strong>regional coordination infrastructure</strong> that forces integration across clinical, workforce, behavioral health, and social care activities.</p>
<p>The NC ROOTS model has genuine promise. Coordination can generate efficiencies, local governance can improve decision-making, and integrated systems can address root causes rather than symptoms. North Carolina&rsquo;s existing infrastructure, including NCCARE360, the CHW certification system, and Healthy Opportunities experience, provides advantages most states lack.</p>
<p>But the plan also carries substantial risks. Hub establishment timelines are aggressive. Provider participation is voluntary. Social care components depend on CBO capacity that varies by region. And the entire framework rests on Medicaid coverage levels that H.R. 1 threatens to erode.</p>
<p>Part 3 will assess whether the plan&rsquo;s assumptions hold, which components survive partial funding, and whether North Carolina&rsquo;s coordination bet produces sustainable transformation or merely redistributes inadequate resources through a more complex administrative structure.</p>
