  "articleBody": "Part 1 established the baseline: $223.5 million for 1.47 million rural Oklahomans translates to approximately $152 per person annually, placing Oklahoma in the upper tier of per capita allocations. Forty-nine out of fifty in health system performance. Sixty-four percent of rural hospitals at risk. The worst breast cancer mortality in the nation. These are the conditions the Oklahoma State Department of Health must transform with resources that, while favorable by national comparison, remain modest against the scale of dysfunction.\nOklahoma responded with a six-initiative strategy organizing transformation around tribal health integration, technology deployment, workforce development, and regional collaboration. The application leveraged what no other state possesses: 39 federally recognized tribes operating extensive health systems that serve both tribal citizens and, through various coordination arrangements, broader rural populations.\nThe central premise: Oklahoma’s unique tribal health infrastructure creates integration opportunities that can accelerate transformation beyond what standalone state efforts achieve. Tribal systems bring workforce, facilities, community trust, and operational capacity that decades of state investment failed to build. RHTP funding can catalyze coordination rather than construct infrastructure from scratch.\nWhether this premise holds will determine if Oklahoma’s favorable funding position translates to improved outcomes or merely well-documented activity.\nGovernance Structure Lead Agency and Implementation Partners The Oklahoma State Department of Health (OSDH) serves as lead agency and cooperative agreement holder. Commissioner Heather Maughan bears ultimate responsibility for program implementation, reporting, and compliance with CMS requirements.\nImplementation involves multi-agency coordination reflecting the reality that rural health transformation touches domains beyond OSDH’s direct authority:\nAgency Function Oklahoma Health Care Authority (OHCA) Medicaid integration, value-based care transition, SoonerSelect alignment Department of Human Services (DHS) Social service coordination, transportation, community support Oklahoma Workforce Commission Training programs, recruitment initiatives Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services (DMH) Behavioral health integration, CCBHC expansion Office of Broadband Technology Digital infrastructure supporting telehealth expansion The governance structure intentionally positions OSDH as coordinator rather than sole implementer. Rural health transformation requires Medicaid payment systems, behavioral health capacity, workforce training, and technology infrastructure that no single agency controls. OSDH must align agencies with different statutory missions, budget processes, and political leadership.\nTribal Consultation and Coordination Oklahoma’s application emerged from genuine tribal consultation with more than 60 tribal representatives participating in planning discussions. This consultation was not performative compliance with federal requirements. Tribal health systems in Oklahoma operate at scale sufficient to influence program design, and tribal representatives possessed technical expertise and operational knowledge that shaped initiative structure.\nThe coordination structure creates joint planning mechanisms:\nJoint planning committees including tribal and state health officials Service coordination protocols defining referral pathways between systems Data sharing agreements bridging IHS, tribal, and state health information systems Workforce development partnerships serving both tribal and general rural populations Cultural competency requirements ensuring program design reflects tribal input The practical challenge: tribal nations are sovereign governments, not state agencies or contractors. Coordination requires government-to-government relationships with 39 distinct tribal governments, each with its own priorities, capacity, and relationships with federal agencies. OSDH cannot direct tribal participation; it can only create frameworks that make participation beneficial for tribal health systems.\nStrategic Framework Theory of Change Oklahoma’s theory of change assumes that bringing care closer to home through technology, transportation, and workforce development will improve outcomes while regional collaboration and value-based payment create sustainability. The state explicitly designed initiatives with post-2030 funding sources in mind: billable services, provider-assumed costs, ongoing government funding, private funding, and one-time capital investments that yield durable infrastructure.\nThe logic model:\nTribal integration accelerates transformation. Tribal health systems provide workforce, facilities, and community relationships that decades of state effort failed to build. RHTP catalyzes coordination rather than constructing parallel infrastructure.\nTechnology extends capacity faster than workforce alone. Telehealth, remote monitoring, and AI-assisted triage expand provider reach while workforce pipelines produce additional practitioners over longer horizons.\nRegional collaboration achieves economies unavailable to isolated facilities. Shared purchasing, coordinated staffing, and referral networks improve efficiency for facilities that cannot achieve scale individually.\nValue-based payment creates sustainability incentives. Transition from fee-for-service to outcomes-based reimbursement aligns provider incentives with population health improvement.\nUpstream prevention reduces chronic disease burden. Investment in wellness programming, chronic disease management, and behavioral health integration addresses Oklahoma’s leading causes of poor outcomes.\nTheory Vulnerabilities The theory assumes tribal health systems will coordinate with state programs despite historical tensions between tribal governments and state authority. It assumes technology deployment reaches populations with connectivity, which remains incomplete in significant portions of rural Oklahoma. It assumes workforce pipelines produce practitioners who stay in Oklahoma rather than migrating to higher-paying markets. Each assumption could fail.\nSix RHTP Initiatives Oklahoma organizes transformation around six interconnected initiatives addressing access, prevention, workforce, collaboration, payment reform, and technology infrastructure.\nInitiative 1: Innovating the Care Model Focus: Telehealth expansion, transportation support, expanded care teams, local infrastructure investment.\nThis initiative directly addresses access barriers by bringing services to communities rather than requiring travel. Mobile wellness units deliver preventive services in communities lacking fixed facilities. Virtual specialist consultations connect rural patients with cardiology, dermatology, psychiatry, and other specialties that rural communities cannot support through permanent staffing. Ride scheduling tools and local driver programs address transportation as the barrier it actually is for populations without reliable vehicles.\nKey components:\nMobile wellness units serving isolated communities Telehealth platform deployment across rural facilities Virtual specialist consultation networks Transportation coordination and ride scheduling Expanded care team models integrating CHWs, pharmacists, and behavioral health Implementation timeline: Mobile units and telehealth platforms deploy Year 1. Specialist consultation networks establish Year 2. Full expansion through Year 5.\nInitiative 2: Moving Upstream Focus: Chronic disease prevention and management, community-led wellness programs.\nOklahoma’s burden of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease demands upstream intervention. The state’s five leading health improvement priorities all involve chronic conditions that prevention and management programs can address. Programs emphasize physical fitness, nutrition, and evidence-based chronic disease management aligned with Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) priorities.\nKey components:\nDiabetes Prevention Program expansion Community fitness and wellness programming Nutrition education and food access initiatives Chronic disease self-management support School and workplace wellness integration MAHA alignment: Initiative 2 explicitly brands around federal wellness priorities, positioning Oklahoma for favorable scoring in annual re-evaluation. Lifestyle intervention emphasis matches administration priorities while addressing Oklahoma’s genuine chronic disease burden.\nInitiative 3: Growing the Next Generation of Rural Talent Focus: “Grow your own” workforce initiatives, training placements, recruitment and retention programs.\nBuilding on models like the OSU-COM Cherokee Nation Campus that demonstrates 70% in-state residency placement, Oklahoma aims to train local students who will practice locally. Pipeline development spans community health workers through physicians, recognizing that different workforce categories have different training timelines and retention dynamics.\nKey components:\nCHW training and certification expansion Clinical training placements in rural and tribal settings Loan repayment and scholarship programs Recruitment partnerships with training institutions Retention support for practicing rural providers Timeline reality: Physician training produces practitioners in 2032 at earliest. Nurse practitioner and PA programs take three to four years. CHW training produces workers within twelve to eighteen months. Initiative 3 front-loads CHW deployment while building longer-term pipelines.\nInitiative 4: Facilitating Regional Collaboration Focus: Shared operations, technology, coordinated care across providers.\nRural facilities working together on purchasing, staffing, and service coordination can achieve efficiencies that isolated operations cannot. Regional networks create referral pathways and specialist access while reducing duplication of administrative functions.\nKey components:\nRegional health network development Shared purchasing and supply chain coordination Coordinated staffing pools for coverage Referral pathway formalization Administrative service consolidation Tribal integration point: Regional collaboration necessarily involves tribal facilities that serve as primary care sources in many rural areas. Network development must bridge tribal and non-tribal systems rather than creating parallel coordination structures.\nInitiative 5: Shifting to Value Focus: Technical assistance for value-based care transition, infrastructure development, quality incentive programs.\nOklahoma’s SoonerSelect managed care transition in 2024 created foundation for value-based payment. RHTP accelerates rural provider readiness for outcomes-based reimbursement rather than building from scratch. Technical assistance helps rural providers understand quality reporting requirements, manage population health data, and demonstrate outcomes that generate value-based payment.\nKey components:\nValue-based care technical assistance Quality reporting infrastructure Population health management tools Performance incentive program design Managed care organization coordination SoonerSelect alignment: The $700 million in directed payments flowing through SoonerSelect creates financial stakes for value-based performance. RHTP investment positions rural providers to succeed under payment models that will persist beyond federal funding.\nInitiative 6: Building Health Data Utility Focus: EHR upgrades, interoperability, data sharing, analytics platforms.\nConnected health records reduce duplicate testing, improve care coordination, and enable population health management. This digital backbone underlies all other initiatives. Providers cannot coordinate care without shared information. Quality cannot be measured without data infrastructure. Value-based payment requires outcomes tracking that fragmented systems cannot support.\nKey components:\nEHR upgrade and standardization support Health information exchange enhancement Interoperability across tribal and non-tribal systems Analytics platforms for population health management Patient data access and portal integration IHS PATH alignment: The federal IHS PATH EHR modernization pilots at Lawton Indian Hospital in 2026. Aligning RHTP health data utility investments with PATH implementation could accelerate interoperability across the tribal/non-tribal divide, creating connected systems that neither federal nor state investment could achieve independently.\nProgram and Funding Distribution Estimated Initiative Allocations Initiative FY2026 Allocation (Est.) Primary Focus Key Programs Innovating the Care Model $55-65M Access expansion Telehealth infrastructure, mobile units, transportation Moving Upstream $25-35M Prevention and wellness Chronic disease management, community wellness Growing Next-Gen Talent $35-45M Workforce development Training programs, loan repayment, recruitment Regional Collaboration $30-40M System coordination Shared services, network development Shifting to Value $20-30M Payment transformation Technical assistance, quality infrastructure Health Data Utility $25-35M Technology backbone EHR, interoperability, analytics Administration $10-15M Program oversight Coordination, compliance, evaluation Allocations estimated from application framework; final budget allocations under CMS cooperative agreement may vary.\nTribal Health Integration Oklahoma’s RHTP represents the most significant tribal health integration opportunity in the program nationally. Coordination with 39 tribes and extensive IHS/tribal facility infrastructure creates pathways unavailable elsewhere:\nJoint planning: Tribal consultation with more than 60 representatives shaped application design, not merely validated state-developed plans.\nService coordination: Referral networks connecting tribal and non-tribal facilities create care pathways that leverage tribal capacity for populations served by both systems.\nWorkforce sharing: Training programs serving both tribal and general rural populations avoid duplication while building workforce serving multiple systems.\nTechnology alignment: Data sharing infrastructure bridging IHS and state systems enables care coordination that fragmented systems prevent.\nCultural competency: Programs designed with tribal input ensure appropriate care delivery for populations with distinct health beliefs and practices.\nKey Subawardees Organization Type Estimated Recipients Funding Role Critical Access Hospitals 30-38 facilities Infrastructure, telehealth, workforce Regional health systems 5-8 systems Network coordination, specialist access FQHCs (rural sites) 25-40 sites Primary care expansion, behavioral health Tribal health facilities Multiple Care coordination, technology, workforce University partners 2-4 institutions Training programs, telehealth, research Community-based organizations 50+ Transportation, social services, outreach Funding Flow Structure CMS Award ($223.5M)\râ†“\rOklahoma State Department of Health (Lead Agency)\râ†“\râ”œâ”€â”€ Oklahoma Health Care Authority\râ”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ Value-based care infrastructure\râ”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ SoonerSelect alignment programs\râ”‚ â””â”€â”€ Quality incentive programs\râ”‚\râ”œâ”€â”€ Department of Mental Health\râ”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ Behavioral health integration\râ”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ CCBHC expansion\râ”‚ â””â”€â”€ Substance use programs\râ”‚\râ”œâ”€â”€ Regional Health Networks\râ”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ Hospital coordination\râ”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ Shared services\râ”‚ â””â”€â”€ Referral systems\râ”‚\râ”œâ”€â”€ Workforce Development\râ”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ Training programs (via university partners)\râ”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ Loan repayment expansion\râ”‚ â””â”€â”€ CHW certification/deployment\râ”‚\râ”œâ”€â”€ Technology Infrastructure\râ”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ EHR upgrades (direct to providers)\râ”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ Interoperability platforms\râ”‚ â””â”€â”€ Telehealth equipment\râ”‚\râ””â”€â”€ Administrative (RHTP Program Office) Social Care Integration SDOH/HRSN Framework Oklahoma’s RHTP addresses social determinants through multiple channels, though funding levels vary by component:\nComponent Included in Plan Estimated Funding Implementation Approach Likely Funded?

The state’s mobile wellness units bring care to communities rather than requiring travel. These approaches acknowledge that technology solutions alone cannot serve populations lacking vehicles and internet access.\nCommunity Health Worker Expansion OSDH maintains CHW licensing and certification infrastructure that RHTP can scale. Training programs, supervision structures, and reimbursement pathways exist; funding accelerates deployment. The tribal health system’s extensive use of community health representatives provides models for non-tribal adaptation.\nCHW expansion components:\nTraining program capacity increase Certification pathway streamlining Supervision infrastructure support Reimbursement advocacy with managed care organizations Deployment in highest-need communities CHWs produce within twelve to eighteen months of training initiation. Unlike physician pipelines requiring decade-long investment, CHW programs yield workers within RHTP’s window who can then contribute to transformation during the program period.\nCritical Implementation Questions Explicit Assumptions Oklahoma’s plan explicitly assumes:\nTribal health systems will coordinate genuinely. Integration requires 39 sovereign governments choosing to participate in frameworks Oklahoma designs. Tribal governments have their own priorities, capacities, and relationships with federal agencies.\nTechnology reaches underserved populations. Telehealth and data infrastructure serve communities with connectivity. Significant portions of rural Oklahoma lack broadband meeting minimum federal standards.\nValue-based payment produces sustainability. Transition from fee-for-service to outcomes-based reimbursement creates incentives that persist beyond federal funding.\nWorkforce pipelines retain graduates in Oklahoma. Training programs produce practitioners who stay rather than migrating to higher-paying markets in Dallas, Houston, or Kansas City.\nImplicit Assumptions The plan implicitly assumes:\nMedicaid cuts do not overwhelm transformation investment. Projected $8.7 billion in Medicaid losses over the decade could offset RHTP’s $1.12 billion five-year investment.\nHospital closure trajectory stabilizes. Twenty-two facilities at immediate closure risk cannot all survive through transformation investment that RHTP prohibits from direct operating support.\nMental health treatment gaps prove addressable. Eighty to ninety-five percent untreated rates may reflect capacity constraints that workforce development cannot resolve within program timelines.\nConstitutional Medicaid protection provides sufficient stability. Federal cuts may erode coverage despite state constitutional protection of expansion.\nDependencies on External Factors Factor Dependency Level Risk Tribal government participation High Sovereignty limits Oklahoma’s ability to require coordination Broadband buildout High Technology initiatives fail without connectivity Medicaid cut magnitude High Large cuts offset transformation investment IHS PATH implementation Moderate Delayed PATH limits interoperability opportunity State budget Moderate Matching or sustainability funding uncertain Conclusion Oklahoma proposes to transform rural healthcare for 1.47 million residents through six interconnected initiatives leveraging what no other state possesses: 39 federally recognized tribes operating extensive health systems that can coordinate with state transformation efforts.\nThe plan is rational within its constraints. Tribal integration offers genuine acceleration opportunity. Technology extends capacity while workforce pipelines develop. Regional collaboration achieves efficiencies unavailable to isolated facilities. Value-based payment creates sustainability incentives. MAHA-aligned wellness programming positions Oklahoma for continued federal support.\nThe plan’s limitations are equally clear. Tribal coordination requires sovereign government participation Oklahoma cannot compel. Technology serves connected populations while bypassing those without broadband. Workforce pipelines produce providers after RHTP ends. Hospital stabilization operates within prohibited parameters that prevent direct revenue support.\nPart 3 will assess which initiatives succeed, which struggle against implementation constraints, what gets cut when resources fall short, and whether Oklahoma’s tribal integration opportunity produces the acceleration the theory of change assumes. The state’s unique assets meet its near-worst starting position in America’s largest experiment in rural health transformation.\nCross-References RHTP 3.OK.1: Oklahoma, The Problem (Part 1 baseline analysis) RHTP 3.OK.3: Oklahoma, The Analysis (Part 3, forthcoming) RHTP 2.A: RHTP Structure and Rules (Federal program framework) RHTP 2.B: Medicaid Architecture (Coverage context) RHTP 2.E: Indian Health Service and Tribal Systems (Tribal health infrastructure) RHTP 2.G: MAHA Policy Alignment (Wellness initiative context) Sources Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. “CMS Announces $50 Billion in Awards to Strengthen Rural Health in All 50 States.” CMS Newsroom, 29 Dec. 2025, www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-announces-50-billion-awards.\nHealthy Minds Policy Initiative. “Behavioral Health Strategies for Oklahoma’s RHTP Application.” Healthy Minds Policy, 2025, www.healthymindspolicy.org/policy/behavioral-health-strategies-for-oklahomas-application.\nHealth Resources and Services Administration. “Oklahoma Maternal Health Morbidity and Mortality Annual Report 2025.” MCHB TVIS, 2025, mchb.tvisdata.hrsa.gov/Narratives/Overview.\nIndian Health Service. “Oklahoma City Area Healthcare Facilities.” IHS, 2025, www.ihs.gov/oklahomacity/healthcarefacilities/.\nOklahoma Governor’s Office. “Oklahoma Lands Historic Funding to Reimagine Rural Health Care.” Office of Governor Kevin Stitt, 29 Dec. 2025, oklahoma.gov/governor/newsroom/newsroom/2025/oklahoma-lands-historic-funding-to-reimagine-rural-health-care.html.\nOklahoma Health Care Authority. “Medicaid Expansion.” OHCA, 2025, oklahoma.gov/ohca/about/medicaid-expansion/expansion.html.\nOklahoma Hospital Association. “Workforce.” OHA, 2025, www.okoha.com/OHA/Health_Care_Issues/Workforce_/Workforce.aspx.\nOklahoma State Department of Health. “Rural Health Transformation Program.” OSDH, 2025, oklahoma.gov/health/rhtp.html.\nThis is Part 2 of the priority state analysis for Oklahoma.

  </a>
</div>

<p>Part 1 established the baseline: <strong>$223.5 million for 1.47 million rural Oklahomans</strong> translates to approximately $152 per person annually, placing Oklahoma in the upper tier of per capita allocations. Forty-nine out of fifty in health system performance. Sixty-four percent of rural hospitals at risk. The worst breast cancer mortality in the nation. These are the conditions the Oklahoma State Department of Health must transform with resources that, while favorable by national comparison, remain modest against the scale of dysfunction.</p>
<p>Oklahoma responded with a <strong>six-initiative strategy</strong> organizing transformation around tribal health integration, technology deployment, workforce development, and regional collaboration. The application leveraged what no other state possesses: 39 federally recognized tribes operating extensive health systems that serve both tribal citizens and, through various coordination arrangements, broader rural populations.</p>
<p>The central premise: Oklahoma&rsquo;s unique tribal health infrastructure creates <strong>integration opportunities that can accelerate transformation</strong> beyond what standalone state efforts achieve. Tribal systems bring workforce, facilities, community trust, and operational capacity that decades of state investment failed to build. RHTP funding can catalyze coordination rather than construct infrastructure from scratch.</p>
<p>Whether this premise holds will determine if Oklahoma&rsquo;s favorable funding position translates to improved outcomes or merely well-documented activity.</p>

<h3 id="lead-agency-and-implementation-partners">Lead Agency and Implementation Partners<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#lead-agency-and-implementation-partners">#</a></h3>
<p>The <strong>Oklahoma State Department of Health (OSDH)</strong> serves as lead agency and cooperative agreement holder. Commissioner Heather Maughan bears ultimate responsibility for program implementation, reporting, and compliance with CMS requirements.</p>
<p>Implementation involves multi-agency coordination reflecting the reality that rural health transformation touches domains beyond OSDH&rsquo;s direct authority:</p>

</table>
<p>The governance structure intentionally positions OSDH as coordinator rather than sole implementer. Rural health transformation requires Medicaid payment systems, behavioral health capacity, workforce training, and technology infrastructure that no single agency controls. OSDH must align agencies with different statutory missions, budget processes, and political leadership.</p>
<h3 id="tribal-consultation-and-coordination">Tribal Consultation and Coordination<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#tribal-consultation-and-coordination">#</a></h3>
<p>Oklahoma&rsquo;s application emerged from <strong>genuine tribal consultation</strong> with more than 60 tribal representatives participating in planning discussions. This consultation was not performative compliance with federal requirements. Tribal health systems in Oklahoma operate at scale sufficient to influence program design, and tribal representatives possessed technical expertise and operational knowledge that shaped initiative structure.</p>
<p>The coordination structure creates joint planning mechanisms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Joint planning committees</strong> including tribal and state health officials</li>
<li><strong>Service coordination protocols</strong> defining referral pathways between systems</li>
<li><strong>Data sharing agreements</strong> bridging IHS, tribal, and state health information systems</li>
<li><strong>Workforce development partnerships</strong> serving both tribal and general rural populations</li>
<li><strong>Cultural competency requirements</strong> ensuring program design reflects tribal input</li>
</ul>
<p>The practical challenge: tribal nations are sovereign governments, not state agencies or contractors. Coordination requires government-to-government relationships with 39 distinct tribal governments, each with its own priorities, capacity, and relationships with federal agencies. OSDH cannot direct tribal participation; it can only create frameworks that make participation beneficial for tribal health systems.</p>
<h2 id="strategic-framework">Strategic Framework<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#strategic-framework">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="theory-of-change">Theory of Change<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#theory-of-change">#</a></h3>
<p>Oklahoma&rsquo;s theory of change assumes that <strong>bringing care closer to home through technology, transportation, and workforce development</strong> will improve outcomes while regional collaboration and value-based payment create sustainability. The state explicitly designed initiatives with post-2030 funding sources in mind: billable services, provider-assumed costs, ongoing government funding, private funding, and one-time capital investments that yield durable infrastructure.</p>
<p>The logic model:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Tribal integration accelerates transformation.</strong> Tribal health systems provide workforce, facilities, and community relationships that decades of state effort failed to build. RHTP catalyzes coordination rather than constructing parallel infrastructure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Technology extends capacity faster than workforce alone.</strong> Telehealth, remote monitoring, and AI-assisted triage expand provider reach while workforce pipelines produce additional practitioners over longer horizons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Regional collaboration achieves economies unavailable to isolated facilities.</strong> Shared purchasing, coordinated staffing, and referral networks improve efficiency for facilities that cannot achieve scale individually.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Value-based payment creates sustainability incentives.</strong> Transition from fee-for-service to outcomes-based reimbursement aligns provider incentives with population health improvement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Upstream prevention reduces chronic disease burden.</strong> Investment in wellness programming, chronic disease management, and behavioral health integration addresses Oklahoma&rsquo;s leading causes of poor outcomes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="theory-vulnerabilities">Theory Vulnerabilities<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#theory-vulnerabilities">#</a></h3>
<p>The theory assumes tribal health systems will coordinate with state programs despite historical tensions between tribal governments and state authority. It assumes technology deployment reaches populations with connectivity, which remains incomplete in significant portions of rural Oklahoma. It assumes workforce pipelines produce practitioners who stay in Oklahoma rather than migrating to higher-paying markets. Each assumption could fail.</p>
<h2 id="six-rhtp-initiatives">Six RHTP Initiatives<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#six-rhtp-initiatives">#</a></h2>
<p>Oklahoma organizes transformation around six interconnected initiatives addressing access, prevention, workforce, collaboration, payment reform, and technology infrastructure.</p>
<h3 id="initiative-1-innovating-the-care-model">Initiative 1: Innovating the Care Model<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#initiative-1-innovating-the-care-model">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Focus</strong>: Telehealth expansion, transportation support, expanded care teams, local infrastructure investment.</p>
<p>This initiative directly addresses access barriers by bringing services to communities rather than requiring travel. Mobile wellness units deliver preventive services in communities lacking fixed facilities. Virtual specialist consultations connect rural patients with cardiology, dermatology, psychiatry, and other specialties that rural communities cannot support through permanent staffing. Ride scheduling tools and local driver programs address transportation as the barrier it actually is for populations without reliable vehicles.</p>
<p><strong>Key components</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mobile wellness units serving isolated communities</li>
<li>Telehealth platform deployment across rural facilities</li>
<li>Virtual specialist consultation networks</li>
<li>Transportation coordination and ride scheduling</li>
<li>Expanded care team models integrating CHWs, pharmacists, and behavioral health</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Implementation timeline</strong>: Mobile units and telehealth platforms deploy Year 1. Specialist consultation networks establish Year 2. Full expansion through Year 5.</p>
<h3 id="initiative-2-moving-upstream">Initiative 2: Moving Upstream<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#initiative-2-moving-upstream">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Focus</strong>: Chronic disease prevention and management, community-led wellness programs.</p>
<p>Oklahoma&rsquo;s burden of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease demands upstream intervention. The state&rsquo;s five leading health improvement priorities all involve chronic conditions that prevention and management programs can address. Programs emphasize physical fitness, nutrition, and evidence-based chronic disease management aligned with <strong>Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) priorities</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Key components</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Diabetes Prevention Program expansion</li>
<li>Community fitness and wellness programming</li>
<li>Nutrition education and food access initiatives</li>
<li>Chronic disease self-management support</li>
<li>School and workplace wellness integration</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MAHA alignment</strong>: Initiative 2 explicitly brands around federal wellness priorities, positioning Oklahoma for favorable scoring in annual re-evaluation. Lifestyle intervention emphasis matches administration priorities while addressing Oklahoma&rsquo;s genuine chronic disease burden.</p>
<h3 id="initiative-3-growing-the-next-generation-of-rural-talent">Initiative 3: Growing the Next Generation of Rural Talent<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#initiative-3-growing-the-next-generation-of-rural-talent">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Focus</strong>: &ldquo;Grow your own&rdquo; workforce initiatives, training placements, recruitment and retention programs.</p>
<p>Building on models like the <strong>OSU-COM Cherokee Nation Campus</strong> that demonstrates 70% in-state residency placement, Oklahoma aims to train local students who will practice locally. Pipeline development spans community health workers through physicians, recognizing that different workforce categories have different training timelines and retention dynamics.</p>
<p><strong>Key components</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>CHW training and certification expansion</li>
<li>Clinical training placements in rural and tribal settings</li>
<li>Loan repayment and scholarship programs</li>
<li>Recruitment partnerships with training institutions</li>
<li>Retention support for practicing rural providers</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Timeline reality</strong>: Physician training produces practitioners in 2032 at earliest. Nurse practitioner and PA programs take three to four years. CHW training produces workers within twelve to eighteen months. Initiative 3 front-loads CHW deployment while building longer-term pipelines.</p>
<h3 id="initiative-4-facilitating-regional-collaboration">Initiative 4: Facilitating Regional Collaboration<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#initiative-4-facilitating-regional-collaboration">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Focus</strong>: Shared operations, technology, coordinated care across providers.</p>
<p>Rural facilities working together on purchasing, staffing, and service coordination can achieve efficiencies that isolated operations cannot. Regional networks create referral pathways and specialist access while reducing duplication of administrative functions.</p>
<p><strong>Key components</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regional health network development</li>
<li>Shared purchasing and supply chain coordination</li>
<li>Coordinated staffing pools for coverage</li>
<li>Referral pathway formalization</li>
<li>Administrative service consolidation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tribal integration point</strong>: Regional collaboration necessarily involves tribal facilities that serve as primary care sources in many rural areas. Network development must bridge tribal and non-tribal systems rather than creating parallel coordination structures.</p>
<h3 id="initiative-5-shifting-to-value">Initiative 5: Shifting to Value<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#initiative-5-shifting-to-value">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Focus</strong>: Technical assistance for value-based care transition, infrastructure development, quality incentive programs.</p>
<p>Oklahoma&rsquo;s <strong>SoonerSelect managed care transition</strong> in 2024 created foundation for value-based payment. RHTP accelerates rural provider readiness for outcomes-based reimbursement rather than building from scratch. Technical assistance helps rural providers understand quality reporting requirements, manage population health data, and demonstrate outcomes that generate value-based payment.</p>
<p><strong>Key components</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Value-based care technical assistance</li>
<li>Quality reporting infrastructure</li>
<li>Population health management tools</li>
<li>Performance incentive program design</li>
<li>Managed care organization coordination</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>SoonerSelect alignment</strong>: The $700 million in directed payments flowing through SoonerSelect creates financial stakes for value-based performance. RHTP investment positions rural providers to succeed under payment models that will persist beyond federal funding.</p>
<h3 id="initiative-6-building-health-data-utility">Initiative 6: Building Health Data Utility<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#initiative-6-building-health-data-utility">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Focus</strong>: EHR upgrades, interoperability, data sharing, analytics platforms.</p>
<p>Connected health records reduce duplicate testing, improve care coordination, and enable population health management. This digital backbone underlies all other initiatives. Providers cannot coordinate care without shared information. Quality cannot be measured without data infrastructure. Value-based payment requires outcomes tracking that fragmented systems cannot support.</p>
<p><strong>Key components</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>EHR upgrade and standardization support</li>
<li>Health information exchange enhancement</li>
<li>Interoperability across tribal and non-tribal systems</li>
<li>Analytics platforms for population health management</li>
<li>Patient data access and portal integration</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IHS PATH alignment</strong>: The federal <strong>IHS PATH EHR modernization</strong> pilots at Lawton Indian Hospital in 2026. Aligning RHTP health data utility investments with PATH implementation could accelerate interoperability across the tribal/non-tribal divide, creating connected systems that neither federal nor state investment could achieve independently.</p>

<h3 id="tribal-health-integration">Tribal Health Integration<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#tribal-health-integration">#</a></h3>
<p>Oklahoma&rsquo;s RHTP represents the <strong>most significant tribal health integration opportunity</strong> in the program nationally. Coordination with 39 tribes and extensive IHS/tribal facility infrastructure creates pathways unavailable elsewhere:</p>
<p><strong>Joint planning</strong>: Tribal consultation with more than 60 representatives shaped application design, not merely validated state-developed plans.</p>
<p><strong>Service coordination</strong>: Referral networks connecting tribal and non-tribal facilities create care pathways that leverage tribal capacity for populations served by both systems.</p>
<p><strong>Workforce sharing</strong>: Training programs serving both tribal and general rural populations avoid duplication while building workforce serving multiple systems.</p>
<p><strong>Technology alignment</strong>: Data sharing infrastructure bridging IHS and state systems enables care coordination that fragmented systems prevent.</p>
<p><strong>Cultural competency</strong>: Programs designed with tribal input ensure appropriate care delivery for populations with distinct health beliefs and practices.</p>

<p>Oklahoma&rsquo;s <strong>transportation investments</strong> directly address a critical barrier: many rural residents cannot access care without ride assistance. The state&rsquo;s mobile wellness units bring care to communities rather than requiring travel. These approaches acknowledge that technology solutions alone cannot serve populations lacking vehicles and internet access.</p>

<p>OSDH maintains CHW licensing and certification infrastructure that RHTP can scale. Training programs, supervision structures, and reimbursement pathways exist; funding accelerates deployment. The tribal health system&rsquo;s extensive use of <strong>community health representatives</strong> provides models for non-tribal adaptation.</p>
<p><strong>CHW expansion components</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Training program capacity increase</li>
<li>Certification pathway streamlining</li>
<li>Supervision infrastructure support</li>
<li>Reimbursement advocacy with managed care organizations</li>
<li>Deployment in highest-need communities</li>
</ul>
<p>CHWs produce within twelve to eighteen months of training initiation. Unlike physician pipelines requiring decade-long investment, CHW programs yield workers within RHTP&rsquo;s window who can then contribute to transformation during the program period.</p>

<h3 id="explicit-assumptions">Explicit Assumptions<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#explicit-assumptions">#</a></h3>
<p>Oklahoma&rsquo;s plan explicitly assumes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Tribal health systems will coordinate genuinely.</strong> Integration requires 39 sovereign governments choosing to participate in frameworks Oklahoma designs. Tribal governments have their own priorities, capacities, and relationships with federal agencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Technology reaches underserved populations.</strong> Telehealth and data infrastructure serve communities with connectivity. Significant portions of rural Oklahoma lack broadband meeting minimum federal standards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Value-based payment produces sustainability.</strong> Transition from fee-for-service to outcomes-based reimbursement creates incentives that persist beyond federal funding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Workforce pipelines retain graduates in Oklahoma.</strong> Training programs produce practitioners who stay rather than migrating to higher-paying markets in Dallas, Houston, or Kansas City.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="implicit-assumptions">Implicit Assumptions<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#implicit-assumptions">#</a></h3>
<p>The plan implicitly assumes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Medicaid cuts do not overwhelm transformation investment.</strong> Projected $8.7 billion in Medicaid losses over the decade could offset RHTP&rsquo;s $1.12 billion five-year investment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hospital closure trajectory stabilizes.</strong> Twenty-two facilities at immediate closure risk cannot all survive through transformation investment that RHTP prohibits from direct operating support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mental health treatment gaps prove addressable.</strong> Eighty to ninety-five percent untreated rates may reflect capacity constraints that workforce development cannot resolve within program timelines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Constitutional Medicaid protection provides sufficient stability.</strong> Federal cuts may erode coverage despite state constitutional protection of expansion.</p>
</li>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>Oklahoma proposes to transform rural healthcare for 1.47 million residents through <strong>six interconnected initiatives</strong> leveraging what no other state possesses: 39 federally recognized tribes operating extensive health systems that can coordinate with state transformation efforts.</p>
<p>The plan is rational within its constraints. Tribal integration offers genuine acceleration opportunity. Technology extends capacity while workforce pipelines develop. Regional collaboration achieves efficiencies unavailable to isolated facilities. Value-based payment creates sustainability incentives. MAHA-aligned wellness programming positions Oklahoma for continued federal support.</p>
<p>The plan&rsquo;s limitations are equally clear. Tribal coordination requires sovereign government participation Oklahoma cannot compel. Technology serves connected populations while bypassing those without broadband. Workforce pipelines produce providers after RHTP ends. Hospital stabilization operates within prohibited parameters that prevent direct revenue support.</p>
<p><strong>Part 3 will assess</strong> which initiatives succeed, which struggle against implementation constraints, what gets cut when resources fall short, and whether Oklahoma&rsquo;s tribal integration opportunity produces the acceleration the theory of change assumes. The state&rsquo;s unique assets meet its near-worst starting position in America&rsquo;s largest experiment in rural health transformation.</p>
