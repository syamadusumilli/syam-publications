  "articleBody": "January 2026\nMaryland received $168,180,838 in RHTP funding for FY2026, ranking among the lowest allocations nationally alongside Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and New Jersey. For a state often associated with the Baltimore-Washington metropolitan corridor, this positioning reflects both demographic reality and formula mechanics that reward vast geography over concentrated rural need. Maryland’s rural challenges concentrate in two distinct regions where health disparities persist despite the state’s overall wealth and healthcare infrastructure sophistication.\nThe state submitted a $1 billion application across three interconnected initiatives spanning workforce transformation, innovative care delivery, and nutrition intervention. Receiving approximately 17% of that request requires strategic prioritization. What emerges is an approach that leverages Maryland’s unique all-payer hospital system and existing healthcare innovation capacity to address rural needs that metropolitan prosperity obscures from national view.\nState Context The Geography of Hidden Rurality\nMaryland spans 9,707 square miles of land area stretching from the Appalachian Mountains in the west to the Atlantic Ocean in the east. The Chesapeake Bay bisects the state, creating the Delmarva Peninsula’s Eastern Shore as a region physically separated from the Baltimore-Washington core. Western Maryland’s mountainous terrain creates a different form of isolation, where Allegany and Garrett Counties share more geographic affinity with West Virginia and Pennsylvania than with Annapolis or Baltimore.\nThe Baltimore-National Capital regions account for 82.2% of Maryland’s population. The remaining three regions, including Western Maryland, Southern Maryland, and the Eastern Shore, account for just 17.8% of state residents. This concentration creates a metropolitan-dominated policy environment where rural health needs compete for attention against the healthcare politics of one of the nation’s wealthiest and most medically dense corridors.\nDefinitional Complexity\nMaryland’s rural population varies dramatically depending on classification methodology. The U.S. Census Bureau identifies approximately 272,744 nonmetro residents, representing just 4.4% of the state’s 6.2 million population. This places Maryland among the most urbanized states in the nation.\nThe Maryland State Office of Rural Health employs a broader definition accepted by HRSA for planning purposes. This framework encompasses 18 of the state’s 24 jurisdictions as rural, covering approximately 80% of Maryland’s land area and 25% of its population. The definitional gap shapes RHTP allocation mechanics: formula calculations based on narrow federal definitions undercount Maryland’s rural service needs.\nUsing Census nonmetro population, Maryland’s RHTP allocation calculates to approximately $617 per rural resident annually. Using state-defined rural population produces a lower per-capita figure but reflects actual service delivery geography more accurately.\nRegional Profiles\nThe Eastern Shore comprises nine counties on the Delmarva Peninsula: Caroline, Cecil, Dorchester, Kent, Queen Anne’s, Somerset, Talbot, Wicomico, and Worcester. The region contains approximately 455,000 residents with an average population density of 138 persons per square mile, roughly one-fifth the state average.\nThe Eastern Shore has an older population than Maryland overall, with 19% of residents aged 65 or older compared to 15% statewide. Nearly three-quarters of Eastern Shore residents are white, though the region includes significant Black population concentrations in Somerset County (42%) and growing Latinx communities across agricultural areas.\nWestern Maryland includes Allegany, Garrett, Frederick, and Washington Counties, with Allegany and Garrett representing the most rural and isolated. Cumberland serves as the regional hub, but significant portions of western Maryland lie beyond practical commuting distance from any hospital. The region shares Appalachian economic and health challenges with neighboring West Virginia.\nSouthern Maryland (Charles, Calvert, St. Mary’s Counties) contains rural communities interspersed with expanding suburban development from the Washington, D.C. corridor. Rural healthcare access challenges persist in communities distant from the region’s hospital anchors.\nHealth Disparities Workforce Shortages Across the State\nHealthcare workforce distribution creates access barriers even in a state with nationally prominent academic medical centers. HRSA data indicates that 19 of Maryland’s 24 jurisdictions are currently either entirely or partially designated as health professional shortage areas for primary care and/or dental services. Eighteen jurisdictions are shortage areas for mental health providers.\nTwenty-three of 24 jurisdictions are currently either fully or partially designated as medically underserved areas. The near-universality of these designations, in a state with Johns Hopkins, the University of Maryland Medical Center, and MedStar systems, illustrates how metropolitan provider concentration fails to address distributed population needs.\nThe Eastern Shore faces the most severe shortages. All five counties with the fewest primary care physicians per capita are on the Eastern Shore. Caroline County has the greatest need with only one primary care provider per 2,500 residents. More than 1 million Marylanders live in medically underserved areas, predominantly on the Eastern Shore and in Western Maryland.\nHealth Outcomes\nRural Maryland residents experience measurably worse health outcomes than their metropolitan counterparts. Eastern Shore mortality rates demonstrate the pattern:\nCounty Age-Adjusted Crude Death Rate (per 100,000) Wicomico 1,014.0 Worcester 940.2 Somerset 997.2 Maryland Overall 766.5 These elevated mortality rates reflect multiple contributing factors: older population demographics, healthcare access challenges, chronic disease burden, and the socioeconomic determinants that rural communities experience. Somerset County has a 67.8% higher age-adjusted heart disease death rate than the state average. Wicomico County runs 44.4% higher on the same measure.\nInfant and child mortality follows similar patterns. Four Eastern Shore counties rank among the top five in Maryland for infant and child mortality, with Somerset and Caroline Counties appearing in both age group rankings.\nLife expectancy varies by as much as seven years between some Eastern Shore counties and top-ranked Maryland jurisdictions. In a state known for world-class healthcare institutions, these disparities illustrate how excellence in Baltimore and Bethesda fails to reach the farms, fishing communities, and mountain towns that comprise rural Maryland.\nHealthcare Infrastructure No Critical Access Hospitals\nMaryland is one of only five states with zero Critical Access Hospitals, alongside Connecticut, Delaware, New Jersey, and Rhode Island. The state does not participate in the Medicare Flex Program that supports CAH designation in other states. Maryland’s unique all-payer hospital rate-setting system provides alternative mechanisms for rural hospital financial stability.\nThe state also has zero Rural Health Clinics and zero Rural Emergency Hospitals under federal designation criteria. This infrastructure absence reflects Maryland’s regulatory structure rather than healthcare system weakness.\nRural Hospital Network\nDespite lacking CAH designations, Maryland maintains functioning rural hospitals through its Health Services Cost Review Commission (HSCRC) regulatory framework:\nSystem Facilities Rural Coverage UM Shore Regional Health Chestertown, Easton, Cambridge (freestanding medical facility) Five Eastern Shore counties: Caroline, Dorchester, Kent, Queen Anne’s, Talbot TidalHealth Peninsula Regional Medical Center (Salisbury) Lower Eastern Shore: Wicomico, Worcester, Somerset UPMC Western Maryland Cumberland (regional hub) Allegany and Garrett Counties MedStar St. Mary’s Hospital Leonardtown Southern Maryland: St. Mary’s County Frederick Health Frederick Western corridor: Frederick County Meritus Medical Center Hagerstown Washington County UM Shore Regional Health represents Maryland’s primary rural hospital system, serving a 2,000 square mile region across the mid-Eastern Shore. The system operates hospitals in Chestertown (Maryland’s first designated Rural Hospital) and Easton, plus freestanding emergency centers in Chester and Denton. UM Shore is currently constructing a $540 million Shore Regional Medical Center in Easton, a six-story facility with 122 private inpatient beds, 27 emergency department treatment bays, and specialty services including an acute rehabilitation center, birthing center, and cardiac intervention unit.\nFederally Qualified Health Centers\nMaryland has 32 FQHC sites operating outside Census-defined urban areas, providing primary care access to underserved populations. These centers serve as critical access points where private practice concentration is insufficient. FQHCs in rural Maryland operate on 40%+ Medicaid dependence for patient revenue, making them particularly vulnerable to federal Medicaid coverage changes.\nThe Maryland Model All-Payer Rate Setting\nMaryland operates the only state-based all-payer hospital rate-setting system in the nation. Since the 1970s, the Health Services Cost Review Commission (HSCRC) has regulated hospital payment rates for all payers, including Medicare, Medicaid, commercial insurers, and self-pay patients. All payers pay the same rate for the same service at the same hospital.\nThis regulatory framework provides rural hospital financial stability unavailable to rural hospitals in other states. The system spreads uncompensated care costs across all payers rather than concentrating them on hospitals serving high proportions of uninsured patients. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Maryland hospitals avoided the massive revenue shortfalls that forced layoffs and service cuts elsewhere because global budget revenue maintained financial predictability regardless of volume fluctuations.\nGlobal Budget Revenue\nUnder the all-payer model, each Maryland hospital receives a predetermined annual revenue amount. Payment rates adjust quarterly to ensure actual revenues match budgeted figures. This approach eliminates the volume incentive that drives unnecessary utilization elsewhere while protecting hospitals from financial volatility.\nFor rural hospitals specifically, global budgets ensure that seasonal fluctuations (particularly relevant for Eastern Shore tourism communities) and year-to-year demand variations do not threaten institutional viability. UM Shore Medical Center at Chestertown and similar facilities can plan staffing and services around predictable revenue rather than scrambling to manage volume-driven uncertainty.\nAHEAD Model Transition\nMaryland is transitioning from the Total Cost of Care (TCOC) Model to the AHEAD (Advancing All-Payer Health Equity Approaches and Development) Model beginning January 2026. This federal-state partnership extends the all-payer framework while adding population health accountability. The AHEAD model aligns with RHTP sustainability goals by providing the payment infrastructure that can maintain transformed care delivery beyond the 2030 funding sunset.\nHowever, the Trump administration has signaled interest in altering the AHEAD agreement, specifically regarding Maryland’s authority to set Medicare rates. If HSCRC authority is reduced or eliminated, hospitals may begin negotiating prices directly with insurers. Rural hospitals operating on thin margins could face significant financial strain. Governor Wes Moore created a regulatory working group to address AHEAD implementation alongside One Big Beautiful Bill Act implications.\nRHTP Strategy Three-Initiative Framework\nMaryland organized its RHTP application around three strategic areas:\nInitiative Focus Key Components 1. Transform the Rural Health Workforce Pipeline development, recruitment, retention Apprenticeships, AHEC expansion, physician training, CHW certification 2. Promote Sustainable Access and Innovative Care Care delivery transformation Mobile health, school-based health centers, telehealth, value-based care 3. Empower Rural Marylanders to Eat for Health Food is Medicine Post-harvest infrastructure, healthy food access, nutrition education Each initiative divides funding between Immediate Impact (shovel-ready activities) and Transformation Funds (competitive, longer-term planning required).\nWorkforce Transformation\nMaryland’s workforce strategy addresses the cascade of shortages affecting rural communities:\nImmediate Impact Funding\nNew apprenticeships and expanded certificate programs for community health workers, nursing assistants, and peer recovery specialists Area Health Education Center (AHEC) expansions connecting rural students with hands-on experience and clinical rotations in rural areas Improved information technology for workforce development data tracking Transformation Funding\nPipeline programs for career exploration and upskilling opportunities Public health service corps modeled on successful loan repayment programs Training, recruitment, and retention support for physicians and advanced practice professionals The University of Maryland School of Medicine launched its Rural-MD Scholars program in October 2024, funded by a $1.4 million state grant, aiming to eventually place 10 new physicians annually into Eastern Shore healthcare facilities. RHTP resources can accelerate and expand this pipeline approach.\nSustainable Access and Innovative Care\nImmediate Impact Funding\nNew and expanded capacity for rural primary care, specialty practices, and school-based health centers Improved efficiency of local agency care provision Better-equipped trauma response Expanded and optimized health information technology connectivity Infrastructure to spur broader telehealth adoption Transformation Funding\nSustainable access via expanded healthcare capacity and integrated technology Mobile health units in each rural region Provider support for adoption of value-based, innovative care Behavioral health expansions across the full care continuum Mobile health represents a significant investment given documented challenges. Prior mobile clinic deployments in Maryland have closed due to cost-effectiveness concerns when utilization proved insufficient. The state’s telehealth emphasis may prove more realistic given connectivity infrastructure already in place in many areas.\nEat for Health\nMaryland’s third initiative represents one of the most comprehensive Food is Medicine strategies in any RHTP application:\nImmediate Impact Funding\nPost-harvest infrastructure for small farms to supply local markets with fresh food Increased healthy food access through support for grocers and mobile markets in hunger “hot spots” Nutrition education to create demand for healthy foods Better regional planning and coordination for healthy food access Transformation Funding\nFood aggregators and food hubs to increase availability of affordable, local foods New organizational purchasing strategies to pivot procurement toward healthy, local foods Maryland’s agricultural heritage, particularly on the Eastern Shore, creates opportunity to connect local food production with rural health system nutrition programming. The “Eat for Health” initiative aligns with MAHA policy priorities while addressing documented food access challenges in rural communities where grocery store availability is limited and food insecurity rates exceed state averages.\nProgram Allocation Based on application priorities, estimated program allocations include:\nProgram Area Estimated Allocation Implementing Partners Workforce Pipeline $45 million MDH, AHECs, UMSOM, UMD Extension Mobile Health/Expanded Access $35 million UM Shore, TidalHealth, UPMC Western MD School-Based Health Centers $20 million County health departments, school systems Telehealth Infrastructure $18 million CRISP (state HIE), hospital systems Behavioral Health Integration $18 million BHA, county health departments, hospital systems Food is Medicine/Post-Harvest $15 million MDA, local farms, food hubs Value-Based Care Transition $10 million HSCRC, participating providers Administrative/Oversight $7 million MDH State Office of Rural Health Note: Allocations are estimates based on application priorities. Final distributions pending CMS approval and state budget finalization.\nSocial Care Integration Maryland embeds social determinants components throughout its initiative structure:\nComponent Integration Approach Status SDOH/HRSN Screening Connected to school-based health centers, FQHCs, and mobile health units Expanding existing capacity Community Health Workers Apprenticeship and certification programs, deployment through healthcare and community settings Funded through Initiative 1 Food Security Eat for Health initiative addresses nutrition as clinical intervention Comprehensive strategy CIE Platform CRISP (Chesapeake Regional Information System for Our Patients) serves as state HIE with social services referral capability Operational, enhancement pending Transportation Addressed through mobile health strategy and telehealth expansion Infrastructure focus CRISP, Maryland’s statewide health information exchange, provides interoperability infrastructure that many states lack. The platform enables referral coordination and information sharing across healthcare and community service providers, supporting RHTP initiatives requiring cross-sector collaboration.\nMedicaid Context Maryland expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, providing coverage to approximately 1.5 million residents including significant rural populations. The state’s Medicaid expansion created coverage infrastructure that RHTP initiatives assume as baseline.\nHowever, federal Medicaid changes under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act create uncertainty:\nMetric Projected Impact Projected Annual Medicaid Cuts ~$2.5 billion Projected Coverage Losses ~200,000 residents Rural FQHC Medicaid Dependence 40%+ of revenue RHTP as % of Medicaid Cuts \u003c7% RHTP cannot legally backfill Medicaid reductions, creating a structural mismatch between transformation funding and potential coverage erosion. Rural hospitals and FQHCs with high Medicaid dependence face fiscal pressure that care model innovation cannot fully resolve.\nImplementation Assessment Strengths\nRegulatory Infrastructure: Maryland’s all-payer hospital system provides financial stability infrastructure unavailable elsewhere. Rural hospitals do not face the closure risk that defines rural health crises in other states. HSCRC can adjust rates to support rural hospital sustainability within the regulatory framework.\nHealth Information Exchange: CRISP provides operational statewide HIE infrastructure, reducing the technology development burden that many RHTP applications must address. The platform’s existing capabilities enable social services integration, care coordination, and data analytics that support transformation initiatives.\nAcademic Medical Center Partnership: UM Shore Regional Health’s relationship with the University of Maryland System provides specialty access, residency training capacity, and clinical expertise that standalone rural systems lack. The Rural-MD Scholars program demonstrates institutional commitment to rural workforce development.\nFood System Assets: The Eastern Shore’s agricultural economy, including significant produce, poultry, and seafood production, creates opportunity for Food is Medicine implementation that leverages local supply rather than importing intervention capacity.\nVulnerabilities\nPolitical Environment: Maryland’s metropolitan-dominated policy environment may not sustain rural health focus when RHTP funds end. Legislative attention concentrates on Baltimore and suburban Washington corridor priorities where most voters reside.\nMobile Health Economics: Prior mobile clinic closures due to insufficient utilization raise questions about mobile health strategy viability. The state’s emphasis on mobile units assumes demand that experience has not consistently demonstrated.\nAHEAD Uncertainty: Federal administration interest in altering Maryland’s rate-setting authority creates implementation risk. If HSCRC powers are reduced, the financial stability framework supporting rural hospitals could weaken precisely as RHTP investments are deployed.\nLimited Federal Rural Infrastructure: The absence of CAHs, REHs, and RHCs means Maryland lacks facilities operating under rural-specific federal payment frameworks. Strategies designed around these designations require adaptation to Maryland’s regulatory context.\nSustainability Considerations The 2030 Question\nMaryland’s sustainability strategy centers on leveraging the all-payer system and AHEAD transition to maintain transformed care delivery:\nPayment Model Alignment: Value-based payment initiatives through HSCRC create economic logic for sustaining RHTP innovations. If global budgets incentivize prevention, care coordination, and population health improvement, payment reforms maintain what RHTP resources establish.\nInfrastructure Investment: Many RHTP investments represent one-time capital costs (mobile units, telehealth equipment, post-harvest infrastructure) that create capacity sustained through subsequent service reimbursement and agricultural economics.\nWorkforce Pipeline: Training programs create future providers who will practice for decades beyond the 2030 funding sunset. Each physician retained in rural Maryland represents 25-30 years of practice capacity from a five-year training investment.\nWhat Survives Partial Funding\nGiven Maryland received approximately 17% of its request, prioritization will determine implementation scope:\nLikely Preserved: Workforce training and certification programs, AHEC expansion, telehealth infrastructure, CRISP enhancements, school-based health center expansion\nUncertain: Full mobile health deployment across all rural regions, comprehensive Food is Medicine infrastructure, behavioral health expansion to full continuum\nAt Risk: Some post-harvest agricultural infrastructure, complete food hub network, workforce recruitment incentives at requested levels\nConclusion Maryland demonstrates that metropolitan state prominence does not eliminate rural health challenges. The Eastern Shore and Western Maryland face provider shortages, health disparities, and access barriers that mirror rural America’s broader struggles despite the state’s wealth, healthcare sophistication, and regulatory innovation.\nThe state’s $168 million allocation enables meaningful investment calibrated to Maryland’s unique conditions: an all-payer system that stabilizes rural hospital finances, academic medical center partnerships that extend specialty capacity, and agricultural assets that support Food is Medicine implementation.\nSuccess depends on navigating AHEAD model uncertainty, sustaining rural health focus in metropolitan-dominated political environment, and demonstrating that mobile health and telehealth investments achieve access improvements that prior efforts have not consistently delivered. Maryland’s experience will test whether regulatory innovation and existing infrastructure can accelerate transformation in states where rural populations constitute a minority of political attention but face majority-scale health disparities.\nThe fundamental question extends beyond Maryland: if a state with world-class healthcare institutions, unique payment regulatory authority, and substantial state fiscal capacity cannot address its own rural health disparities, what does that reveal about the structural nature of rural health challenges nationwide?\nCross-References RHTP 2.A: RHTP Structure and Rules (statutory framework) RHTP 2.B: Medicaid Architecture (expansion context) RHTP 2.G: MAHA Policy Alignment (Eat for Health alignment) RHTP 3.DE: Delaware (regional comparison, limited rural context) RHTP 3.MA: Massachusetts (similar urban-dominated state) RHTP 3.NJ: New Jersey (similar formula mechanics impact) RHTP 3.PA: Pennsylvania (regional comparison, AHEAD cohort) RHTP 3.WV: West Virginia (Western Maryland regional context) RHTP 4.F: Payment Model Innovation (AHEAD model analysis) RHTP 4.H: Social Needs Integration (Food is Medicine context) Sources Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. “CMS Announces $50 Billion in Awards to Strengthen Rural Health in All 50 States.” CMS Newsroom, 29 Dec. 2025, www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-announces-50-billion-awards.\nFlex Monitoring Team. “Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs) Overview.” Rural Health Information Hub, 2025, www.ruralhealthinfo.org/topics/critical-access-hospitals.\nHealth Services Cost Review Commission. “Maryland’s All-Payer Hospital Payment System.” HSCRC, 2025, hscrc.maryland.gov/documents/pdr/generalinformation/marylandall-payorhospitalsystem.pdf.\nHealth Services Cost Review Commission. “Maryland’s Total Cost of Care Model Background and Summary.” HSCRC, 2018, hscrc.maryland.gov/documents/modernization/tcoc%20background%20and%20summary%20_5_23_18%20.pdf.\nKaiser Family Foundation. “Status of State Medicaid Expansion Decisions.” KFF, 1 Jan. 2026, www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/status-of-state-medicaid-expansion-decisions.\nMaryland Association of Counties. “2026 Issue Preview: Hospital Rate Setting and the AHEAD Model.” Conduit Street, 31 Dec. 2025, conduitstreet.mdcounties.org/2025/12/31/2026-issue-preview-hospital-rate-setting-and-the-ahead-model/.\nMaryland Center on Economic Policy. “Sustaining Strong Communities on Maryland’s Eastern Shore: Overview and Profile.” MDECONOMY, 2024, mdeconomy.org/es-overview/.\nMaryland Department of Health. “Rural Health Transformation Program.” MDH, 2025, health.maryland.gov/pophealth/Pages/Rural-Health-Transformation-Program.aspx.\nMaryland Department of Health. “Maryland Proposal for CMS’ Rural Health Transformation Program.” MDH, Nov. 2025, health.maryland.gov/pophealth/Documents/Rural%20Health/RHTP/Maryland-Proposal-for-CMS-Rural-Health-Transformation-Program.pdf.\nMaryland Department of Legislative Services. “Dashboard Demographics Population.” General Assembly of Maryland, 2025, dls.maryland.gov/data/dashboard-demographics-population.\nRural Health Information Hub. “Rural Health for Maryland Overview.” RHIhub, 2025, www.ruralhealthinfo.org/states/maryland.\nUniversity of Maryland School of Medicine. “Rural-MD Scholars.” UMSOM, 2024, www.medschool.umaryland.edu/ome/curriculum/rural-md-scholars/.\nSeries 3: State Implementation Rural Health Transformation Project Version 3: January 2026\n",

<p><em>January 2026</em></p>
<p>Maryland received <strong>$168,180,838</strong> in RHTP funding for FY2026, ranking among the lowest allocations nationally alongside Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and New Jersey. For a state often associated with the Baltimore-Washington metropolitan corridor, this positioning reflects both demographic reality and formula mechanics that reward vast geography over concentrated rural need. Maryland&rsquo;s rural challenges concentrate in <strong>two distinct regions</strong> where health disparities persist despite the state&rsquo;s overall wealth and healthcare infrastructure sophistication.</p>
<p>The state submitted a <strong>$1 billion application</strong> across three interconnected initiatives spanning workforce transformation, innovative care delivery, and nutrition intervention. Receiving approximately 17% of that request requires strategic prioritization. What emerges is an approach that leverages Maryland&rsquo;s <strong>unique all-payer hospital system</strong> and existing healthcare innovation capacity to address rural needs that metropolitan prosperity obscures from national view.</p>
<h2 id="state-context">State Context<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#state-context">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>The Geography of Hidden Rurality</strong></p>
<p>Maryland spans <strong>9,707 square miles</strong> of land area stretching from the Appalachian Mountains in the west to the Atlantic Ocean in the east. The Chesapeake Bay bisects the state, creating the <strong>Delmarva Peninsula&rsquo;s Eastern Shore</strong> as a region physically separated from the Baltimore-Washington core. Western Maryland&rsquo;s mountainous terrain creates a different form of isolation, where <strong>Allegany and Garrett Counties</strong> share more geographic affinity with West Virginia and Pennsylvania than with Annapolis or Baltimore.</p>
<p>The <strong>Baltimore-National Capital regions</strong> account for 82.2% of Maryland&rsquo;s population. The remaining three regions, including <strong>Western Maryland, Southern Maryland, and the Eastern Shore</strong>, account for just 17.8% of state residents. This concentration creates a metropolitan-dominated policy environment where rural health needs compete for attention against the healthcare politics of one of the nation&rsquo;s wealthiest and most medically dense corridors.</p>
<p><strong>Definitional Complexity</strong></p>
<p>Maryland&rsquo;s rural population varies dramatically depending on classification methodology. The <strong>U.S. Census Bureau</strong> identifies approximately <strong>272,744 nonmetro residents</strong>, representing just 4.4% of the state&rsquo;s 6.2 million population. This places Maryland among the most urbanized states in the nation.</p>
<p>The <strong>Maryland State Office of Rural Health</strong> employs a broader definition accepted by HRSA for planning purposes. This framework encompasses <strong>18 of the state&rsquo;s 24 jurisdictions</strong> as rural, covering approximately 80% of Maryland&rsquo;s land area and 25% of its population. The definitional gap shapes RHTP allocation mechanics: formula calculations based on narrow federal definitions undercount Maryland&rsquo;s rural service needs.</p>
<p>Using Census nonmetro population, Maryland&rsquo;s RHTP allocation calculates to approximately <strong>$617 per rural resident</strong> annually. Using state-defined rural population produces a lower per-capita figure but reflects actual service delivery geography more accurately.</p>
<p><strong>Regional Profiles</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Eastern Shore</strong> comprises nine counties on the Delmarva Peninsula: Caroline, Cecil, Dorchester, Kent, Queen Anne&rsquo;s, Somerset, Talbot, Wicomico, and Worcester. The region contains approximately <strong>455,000 residents</strong> with an average population density of 138 persons per square mile, roughly one-fifth the state average.</p>
<p>The Eastern Shore has an <strong>older population</strong> than Maryland overall, with 19% of residents aged 65 or older compared to 15% statewide. Nearly three-quarters of Eastern Shore residents are white, though the region includes significant Black population concentrations in Somerset County (42%) and growing Latinx communities across agricultural areas.</p>
<p><strong>Western Maryland</strong> includes Allegany, Garrett, Frederick, and Washington Counties, with Allegany and Garrett representing the most rural and isolated. Cumberland serves as the regional hub, but significant portions of western Maryland lie beyond practical commuting distance from any hospital. The region shares Appalachian economic and health challenges with neighboring West Virginia.</p>
<p><strong>Southern Maryland</strong> (Charles, Calvert, St. Mary&rsquo;s Counties) contains rural communities interspersed with expanding suburban development from the Washington, D.C. corridor. Rural healthcare access challenges persist in communities distant from the region&rsquo;s hospital anchors.</p>
<h2 id="health-disparities">Health Disparities<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#health-disparities">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Workforce Shortages Across the State</strong></p>
<p>Healthcare workforce distribution creates access barriers even in a state with nationally prominent academic medical centers. HRSA data indicates that <strong>19 of Maryland&rsquo;s 24 jurisdictions</strong> are currently either entirely or partially designated as health professional shortage areas for primary care and/or dental services. <strong>Eighteen jurisdictions</strong> are shortage areas for mental health providers.</p>
<p><strong>Twenty-three of 24 jurisdictions</strong> are currently either fully or partially designated as medically underserved areas. The near-universality of these designations, in a state with Johns Hopkins, the University of Maryland Medical Center, and MedStar systems, illustrates how metropolitan provider concentration fails to address distributed population needs.</p>
<p>The Eastern Shore faces the most severe shortages. <strong>All five counties</strong> with the fewest primary care physicians per capita are on the Eastern Shore. <strong>Caroline County</strong> has the greatest need with only one primary care provider per 2,500 residents. More than <strong>1 million Marylanders</strong> live in medically underserved areas, predominantly on the Eastern Shore and in Western Maryland.</p>
<p><strong>Health Outcomes</strong></p>
<p>Rural Maryland residents experience measurably worse health outcomes than their metropolitan counterparts. Eastern Shore mortality rates demonstrate the pattern:</p>
<table>
  <thead>
      <tr>
          <th>County</th>
          <th>Age-Adjusted Crude Death Rate (per 100,000)</th>
      </tr>
  </thead>

      <tr>
          <td>Wicomico</td>
          <td>1,014.0</td>

      <tr>
          <td>Maryland Overall</td>
          <td>766.5</td>
      </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>These elevated mortality rates reflect <strong>multiple contributing factors</strong>: older population demographics, healthcare access challenges, chronic disease burden, and the socioeconomic determinants that rural communities experience. Somerset County has a <strong>67.8% higher age-adjusted heart disease death rate</strong> than the state average. Wicomico County runs <strong>44.4% higher</strong> on the same measure.</p>
<p><strong>Infant and child mortality</strong> follows similar patterns. Four Eastern Shore counties rank among the top five in Maryland for infant and child mortality, with <strong>Somerset and Caroline Counties</strong> appearing in both age group rankings.</p>
<p><strong>Life expectancy varies by as much as seven years</strong> between some Eastern Shore counties and top-ranked Maryland jurisdictions. In a state known for world-class healthcare institutions, these disparities illustrate how excellence in Baltimore and Bethesda fails to reach the farms, fishing communities, and mountain towns that comprise rural Maryland.</p>
<h2 id="healthcare-infrastructure">Healthcare Infrastructure<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#healthcare-infrastructure">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>No Critical Access Hospitals</strong></p>
<p>Maryland is one of only <strong>five states with zero Critical Access Hospitals</strong>, alongside Connecticut, Delaware, New Jersey, and Rhode Island. The state does not participate in the Medicare Flex Program that supports CAH designation in other states. Maryland&rsquo;s unique all-payer hospital rate-setting system provides alternative mechanisms for rural hospital financial stability.</p>
<p>The state also has <strong>zero Rural Health Clinics</strong> and <strong>zero Rural Emergency Hospitals</strong> under federal designation criteria. This infrastructure absence reflects Maryland&rsquo;s regulatory structure rather than healthcare system weakness.</p>
<p><strong>Rural Hospital Network</strong></p>
<p>Despite lacking CAH designations, Maryland maintains functioning rural hospitals through its <strong>Health Services Cost Review Commission (HSCRC)</strong> regulatory framework:</p>

<p><strong>UM Shore Regional Health</strong> represents Maryland&rsquo;s primary rural hospital system, serving a <strong>2,000 square mile region</strong> across the mid-Eastern Shore. The system operates hospitals in Chestertown (Maryland&rsquo;s first designated Rural Hospital) and Easton, plus freestanding emergency centers in Chester and Denton. UM Shore is currently constructing a <strong>$540 million Shore Regional Medical Center</strong> in Easton, a six-story facility with 122 private inpatient beds, 27 emergency department treatment bays, and specialty services including an acute rehabilitation center, birthing center, and cardiac intervention unit.</p>
<p><strong>Federally Qualified Health Centers</strong></p>
<p>Maryland has <strong>32 FQHC sites</strong> operating outside Census-defined urban areas, providing primary care access to underserved populations. These centers serve as critical access points where private practice concentration is insufficient. FQHCs in rural Maryland operate on <strong>40%+ Medicaid dependence</strong> for patient revenue, making them particularly vulnerable to federal Medicaid coverage changes.</p>
<h2 id="the-maryland-model">The Maryland Model<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-maryland-model">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>All-Payer Rate Setting</strong></p>
<p>Maryland operates the <strong>only state-based all-payer hospital rate-setting system</strong> in the nation. Since the 1970s, the <strong>Health Services Cost Review Commission (HSCRC)</strong> has regulated hospital payment rates for all payers, including Medicare, Medicaid, commercial insurers, and self-pay patients. All payers pay the same rate for the same service at the same hospital.</p>
<p>This regulatory framework provides <strong>rural hospital financial stability</strong> unavailable to rural hospitals in other states. The system spreads uncompensated care costs across all payers rather than concentrating them on hospitals serving high proportions of uninsured patients. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Maryland hospitals avoided the massive revenue shortfalls that forced layoffs and service cuts elsewhere because <strong>global budget revenue</strong> maintained financial predictability regardless of volume fluctuations.</p>
<p><strong>Global Budget Revenue</strong></p>
<p>Under the all-payer model, each Maryland hospital receives a <strong>predetermined annual revenue amount</strong>. Payment rates adjust quarterly to ensure actual revenues match budgeted figures. This approach eliminates the volume incentive that drives unnecessary utilization elsewhere while protecting hospitals from financial volatility.</p>
<p>For rural hospitals specifically, global budgets ensure that <strong>seasonal fluctuations</strong> (particularly relevant for Eastern Shore tourism communities) and year-to-year demand variations do not threaten institutional viability. UM Shore Medical Center at Chestertown and similar facilities can plan staffing and services around predictable revenue rather than scrambling to manage volume-driven uncertainty.</p>
<p><strong>AHEAD Model Transition</strong></p>
<p>Maryland is transitioning from the Total Cost of Care (TCOC) Model to the <strong>AHEAD (Advancing All-Payer Health Equity Approaches and Development) Model</strong> beginning January 2026. This federal-state partnership extends the all-payer framework while adding population health accountability. The AHEAD model aligns with RHTP sustainability goals by providing the payment infrastructure that can maintain transformed care delivery beyond the 2030 funding sunset.</p>
<p>However, the Trump administration has signaled interest in <strong>altering the AHEAD agreement</strong>, specifically regarding Maryland&rsquo;s authority to set Medicare rates. If HSCRC authority is reduced or eliminated, hospitals may begin negotiating prices directly with insurers. Rural hospitals operating on thin margins could face significant financial strain. Governor Wes Moore created a <strong>regulatory working group</strong> to address AHEAD implementation alongside One Big Beautiful Bill Act implications.</p>

  </tbody>
</table>
<p>Each initiative divides funding between <strong>Immediate Impact</strong> (shovel-ready activities) and <strong>Transformation Funds</strong> (competitive, longer-term planning required).</p>
<p><strong>Workforce Transformation</strong></p>
<p>Maryland&rsquo;s workforce strategy addresses the cascade of shortages affecting rural communities:</p>
<p><strong>Immediate Impact Funding</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>New apprenticeships and expanded certificate programs for <strong>community health workers, nursing assistants, and peer recovery specialists</strong></li>
<li><strong>Area Health Education Center (AHEC)</strong> expansions connecting rural students with hands-on experience and clinical rotations in rural areas</li>
<li>Improved information technology for workforce development data tracking</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Transformation Funding</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pipeline programs for career exploration and upskilling opportunities</li>
<li><strong>Public health service corps</strong> modeled on successful loan repayment programs</li>
<li>Training, recruitment, and retention support for physicians and advanced practice professionals</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>University of Maryland School of Medicine</strong> launched its <strong>Rural-MD Scholars</strong> program in October 2024, funded by a $1.4 million state grant, aiming to eventually place 10 new physicians annually into Eastern Shore healthcare facilities. RHTP resources can accelerate and expand this pipeline approach.</p>
<p><strong>Sustainable Access and Innovative Care</strong></p>
<p><strong>Immediate Impact Funding</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>New and expanded capacity for rural primary care, specialty practices, and <strong>school-based health centers</strong></li>
<li>Improved efficiency of local agency care provision</li>
<li>Better-equipped trauma response</li>
<li>Expanded and optimized <strong>health information technology connectivity</strong></li>
<li>Infrastructure to spur broader telehealth adoption</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Transformation Funding</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sustainable access via expanded healthcare capacity and integrated technology</li>
<li><strong>Mobile health units</strong> in each rural region</li>
<li>Provider support for adoption of value-based, innovative care</li>
<li><strong>Behavioral health expansions</strong> across the full care continuum</li>
</ul>
<p>Mobile health represents a significant investment given documented challenges. Prior mobile clinic deployments in Maryland have closed due to cost-effectiveness concerns when utilization proved insufficient. The state&rsquo;s telehealth emphasis may prove more realistic given connectivity infrastructure already in place in many areas.</p>
<p><strong>Eat for Health</strong></p>
<p>Maryland&rsquo;s third initiative represents one of the most comprehensive <strong>Food is Medicine</strong> strategies in any RHTP application:</p>
<p><strong>Immediate Impact Funding</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Post-harvest infrastructure</strong> for small farms to supply local markets with fresh food</li>
<li>Increased healthy food access through support for grocers and mobile markets in hunger &ldquo;hot spots&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Nutrition education</strong> to create demand for healthy foods</li>
<li>Better regional planning and coordination for healthy food access</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Transformation Funding</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Food aggregators and food hubs</strong> to increase availability of affordable, local foods</li>
<li>New organizational purchasing strategies to pivot procurement toward healthy, local foods</li>
</ul>
<p>Maryland&rsquo;s agricultural heritage, particularly on the Eastern Shore, creates opportunity to connect <strong>local food production with rural health system nutrition programming</strong>. The &ldquo;Eat for Health&rdquo; initiative aligns with MAHA policy priorities while addressing documented food access challenges in rural communities where grocery store availability is limited and food insecurity rates exceed state averages.</p>

<p><strong>CRISP</strong>, Maryland&rsquo;s statewide health information exchange, provides interoperability infrastructure that many states lack. The platform enables referral coordination and information sharing across healthcare and community service providers, supporting RHTP initiatives requiring cross-sector collaboration.</p>

<p>Maryland expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, providing coverage to approximately <strong>1.5 million residents</strong> including significant rural populations. The state&rsquo;s <strong>Medicaid expansion</strong> created coverage infrastructure that RHTP initiatives assume as baseline.</p>
<p>However, federal Medicaid changes under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act create uncertainty:</p>

<p>RHTP cannot legally backfill Medicaid reductions, creating a structural mismatch between transformation funding and potential coverage erosion. Rural hospitals and FQHCs with high Medicaid dependence face fiscal pressure that care model innovation cannot fully resolve.</p>
<h2 id="implementation-assessment">Implementation Assessment<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#implementation-assessment">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
<p><strong>Regulatory Infrastructure</strong>: Maryland&rsquo;s all-payer hospital system provides financial stability infrastructure unavailable elsewhere. Rural hospitals do not face the closure risk that defines rural health crises in other states. HSCRC can adjust rates to support rural hospital sustainability within the regulatory framework.</p>
<p><strong>Health Information Exchange</strong>: CRISP provides operational statewide HIE infrastructure, reducing the technology development burden that many RHTP applications must address. The platform&rsquo;s existing capabilities enable social services integration, care coordination, and data analytics that support transformation initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>Academic Medical Center Partnership</strong>: UM Shore Regional Health&rsquo;s relationship with the University of Maryland System provides specialty access, residency training capacity, and clinical expertise that standalone rural systems lack. The Rural-MD Scholars program demonstrates institutional commitment to rural workforce development.</p>
<p><strong>Food System Assets</strong>: The Eastern Shore&rsquo;s agricultural economy, including significant produce, poultry, and seafood production, creates opportunity for Food is Medicine implementation that leverages local supply rather than importing intervention capacity.</p>
<p><strong>Vulnerabilities</strong></p>
<p><strong>Political Environment</strong>: Maryland&rsquo;s metropolitan-dominated policy environment may not sustain rural health focus when RHTP funds end. Legislative attention concentrates on Baltimore and suburban Washington corridor priorities where most voters reside.</p>
<p><strong>Mobile Health Economics</strong>: Prior mobile clinic closures due to insufficient utilization raise questions about mobile health strategy viability. The state&rsquo;s emphasis on mobile units assumes demand that experience has not consistently demonstrated.</p>
<p><strong>AHEAD Uncertainty</strong>: Federal administration interest in altering Maryland&rsquo;s rate-setting authority creates implementation risk. If HSCRC powers are reduced, the financial stability framework supporting rural hospitals could weaken precisely as RHTP investments are deployed.</p>
<p><strong>Limited Federal Rural Infrastructure</strong>: The absence of CAHs, REHs, and RHCs means Maryland lacks facilities operating under rural-specific federal payment frameworks. Strategies designed around these designations require adaptation to Maryland&rsquo;s regulatory context.</p>
<h2 id="sustainability-considerations">Sustainability Considerations<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#sustainability-considerations">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>The 2030 Question</strong></p>
<p>Maryland&rsquo;s sustainability strategy centers on leveraging the all-payer system and AHEAD transition to maintain transformed care delivery:</p>
<p><strong>Payment Model Alignment</strong>: Value-based payment initiatives through HSCRC create economic logic for sustaining RHTP innovations. If global budgets incentivize prevention, care coordination, and population health improvement, payment reforms maintain what RHTP resources establish.</p>
<p><strong>Infrastructure Investment</strong>: Many RHTP investments represent one-time capital costs (mobile units, telehealth equipment, post-harvest infrastructure) that create capacity sustained through subsequent service reimbursement and agricultural economics.</p>
<p><strong>Workforce Pipeline</strong>: Training programs create future providers who will practice for decades beyond the 2030 funding sunset. Each physician retained in rural Maryland represents 25-30 years of practice capacity from a five-year training investment.</p>
<p><strong>What Survives Partial Funding</strong></p>
<p>Given Maryland received approximately 17% of its request, prioritization will determine implementation scope:</p>
<p><strong>Likely Preserved</strong>: Workforce training and certification programs, AHEC expansion, telehealth infrastructure, CRISP enhancements, school-based health center expansion</p>
<p><strong>Uncertain</strong>: Full mobile health deployment across all rural regions, comprehensive Food is Medicine infrastructure, behavioral health expansion to full continuum</p>
<p><strong>At Risk</strong>: Some post-harvest agricultural infrastructure, complete food hub network, workforce recruitment incentives at requested levels</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>Maryland demonstrates that <strong>metropolitan state prominence does not eliminate rural health challenges</strong>. The Eastern Shore and Western Maryland face provider shortages, health disparities, and access barriers that mirror rural America&rsquo;s broader struggles despite the state&rsquo;s wealth, healthcare sophistication, and regulatory innovation.</p>
<p>The state&rsquo;s <strong>$168 million allocation</strong> enables meaningful investment calibrated to Maryland&rsquo;s unique conditions: an all-payer system that stabilizes rural hospital finances, academic medical center partnerships that extend specialty capacity, and agricultural assets that support Food is Medicine implementation.</p>
<p>Success depends on navigating <strong>AHEAD model uncertainty</strong>, sustaining rural health focus in metropolitan-dominated political environment, and demonstrating that mobile health and telehealth investments achieve access improvements that prior efforts have not consistently delivered. Maryland&rsquo;s experience will test whether <strong>regulatory innovation and existing infrastructure</strong> can accelerate transformation in states where rural populations constitute a minority of political attention but face majority-scale health disparities.</p>
<p>The fundamental question extends beyond Maryland: if a state with world-class healthcare institutions, unique payment regulatory authority, and substantial state fiscal capacity cannot address its own rural health disparities, what does that reveal about the structural nature of rural health challenges nationwide?</p>
