  "articleBody": "is_summary: true Rural Health Transformation Project Version 6: January 2026\nPurpose This document provides detailed state-by-state analysis of social care integration infrastructure under the Rural Health Transformation Program. Each state profile examines SDOH/HRSN status, CIE platform deployment, CHW program structure, and key gaps or strengths.\nRelated Documents:\n3-TD-E: Core inventory tables and status summaries GGH_CIE_Market_Assessment: Vendor competition and market opportunity analysis South Central/Western Priority Region (Batch 9) Regional Overview The South Central/Western Priority states (TX, OK, CA) present dramatically different social care infrastructure paradigms reflecting expansion status, state capacity, and philosophical orientation toward health transformation. Texas demonstrates mature CHW certification without sustainable Medicaid financing combined with fragmented regional CIE deployments despite having the nation’s largest rural population. Oklahoma presents an emerging opportunity with 2024 SPA approval creating CHW reimbursement against minimal CIE infrastructure. California operates in a fundamentally different paradigm where CalAIM’s comprehensive 1115 waiver supersedes traditional CIE models while CHW workforce development remains constrained by paused certification and inadequate reimbursement rates.\nKey Regional Patterns:\nNon-expansion states fragment social care: Texas and Oklahoma demonstrate MCO-driven approaches without state coordination infrastructure Scale creates market opportunity: Texas’s massive rural population (4.96M) creates platform opportunity despite fragmentation; no vendor has achieved statewide coordination CHW certification does not guarantee financing: Texas has 20+ year certification history but limited Medicaid reimbursement SPA development accelerating: Oklahoma’s 2024 SPA approval demonstrates national trend toward CHW Medicaid coverage CalAIM creates distinct market dynamics: California’s comprehensive transformation closes platform market; entry requires MCP partnership Tribal health creates parallel system: Oklahoma’s 39 federally recognized tribes operate CHR programs independently Texas: Highest South Central/Western CIE Opportunity Research Date: January 29, 2026 Overall Status: PARTIAL (CHW certified but underfinanced, CIE fragmented) Confidence: High\nRHTP Context\nMetric Value Year 1 Award $515,900,000 Rural Population ~4.96 million Per Capita ~$104/rural resident Lead Agency Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) Medicaid Status Non-expansion Coverage Gap 761,000+ residents Hospital Risk 77 hospitals at elevated risk Texas holds the largest rural population of any state and the largest population in the coverage gap, creating extreme SDOH burden that RHTP cannot address without expansion. The scale penalty in per-capita funding ($104) compared to smaller states reflects formula structures rewarding geographic sparsity over population size.\nCIE Platform Status: FRAGMENTED REGIONAL\nFactor Status Statewide Platform None Findhelp Presence Yes (11 hospital systems, 8 health centers, Superior Health Plan MCO) Unite Us Presence Yes (UMC Lubbock/South Plains Food Bank partnership) Closed-Loop Referrals Regional only; no statewide interoperability RHTP Investment Not explicitly included What Exists:\nFindhelp Deployments:\n11 hospital systems using platform for social needs screening and referral 8 federally qualified health centers with active deployments Superior Health Plan (Medicaid MCO) enterprise contract ConnectATX Navigator Model: United Way Greater Austin partnership combines Findhelp platform with trained navigators Statewide hospital system uptake but fragmented implementation Unite Us Deployments:\nUMC Lubbock partnership with South Plains Food Bank for regional coordination Limited presence compared to Findhelp in major metro areas No statewide network identified Central Texas Model Community:\nAustin-area integration combining Findhelp + Texas 211 + Connxus HIE + Dell Medical SHIP platform Multi-platform coordination pilot without statewide replication 211 Texas:\nUnited Way-operated statewide resource directory Information and referral capability No closed-loop functionality CHCS May 2025 Report Findings:\nDocumented fragmented landscape requiring interoperability standards Multiple platforms serving same geographies without data exchange MCO-specific tools creating additional fragmentation CHW Program Status: MATURE CERTIFICATION / LIMITED MEDICAID\nFactor Status State Certification Yes (Mandatory since 2001) Certifying Body Texas DSHS CHW Training \u0026 Certification Program Training Requirements 160-hour training OR 1,000 hours experience (past 3 years) Training Programs 49 certified programs (community colleges, AHECs, FQHCs, CBOs) Medicaid Reimbursement Limited Certification Framework:\nTexas Health and Safety Code Chapter 48 (effective 2001) establishes mandatory certification for compensated CHWs:\nNo person may hold themselves out as a CHW or promotora for compensation without DSHS certification Among the earliest and most comprehensive state certification requirements nationally 49 approved training programs distributed across the state Workforce estimated at 89% female with strong promotora tradition Medicaid Reimbursement Limitations:\nTexas lacks comprehensive SPA for CHW services. Limited coverage exists through targeted legislation:\nHB 113 (2023):\nAllows Medicaid MCOs to categorize CHW expenditures as quality improvement costs Does not establish direct service reimbursement Value-added benefit rather than covered service HB 1575 (2023):\nEstablishes CHW as separate provider type in Medicaid Limited to Case Management for Children \u0026 Pregnant Women Program only Does not extend to general population No Comprehensive SPA:\nTexas has not submitted comprehensive State Plan Amendment for general CHW services coverage MCO contracts may include CHW services as value-added benefits at plan discretion No fee-for-service pathway for most CHW services Significance: Texas demonstrates a paradox where mature workforce infrastructure coexists with limited financing sustainability. The 49 training programs produce certified CHWs without clear Medicaid pathway for most services.\nSDOH/HRSN Status: FRAGMENTED / AT RISK\nFactor Status Screening MCO-specific, not mandated statewide Navigation MCO-driven through individual plan contracts Integration Model MCO-fragmented without state coordination 1115 Waiver Yes (Texas Healthcare Transformation) through 2030, no HRSN services Key Limitation: CMS rescinded HRSN guidance in March 2025. Texas did not apply for HRSN services waiver under Biden-era framework. Current 1115 waiver focuses on managed care authority and maintaining uncompensated care pool rather than SDOH integration.\nSurvival Assessment: Social care components face high vulnerability given non-expansion status, lack of 1115 HRSN authority, and RHTP application emphasis on clinical infrastructure.\nTD-E Classification: Partial (CHW certified but underfinanced, CIE fragmented)\nGGH Strategic Assessment:\nCIE Gap: MODERATE-HIGH (fragmented regional without statewide coordination) Market Priority: MODERATE-HIGH Entry Points: Texas Hospital Association, Texas Association of Community Health Centers, Texas DSHS CHW Program Office, Superior Health Plan, East Texas regional health systems Target Geography: East Texas Region (Smith, Gregg, Harrison, Cherokee, Nacogdoches, Angelina, Rusk counties) Offering: Platform + Services (Regional CIE deployment with CHW integration leveraging existing certified workforce, advocacy for comprehensive SPA) Oklahoma: Emerging CHW Opportunity with Minimal CIE Research Date: January 29, 2026 Overall Status: EMERGING (CHW financed, CIE minimal) Confidence: Medium-High\nRHTP Context\nMetric Value Year 1 Award $195,400,000 Rural Population ~525,000 Per Capita ~$372/rural resident Lead Agency Oklahoma State Department of Health (OSDH) Medicaid Status Non-expansion Coverage Gap ~90,000 residents Tribal Health 39 federally recognized tribes with distinct health systems Oklahoma demonstrates higher per-capita RHTP allocation than Texas due to smaller rural population, but faces implementation challenges from recent Medicaid managed care transition and significant tribal health complexity.\nCIE Platform Status: LIMITED PRESENCE\nFactor Status Statewide Platform None identified Findhelp Presence No statewide deployment documented Unite Us Presence “Unite Oklahoma” network exists; scale unclear Closed-Loop Referrals Limited or none RHTP Investment Unknown What Exists:\nUnite Oklahoma Network:\nNetwork page exists (uniteus.com/networks/oklahoma/) Specific coverage area, participating organizations, and utilization metrics not publicly documented Appears limited compared to mature Unite Us deployments in other states 211 Oklahoma:\nStandard 211 resource and referral service No closed-loop referral capability Tribal Health Systems:\nIndian Health Service and tribal health programs operate independently Community Health Representatives (CHRs) provide similar services to CHWs through tribal systems Not integrated with state CIE infrastructure CHW Program Status: EMERGING / SPA APPROVED\nFactor Status State Certification No (Uses C3 Core Competencies as framework) Certifying Body None; C3 training accepted Training Providers OK State Dept of Health, Tulsa City-County Health, OKC-County Health, OSU Medicaid Reimbursement Yes (SPA Approved 2024) Dedicated State Office Yes (NASHP 2024-2025 tracker confirms) SPA Approval Details:\nNASHP confirms Oklahoma among four states receiving CMS SPA approval in 2024 (alongside Colorado, Georgia, Washington):\nReimbursement pathway established for CHW services through Medicaid Requirements: C3 training certificate OR 2,000 hours documented experience Service setting: Must work at public health clinic; services ordered by physician/licensed practitioner No statewide certification requirement MCO Activity:\nOklahoma Complete Health offers CHW home visits for pediatric asthma management Implemented as value-added service through managed care contract Demonstrates MCO interest in CHW services Tribal Health Workers:\nCommunity Health Representatives (CHRs) operate through tribal programs Distinct from state CHW certification/reimbursement framework Long history of community-based care within tribal systems Not integrated with state Medicaid SPA framework Significance: Oklahoma’s 2024 SPA approval without certification requirement creates lower barrier to CHW service delivery while establishing Medicaid financing pathway.\nSDOH/HRSN Status: LIMITED / AT RISK\nFactor Status Screening Not mandated statewide Navigation Limited; managed care transition ongoing Integration Model Emerging through managed care contracts 1115 Waiver Limited (managed care transition focus), no HRSN services Survival Assessment: SDOH components face moderate-high vulnerability given non-expansion status, lack of 1115 HRSN authority, and ongoing managed care transition creating competing priorities. CHW services have established financing pathway through SPA.\nTD-E Classification: Emerging (CHW financed, CIE minimal)\nGGH Strategic Assessment:\nCIE Gap: MODERATE (near-greenfield with Unite Oklahoma limited presence) Market Priority: MODERATE Entry Points: Oklahoma State Department of Health, Oklahoma Hospital Association, Oklahoma Primary Care Association, Oklahoma Complete Health (MCO with CHW interest), tribal health programs (distinct approach required) Target Geography: Rural Eastern Oklahoma (Cherokee, Creek, Adair, Muskogee counties) Offering: Platform + Services (CIE deployment combined with CHW services leveraging new SPA; tribal partnerships as separate track) Challenges: Tribal CHR programs operate independently; managed care transition creates implementation competing priorities California: CalAIM Saturation Closes Platform Market Research Date: January 29, 2026 Overall Status: FUNDED (CalAIM comprehensive, but certification paused, rural gaps) Confidence: High\nRHTP Context\nMetric Value Year 1 Award $625,500,000 Rural Population ~4.63 million Per Capita ~$135/rural resident Lead Agency California Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) Medicaid Status Expansion CalAIM Status Active 1115 demonstration through 2026 Unique Complexity CalAIM supersedes traditional CIE model California operates in a fundamentally different paradigm from Texas and Oklahoma. CalAIM (California Advancing and Innovating Medi-Cal) represents the nation’s most comprehensive Medicaid transformation, creating MCP-integrated social care delivery that supersedes traditional CIE platform approaches.\nCIE Platform Status: CALAIM SUPERSEDES\nFactor Status Statewide Platform N/A (CalAIM/MCP-integrated) Findhelp Presence Regional only; superseded by CalAIM Unite Us Presence Regional only; superseded by CalAIM Integration Model MCP-mandatory RHTP Investment Supplements existing CalAIM infrastructure CalAIM Framework:\nCommunity Supports (14 Services):\nHousing transition navigation services Housing deposits Housing tenancy and sustaining services Short-term post-hospitalization housing Recuperative care (medical respite) Respite services Day habilitation programs Nursing facility transition/diversion to assisted living Community transition services/nursing facility transition Personal care and homemaker services Environmental accessibility adaptations (home modifications) Medically supportive food/nutrition services Sobering centers Asthma remediation Enhanced Care Management (ECM):\nIntensive care coordination for high-need populations Populations of focus: experiencing homelessness, high utilizers, serious mental illness, pregnant/postpartum Lead Care Manager model with comprehensive assessment MCP-contracted providers deliver services Data Exchange Framework (DxF):\nState-mandated interoperability framework (effective January 2024) Requires health and social service data exchange across organizations Creates state-level coordination infrastructure Implementation Reality:\nCHCF 2024 Survey Findings:\nLower utilization than expected across ECM and Community Supports ECM enrollment: 0.9% of eligible population Community Supports enrollment: 0.9% of eligible population MCP variation in eligibility criteria and implementation Administrative burden cited as significant barrier Rural Implementation Gaps:\nLower uptake in rural areas than urban CBO capacity constraints limit Community Supports delivery PATH Funding ($1.84 billion) targets rural and historically under-resourced areas Standardization efforts underway (DHCS 2024-2025 action plan) Significance: California’s CIE market is effectively closed for platform competition. MCPs serve as the integration mechanism; standalone CIE vendors must work through or alongside MCP infrastructure.\nCHW Program Status: BENEFIT LIVE / CERTIFICATION PAUSED\nFactor Status State Certification Paused Indefinitely (November 2023) Certifying Body HCAI (development paused) Medi-Cal Benefit Yes (Effective July 2022) Billing Codes CPT 98960-98962, Medicare G-codes (CHI/PIN) Reimbursement Rate $27.54/30 min (2024) to $31.74/30 min (2025) Medi-Cal CHW/P/R Benefit:\nThe Community Health Worker/Promotora/Representative (CHW/P/R) benefit became effective July 2022:\nReimbursable through CPT codes 98960-98962 and Medicare G-codes Rate increase in 2025: $31.74 per 30 minutes (100% of Medicare RVUs) Services must be under written recommendation from licensed provider Plan of care required for services exceeding 6 hours Supervising Provider Types:\nPhysicians, nurse practitioners, licensed clinical social workers Pharmacists, mental health practitioners CBOs and Local Health Jurisdictions (LHJs) added January 2024 Certification Pause:\nNovember 2023: HCAI paused certification guidance following stakeholder concerns:\nFeedback that stakeholders had not been adequately engaged Concerns that proposed requirements not fit-for-purpose Guidance paused indefinitely pending additional engagement 2024 Community Dialogues:\nCalHHS, HCAI, and DHCS conducted second engagement round 680+ CHW/P/Rs participated across 23 sessions hosted by 20 organizations Re-examined workforce needs and certification approach Advisory Workgroup established December 2024 (majority active CHW/P/Rs) Sustainability Challenges:\nRate Insufficiency:\n$31.74/30 min cited as insufficient for CBO sustainability Administrative burden exceeds reimbursement value for many providers CBOs struggle to maintain CHW programs on Medi-Cal reimbursement alone Budget Cuts:\n2024 Budget Act eliminated most HCAI CHW/P/R funding Limited state investment in workforce development Certification development constrained by funding limitations Significance: California paradox where benefit exists but sustainability mechanisms remain incomplete. Certification pause and inadequate rates limit workforce growth despite policy framework supporting CHW services.\nSDOH/HRSN Status: FUNDED (CALAIM)\nFactor Status Screening MCP-mandated through CalAIM Navigation ECM Lead Care Manager model Integration Model MCP-integrated with Community Supports benefit 1115 Waiver Yes (CalAIM) through December 2026, 14 Community Supports services Investment Level Billions through MCP contracts + IPP + PATH Funding Mechanisms:\nIncentive Payment Program (IPP): Performance payments to MCPs for ECM/Community Supports implementation Provider Assistance for Transition to Health (PATH): $1.84 billion for providers serving rural/under-resourced areas MCP Contract Requirements: MCPs required to offer ECM and Community Supports; investment built into rates Survival Assessment: CalAIM represents most sustainable SDOH model nationally with waiver authority, MCP integration, and significant state investment. However, rural implementation gaps create service delivery opportunities distinct from platform opportunities.\nTD-E Classification: Funded (CalAIM comprehensive, but certification paused, rural gaps)\nGGH Strategic Assessment:\nCIE Gap: LOW (CalAIM/MCP saturation) Market Priority: LOW Limited Opportunities: Rural Community Supports service delivery where CBO capacity insufficient; CHW services in rural areas with low ECM/Community Supports uptake Not Recommended: Platform deployment (CalAIM/MCP infrastructure supersedes), statewide market entry (regulatory complexity), CHW workforce development (certification paused, funding eliminated) If Pursued Entry Points: California Primary Care Association (rural FQHC needs), Central Valley MCPs (documented implementation challenges), PATH-funded providers seeking implementation support Target Geography: If pursued, Central Valley or Northern California rural counties with lowest CalAIM uptake South Central/Western Region Summary State CIE Platform CHW Status HRSN/SDOH TD-E Status GGH CIE Gap TX Fragmented Regional (Findhelp/Unite Us) Mandatory cert (DSHS, 49 programs), limited Medicaid MCO-fragmented Partial MODERATE-HIGH OK Limited (Unite Oklahoma) No cert, 2024 SPA approved Emerging MCO Emerging MODERATE CA CalAIM/MCP-integrated Paused cert, Medi-Cal benefit active Funded (CalAIM) Funded LOW Deep South Priority Region (Batch 7) Regional Overview The Deep South Priority states (MS, TN, GA, NC) present dramatically differentiated social care infrastructure maturity spanning from North Carolina’s nation-leading CIE deployment (NCCARE360 statewide) to Georgia’s complete absence of social care strategy in its RHTP application. The region divides into two distinct categories: states with established CIE infrastructure (TN, NC) showing mature platform deployments with MCO integration, and states without CIE infrastructure (MS, GA) demonstrating that non-expansion status correlates with social care deprioritization.\nKey Regional Patterns:\nNon-expansion states deprioritize social care: Mississippi and Georgia RHTP applications emphasize clinical infrastructure over SDOH/CIE investment Binary CIE market structure: Tennessee and North Carolina have mature statewide platforms; Mississippi and Georgia have none CHW legislation creates sustainability pathway: Mississippi’s HB 1401 (2025) creates mandatory certification and directs Medicaid SPA development Platform maturity determines entry strategy: Mature platforms (TN, NC) require services approach; greenfield markets (MS, GA) require platform deployment Black Belt/Delta geography spans multiple states: Creating cross-state regional approach opportunity Mississippi: Highest Deep South CIE Opportunity Research Date: January 29, 2026 Overall Status: PARTIAL (CHW emerging, no CIE) Confidence: High\nRHTP Context\nMetric Value Year 1 Award $205,907,220 Rural Population ~2.1 million Per Capita ~$98/rural resident Lead Agency Office of the Governor (MS Department of Health implementing) Medicaid Status Non-expansion Coverage Gap 100,000+ residents Hospital Risk 54% of rural hospitals vulnerable (highest nationally) CIE Platform Status: NONE IDENTIFIED\nFactor Status Statewide Platform None Unite Us Presence No network identified Findhelp Presence No statewide deployment Closed-Loop Referrals None integrated with clinical care RHTP Investment Not explicitly included What Exists:\nDelta Health Alliance: Regional coordination in Delta counties providing health education, care coordination, and community outreach without closed-loop technology 211 Services: United Way-operated resource directory without closed-loop capability CRIS Regional Networks (Proposed): Mississippi’s RHTP centerpiece creates regional coordination hubs, but initial focus is clinical infrastructure rather than social care referral systems CHW Program Status: EMERGING / LEGISLATED\nFactor Status State Certification Yes (HB 1401, effective January 1, 2026) Certifying Body Mississippi State Department of Health (MSDH) Medicaid Reimbursement Pending (HB 1401 directs SPA/waiver development) Training Programs Aaron E.

The region demonstrates that expansion status alone does not guarantee CIE development. All three states show preference for regional hub models over centralized systems, creating federated platform opportunities.\nKey Regional Patterns:\nExpansion states lack statewide CIE: Ohio, Kentucky, and West Virginia all expanded Medicaid but have no statewide CIE coordination Robust CHW infrastructure without sustainable financing: MCO-mediated reimbursement limited to maternal/SUD populations Regional hub preference: Ohio Pathways HUBs, Kentucky Homeplace demonstrate regional rather than centralized approach Opioid crisis creates SUD-social care nexus: Providing reimbursement

<h3 id="regional-overview">Regional Overview<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#regional-overview">#</a></h3>
<p>The South Central/Western Priority states (TX, OK, CA) present <strong>dramatically different social care infrastructure paradigms</strong> reflecting expansion status, state capacity, and philosophical orientation toward health transformation. Texas demonstrates <strong>mature CHW certification without sustainable Medicaid financing</strong> combined with <strong>fragmented regional CIE deployments</strong> despite having the nation&rsquo;s largest rural population. Oklahoma presents an emerging opportunity with <strong>2024 SPA approval creating CHW reimbursement</strong> against minimal CIE infrastructure. California operates in a <strong>fundamentally different paradigm</strong> where CalAIM&rsquo;s comprehensive 1115 waiver supersedes traditional CIE models while CHW workforce development remains constrained by paused certification and inadequate reimbursement rates.</p>
<p><strong>Key Regional Patterns:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Non-expansion states fragment social care:</strong> Texas and Oklahoma demonstrate MCO-driven approaches without state coordination infrastructure</li>
<li><strong>Scale creates market opportunity:</strong> Texas&rsquo;s massive rural population (4.96M) creates platform opportunity despite fragmentation; no vendor has achieved statewide coordination</li>
<li><strong>CHW certification does not guarantee financing:</strong> Texas has 20+ year certification history but limited Medicaid reimbursement</li>
<li><strong>SPA development accelerating:</strong> Oklahoma&rsquo;s 2024 SPA approval demonstrates national trend toward CHW Medicaid coverage</li>
<li><strong>CalAIM creates distinct market dynamics:</strong> California&rsquo;s comprehensive transformation closes platform market; entry requires MCP partnership</li>
<li><strong>Tribal health creates parallel system:</strong> Oklahoma&rsquo;s 39 federally recognized tribes operate CHR programs independently</li>

<p>Texas holds the <strong>largest rural population of any state</strong> and the <strong>largest population in the coverage gap</strong>, creating extreme SDOH burden that RHTP cannot address without expansion. The scale penalty in per-capita funding ($104) compared to smaller states reflects formula structures rewarding geographic sparsity over population size.</p>

<p><strong>Certification Framework:</strong></p>
<p>Texas Health and Safety Code Chapter 48 (effective 2001) establishes <strong>mandatory certification</strong> for compensated CHWs:</p>
<ul>
<li>No person may hold themselves out as a CHW or promotora for compensation without DSHS certification</li>
<li>Among the earliest and most comprehensive state certification requirements nationally</li>
<li><strong>49 approved training programs</strong> distributed across the state</li>
<li>Workforce estimated at 89% female with strong promotora tradition</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Medicaid Reimbursement Limitations:</strong></p>
<p>Texas lacks comprehensive SPA for CHW services. Limited coverage exists through targeted legislation:</p>
<p><strong>HB 113 (2023):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Allows Medicaid MCOs to categorize CHW expenditures as quality improvement costs</li>
<li>Does <strong>not</strong> establish direct service reimbursement</li>
<li>Value-added benefit rather than covered service</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>HB 1575 (2023):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Establishes CHW as separate provider type in Medicaid</li>
<li>Limited to <strong>Case Management for Children &amp; Pregnant Women Program only</strong></li>
<li>Does not extend to general population</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>No Comprehensive SPA:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Texas has not submitted comprehensive State Plan Amendment for general CHW services coverage</li>
<li>MCO contracts may include CHW services as value-added benefits at plan discretion</li>
<li>No fee-for-service pathway for most CHW services</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Significance:</strong> Texas demonstrates a paradox where <strong>mature workforce infrastructure</strong> coexists with <strong>limited financing sustainability</strong>. The 49 training programs produce certified CHWs without clear Medicaid pathway for most services.</p>

<p><strong>Key Limitation:</strong> CMS rescinded HRSN guidance in March 2025. Texas did not apply for HRSN services waiver under Biden-era framework. Current 1115 waiver focuses on managed care authority and maintaining uncompensated care pool rather than SDOH integration.</p>
<p><strong>Survival Assessment:</strong> Social care components face <strong>high vulnerability</strong> given non-expansion status, lack of 1115 HRSN authority, and RHTP application emphasis on clinical infrastructure.</p>

<li>Lower utilization than expected across ECM and Community Supports</li>
<li>ECM enrollment: 0.9% of eligible population</li>
<li>Community Supports enrollment: 0.9% of eligible population</li>
<li>MCP variation in eligibility criteria and implementation</li>
<li>Administrative burden cited as significant barrier</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rural Implementation Gaps:</strong></p>

<li>Physicians, nurse practitioners, licensed clinical social workers</li>
<li>Pharmacists, mental health practitioners</li>
<li><strong>CBOs and Local Health Jurisdictions (LHJs) added January 2024</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Certification Pause:</strong></p>
<p>November 2023: HCAI paused certification guidance following stakeholder concerns:</p>
<ul>
<li>Feedback that stakeholders had not been adequately engaged</li>
<li>Concerns that proposed requirements not fit-for-purpose</li>
<li>Guidance paused indefinitely pending additional engagement</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2024 Community Dialogues:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>CalHHS, HCAI, and DHCS conducted second engagement round</li>
<li>680+ CHW/P/Rs participated across 23 sessions hosted by 20 organizations</li>
<li>Re-examined workforce needs and certification approach</li>
<li>Advisory Workgroup established December 2024 (majority active CHW/P/Rs)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sustainability Challenges:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rate Insufficiency:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>$31.74/30 min cited as insufficient for CBO sustainability</li>
<li>Administrative burden exceeds reimbursement value for many providers</li>
<li>CBOs struggle to maintain CHW programs on Medi-Cal reimbursement alone</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Budget Cuts:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2024 Budget Act eliminated most HCAI CHW/P/R funding</li>
<li>Limited state investment in workforce development</li>
<li>Certification development constrained by funding limitations</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Significance:</strong> California paradox where <strong>benefit exists but sustainability mechanisms remain incomplete</strong>. Certification pause and inadequate rates limit workforce growth despite policy framework supporting CHW services.</p>

<h3 id="regional-overview-1">Regional Overview<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#regional-overview-1">#</a></h3>
<p>The Deep South Priority states (MS, TN, GA, NC) present <strong>dramatically differentiated social care infrastructure maturity</strong> spanning from North Carolina&rsquo;s nation-leading CIE deployment (NCCARE360 statewide) to Georgia&rsquo;s complete absence of social care strategy in its RHTP application. The region divides into two distinct categories: states with established CIE infrastructure (TN, NC) showing mature platform deployments with MCO integration, and states without CIE infrastructure (MS, GA) demonstrating that <strong>non-expansion status correlates with social care deprioritization</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Key Regional Patterns:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Non-expansion states deprioritize social care:</strong> Mississippi and Georgia RHTP applications emphasize clinical infrastructure over SDOH/CIE investment</li>
<li><strong>Binary CIE market structure:</strong> Tennessee and North Carolina have mature statewide platforms; Mississippi and Georgia have none</li>
<li><strong>CHW legislation creates sustainability pathway:</strong> Mississippi&rsquo;s HB 1401 (2025) creates mandatory certification and directs Medicaid SPA development</li>
<li><strong>Platform maturity determines entry strategy:</strong> Mature platforms (TN, NC) require services approach; greenfield markets (MS, GA) require platform deployment</li>
<li><strong>Black Belt/Delta geography spans multiple states:</strong> Creating cross-state regional approach opportunity</li>

<p>The Appalachian Priority states (OH, KY, WV) share <strong>robust CHW infrastructure without statewide CIE platforms</strong> despite having three expansion states with active care coordination programs. The region demonstrates that <strong>expansion status alone does not guarantee CIE development</strong>. All three states show preference for regional hub models over centralized systems, creating federated platform opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>Key Regional Patterns:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Expansion states lack statewide CIE:</strong> Ohio, Kentucky, and West Virginia all expanded Medicaid but have no statewide CIE coordination</li>
<li><strong>Robust CHW infrastructure without sustainable financing:</strong> MCO-mediated reimbursement limited to maternal/SUD populations</li>
<li><strong>Regional hub preference:</strong> Ohio Pathways HUBs, Kentucky Homeplace demonstrate regional rather than centralized approach</li>
<li><strong>Opioid crisis creates SUD-social care nexus:</strong> Providing reimbursement pathway for CHW services addressing substance use</li>
<li><strong>Gap is platform infrastructure, not workforce or program design</strong></li>
