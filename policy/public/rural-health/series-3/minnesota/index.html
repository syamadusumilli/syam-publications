  "articleBody": "Minnesota received $193 million in FY2026 RHTP funding, positioning the state slightly below the national average of $200 million despite operating one of the nation’s most extensive Critical Access Hospital networks. The Minnesota Department of Health submitted an application requesting $1 billion over five years, reflecting comprehensive stakeholder engagement through more than 40 meetings and nearly 350 public responses. The resulting award represents a 3.5% reduction from the average requested annual allocation.\nThe state’s strategic approach centers on cardiometabolic disease management, workforce pipeline development, and technology-enabled care delivery. Minnesota’s application builds on established infrastructure including the Minnesota 2035 Plan on Cardiovascular Health and Diabetes, positioning RHTP as an acceleration mechanism for existing priorities rather than creation of entirely new systems.\nRural Health Landscape State Context Minnesota spans 86,936 square miles across 87 counties, with approximately 1.26 million residents (22.1% of the population) living in nonmetropolitan areas according to 2023 Census data. The state’s rural character concentrates in northern and western regions while the seven-county Twin Cities metropolitan area contains over 60% of the total population and continues to grow faster than rural counterparts.\nMetric Value Total Population 5.71 million Rural Population ~1.26 million Percentage Nonmetro 22.1% Total Counties 87 Entirely Rural Counties 14 Town/Rural Mix Counties 35 Minnesota’s State Demographic Center classifies counties using Rural-Urban Commuting Area codes rather than simple population thresholds. Under this framework, 14 counties qualify as entirely rural, 35 as town/rural mix, 25 as urban/town/rural mix, and only 13 as entirely urban. This nuanced classification reveals that rural character extends well beyond the 14 most isolated counties.\nPopulation trends present a complex picture. While the most rural counties experienced steady decline during the 2010s, the early 2020s brought modest population gains from domestic migration. However, long-term projections suggest this reversal cannot be sustained. Rural Minnesota’s aging population produces more deaths than births, creating negative natural change that in-migration cannot fully offset. The state projects population growth from 5.78 million in 2024 to 6.11 million by 2075, but this growth concentrates almost entirely in metropolitan areas.\nMinnesota is home to 11 sovereign Tribal Nations, including seven Anishinaabe (Chippewa, Ojibwe) reservations and four Dakota (Sioux) communities. Ten of these nations are located in rural areas, creating distinct healthcare delivery challenges that include Indian Health Service coordination, cultural competency requirements, and sovereign governance considerations.\nHealthcare Infrastructure Minnesota maintains one of the nation’s most extensive Critical Access Hospital networks:\nFacility Type Count Notes Critical Access Hospitals 76 Third highest nationally Rural Emergency Hospitals 1 New REH designation Rural Health Clinics 107 Primary care access points FQHCs 20 Safety net providers Community Hospitals (Total) 125 Including urban facilities Rural Hospitals 90 Located outside metro areas The 76 Critical Access Hospitals rank Minnesota third nationally behind Texas (82) and Kansas. Of these, one is an Indian Health Service facility not counted among community hospitals. The Minnesota Hospital Association reports 78 CAH-designated facilities when including recent conversions, though the official MDH count remains 76.\nEleven Minnesota CAHs received recognition in the 2025 Chartis Top 100 Critical Access Hospitals list, demonstrating quality performance alongside network density. Recognized facilities include Aspirus Lake View Hospital in Two Harbors, which achieved Top 100 status for the second consecutive year. The ranking evaluates market share, quality, outcomes, patient perspective, cost, charge, and financial performance.\nMinnesota’s Flex Program supports all CAHs through quality improvement activities administered by Stratis Health, the state’s designated technical assistance provider. Stratis Health operates the Medicare Beneficiary Quality Improvement Project (MBQIP), hosts monthly open calls for CAH staff, and developed a Social Drivers of Health Toolkit specifically for CAHs and their community partners.\nHospital service availability has declined over the past decade. Between 2013 and 2023, rural hospitals lost inpatient and outpatient surgery capacity, detoxification services, CT and MRI availability, PET services, organ transplant capability, and renal dialysis. Much of this loss occurred through service line elimination rather than hospital closure, though the cumulative effect reduces care available in rural communities.\nHealth Professional Shortages Minnesota’s workforce challenges mirror national patterns while reflecting the state’s distinctive educational infrastructure:\nCategory Status Primary Care HPSAs Multiple designation areas Population in HPSA ~60% of state population Nursing Share of Workforce Largest licensed provider category Physician Distribution Concentrated in metro areas The state’s Rural Emergency Medical Services workforce is in crisis, according to MDH data. Expired EMS certifications increasingly outpace new certifications issued, creating a gap that threatens emergency response capacity in areas where transport times to hospitals already extend 30 minutes or longer.\nMinnesota ranks in the bottom 20% nationally for general pediatricians per 100,000 children. Developmental specialists who assess and treat children with Autism Spectrum Disorder and serious emotional disorders face multi-month waiting lists that rural families cannot easily navigate given distance constraints.\nThe University of Minnesota Rural Physician Associate Program (RPAP) represents a distinctive state asset. This program places medical students in rural communities for extended clinical training, building both skills and relationships that increase rural practice likelihood after graduation. RPAP graduates practice in rural Minnesota at rates substantially higher than medical school graduates without rural training exposure.\nEconomic and Social Context Minnesota’s economic position distinguishes it from many states seeking RHTP funding. The state’s median household income of $90,340 (2023) approaches the national high end. Unemployment consistently runs below national averages. The seven-county metro area drives substantial economic growth while Greater Minnesota maintains relative stability through agriculture, manufacturing, and regional service centers.\nYet aggregate prosperity masks rural disparities. Approximately 105,000 people live in concentrated poverty areas in rural Minnesota. Urban areas show 9.1% poverty rates compared to 11.8% in large rural cities and 10.7% in small town rural areas. Agricultural employment, while economically productive, carries occupational hazards including chemical exposure and machinery accidents.\nRHTP Award and Context Metric Minnesota National Average FY2026 Award $193 million $200 million Five-Year Request $1 billion Varies Five-Year Projected ~$965 million ~$1 billion Rural Population ~1.26 million Varies Per-Capita (Rural) ~$153 ~$150 CAH Count 76 28 average Minnesota’s below-average award reflects the formula’s interaction with state characteristics. The 22.1% rural population share ranks lower than states receiving larger awards, though the absolute rural population of 1.26 million exceeds many competitors. The 76 CAHs generate scoring weight, but states with more extreme rurality metrics (Montana, Wyoming, Alaska) received higher per-capita allocations.\nFormula Position Minnesota’s award breaks down approximately as follows:\n50% equal distribution: ~$100 million baseline 50% workload factors: ~$93 million based on rurality metrics and application scoring The $93 million workload allocation positions Minnesota slightly below median, suggesting the application scored competitively but the state’s rurality metrics did not maximize available points. States with larger proportions of population in rural census tracts, higher shares of rural health facilities relative to national totals, and more extreme frontier characteristics captured larger workload allocations.\nMedicaid Context Minnesota expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act and operates one of the nation’s most comprehensive public coverage systems:\nProgram Enrollment Coverage Level Medical Assistance ~1.16 million Up to 138% FPL Expansion Population ~219,000 Adults without children MinnesotaCare ~101,000 138% to 200% FPL Total Public Coverage ~1.3 million 22% of state population Minnesota’s uninsured rate stands at an all-time low of 3.8% in 2025, reflecting the combined effect of Medical Assistance, MinnesotaCare (the state’s Basic Health Program), and MNsure marketplace coverage. This coverage foundation provides RHTP initiatives with insured populations who can access transformed services.\nHowever, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act threatens this foundation. The Minnesota Department of Human Services estimates federal Medicaid changes could result in coverage loss for up to 140,000 Minnesotans through work requirements, six-month eligibility redeterminations, immigration status restrictions, and provider payment limits. The Minnesota Medical Association projects hospitals could lose roughly $1 billion annually from state-directed payment limitations once fully implemented.\nMinnesotaCare faces particular uncertainty. The program depends on federal Basic Health Program funding, which may become unavailable due to legislation changes. Monthly premiums, currently capped at $28, will rise to $80 in 2026 if enhanced ACA subsidies expire as scheduled.\nState Approach Governance and Lead Agency The Minnesota Department of Health serves as Governor Tim Walz’s designated lead agency for RHTP implementation. MDH’s Office of Rural Health and Primary Care (ORHPC) administers the program, building on existing relationships with CAHs, rural health clinics, and community partners developed through the Flex Program and other federal grants.\nMDH established robust stakeholder engagement during application development:\n40+ stakeholder meetings across Minnesota Nearly 350 public responses to input requests Letters of support from bipartisan state and federal lawmakers Endorsements from Minnesota Hospital Association, Association of Minnesota Counties, Minnesota Medical Association, Minnesota Association of Community Health Centers, and Minnesota Office of Emergency Medical Services Commissioner of Health Dr. Brooke Cunningham positioned the application as responsive to “the real needs of Greater Minnesota,” emphasizing technology tools that enable care delivery closer to patients’ homes.\nStrategic Framework Minnesota’s RHTP strategy organizes around five interconnected goals that align with CMS statutory priorities:\nGoal 1: Improve Cardiometabolic Health Outcomes Focus on cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease prevention and management among rural Minnesotans at risk or already diagnosed.\nGoal 2: Build Workforce Pipelines Create education pathways and promote training opportunities to sustainably expand the healthcare workforce in rural areas.\nGoal 3: Expand Access Through Technology Deploy new entry points for community-based screenings, preventive care, and chronic disease management through telehealth, mobile care, and community-based frontline workers.\nGoal 4: Strengthen Provider Partnerships Enable delivery of expanded services through shared learning, collaborative approaches, and advanced technology interventions.\nGoal 5: Stabilize Rural Provider Finances Strategic investments in technology, data infrastructure, and collaborative mechanisms addressing unique rural provider needs.\nPrimary Initiatives Initiative 1: Community-Based Preventive Care and Chronic Disease Management\nThis flagship initiative targets cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease through community-based interventions. MDH will work through existing advisory structures including the Minnesota 2035 Plan Leadership Team on Cardiovascular Health and Diabetes and the Minnesota Healthy Aging Council. These bodies include rural hospitals, health plans, clinics, Tribal health representatives, FQHCs, and community members.\nTechnical assistance providers will support:\nTechnology implementation for screening Bi-directional referral systems Remote patient monitoring Performance measure reporting Initiative 2: Rural Health Workforce Development\nWorkforce activities build education pathways and training opportunities designed to produce clinicians who will practice in rural communities. The initiative leverages existing infrastructure including the University of Minnesota RPAP while expanding Community Health Worker deployment and other frontline worker categories.\nInitiative 3: Sustain Access to Services and Keep Care Closer to Home\nThis initiative deploys technology-enabled care delivery including:\nTelehealth site expansion Mobile health vans for rural areas Community-based screening locations Regional collaborative service delivery Performance metrics include number of new telehealth sites, mobile vans deployed, and rural hospital service utilization.\nInitiative 4: Strengthening Rural Pathways to MOUD (SRP-MOUD)\nSubstance use disorder treatment receives dedicated attention through SRP-MOUD, which expands access to Medications for Opioid Use Disorder across rural Minnesota. The initiative equips emergency departments and EMS to initiate MOUD in acute-care settings and connect patients directly to ongoing treatment through primary care, community providers, or telehealth.\nProgram and Funding Distribution Program Estimated Allocation Implementing Organization Focus Cardiometabolic Disease Prevention $50-60 million MDH/Health Systems Screening, management, referrals Workforce Pipeline Development $30-40 million MDH/Training Partners Education pathways, retention Telehealth Expansion $25-35 million Health Systems/MDH Site deployment, technology Mobile Care Delivery $15-20 million Regional Providers Vans, community access points SRP-MOUD $10-15 million MDH/Treatment Providers Substance use treatment access Provider Technical Assistance $10-15 million Stratis Health/Partners Quality improvement, data Administration $15-20 million MDH Program management, oversight Note: Allocations are estimates based on application priorities and typical program structures. MDH will release detailed funding distributions as implementation proceeds.\nKey Subawardees Minnesota Hospital Association (MHA) Role: Advocacy coordination, policy alignment, hospital network engagement The MHA represents Minnesota’s 78 CAH-designated facilities and serves as a critical intermediary connecting individual hospitals to statewide RHTP activities. Dr. Rahul Koranne, MHA president and CEO, characterized RHTP as “a meaningful step toward stabilizing access and strengthening care in our rural communities.”\nStratis Health Role: Technical assistance, quality improvement, MBQIP administration Stratis Health provides quality reporting support to all Minnesota CAHs and developed the Social Drivers of Health Toolkit specifically for rural hospital community partnerships. The organization will likely serve as a technical assistance provider for RHTP-funded quality improvement activities.\nMinnesota Association of Community Health Centers Role: FQHC coordination, safety net integration FQHCs serve as critical primary care access points in underserved areas. RHTP integration with FQHC networks extends chronic disease management into communities without hospital proximity.\nUniversity of Minnesota Role: Workforce training, RPAP continuation, research support The Rural Physician Associate Program and other University health science programs provide the educational infrastructure for workforce pipeline activities.\nRegional Health Systems Major systems including Essentia Health, Sanford Health, and CentraCare operate CAHs and regional facilities across rural Minnesota. These systems will serve as implementation partners for telehealth expansion and specialty access.\nSocial Care Integration Component Included in Plan Estimated Funding Vendor/Operator Likely Funded? SDOH Screening Embedded Within chronic disease Health Systems Yes HRSN Navigation Limited Not distinct line Community Partners At Risk CHW Deployment Yes Within workforce Multiple Yes CIE Platform Not explicit TBD TBD Uncertain Minnesota’s RHTP application integrates social care components within clinical initiatives rather than establishing distinct SDOH programs. The Community-Based Preventive Care initiative includes bi-directional referrals and community partnerships, but does not specify dedicated SDOH screening requirements or closed-loop referral technology.\nCommunity Health Workers appear within workforce development, with HealthFinders in Faribault highlighted as an exemplar of CHW integration for chronic disease management. However, CHW deployment targets and employer models are not explicitly quantified in available materials.\nStratis Health’s Social Drivers of Health Toolkit provides CAHs with guidance on SDOH/HRSN strategy including governance, screening, and community partner engagement. This existing resource positions Minnesota CAHs to incorporate social care, but RHTP funding for CIE platforms or systematic referral infrastructure remains unclear.\nThe Minnesota 2035 Plan calls for expanding community health worker employment and ensuring fair pay for care coordinators who connect healthcare with community resources. RHTP appears aligned with this vision but may not fully fund implementation at the scale envisioned.\nAssessment Strengths Established Infrastructure Foundation Minnesota’s RHTP strategy builds on existing structures rather than creating new systems from scratch. The Minnesota 2035 Plan, Flex Program relationships, Stratis Health technical assistance network, and MHA coordination mechanisms provide implementation capacity that many states lack. This foundation increases the probability that RHTP funds translate into operational programs rather than planning exercises.\nCardiometabolic Focus Alignment Cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease represent substantial contributors to rural mortality and morbidity with established evidence-based interventions. Minnesota’s focus on these conditions aligns with CMS priorities and positions the state to demonstrate measurable outcomes.\nStrong Coverage Foundation The 3.8% uninsured rate and comprehensive Medical Assistance/MinnesotaCare coverage ensure that rural Minnesotans can access services that RHTP investments create. Unlike non-expansion states building infrastructure for uninsured populations, Minnesota’s transformation builds on existing coverage.\nStakeholder Engagement Quality The application development process engaged diverse stakeholders through 40+ meetings and generated bipartisan support letters. This engagement increases political sustainability and positions implementation for cooperation rather than conflict.\nTribal Health Integration Minnesota’s 11 sovereign Tribal Nations, with 10 in rural areas, receive explicit recognition in the application. Coordination with Tribal health systems addresses populations with distinct needs and governance structures.\nVulnerabilities Medicaid Erosion Risk The One Big Beautiful Bill Act’s $911 billion in projected Medicaid cuts threatens the coverage foundation that makes RHTP transformation meaningful. If 140,000 Minnesotans lose coverage during the RHTP period, investments in chronic disease management serve shrinking populations. The Minnesota Department of Human Services projects hospital losses of approximately $1 billion annually from state-directed payment restrictions alone.\nBelow-Average Funding Position At $193 million, Minnesota received less than the $200 million national average despite substantial rural health infrastructure needs. The $153 per rural resident allocation provides less investment intensity than states receiving higher per-capita awards.\nSocial Care Integration Gaps Despite Stratis Health’s SDOH Toolkit and Minnesota 2035 Plan aspirations, the RHTP application does not prominently feature systematic SDOH screening requirements, CHW deployment targets, or CIE platform procurement. Social care components remain embedded within clinical initiatives rather than receiving dedicated funding and accountability structures.\nEMS Workforce Crisis The widening gap between EMS certifications expiring and new certifications issued threatens emergency response capacity. RHTP’s chronic disease focus may not adequately address the acute care transport system that rural residents depend upon for emergencies.\nDemographic Headwinds Rural Minnesota’s negative natural change (more deaths than births) means the transformation serves aging and declining populations. Workforce recruitment to shrinking communities faces fundamental sustainability questions beyond what five-year funding can resolve.\nThe 2030 Question Minnesota’s RHTP sustainability depends on several factors beyond MDH control:\nMedicaid Policy Trajectory: Will federal Medicaid changes reduce covered populations during the transformation period? If so, infrastructure investments may serve fewer patients than projected.\nMinnesotaCare Viability: Can the Basic Health Program survive federal funding changes? If MinnesotaCare premiums rise to $80 monthly without enhanced subsidies, enrollment may decline.\nWorkforce Retention: Will healthcare workers trained through RHTP workforce initiatives remain in rural communities after initial commitments? Retention beyond service obligations determines long-term capacity.\nHealth System Financial Stability: Can rural hospitals and clinics sustain RHTP-funded services after federal funding ends? Without durable payment reform, transformation gains may evaporate.\nThe Medicaid Math Factor Impact RHTP Five-Year Investment +~$965 million Projected Medicaid Cuts (State Impact) -$140,000+ potential coverage loss MinnesotaCare Premium Increase -Unknown enrollment effect Hospital SDP Losses -~$1 billion annually when fully implemented Minnesota’s RHTP investment cannot offset coverage losses and provider payment reductions of the magnitude federal policy changes contemplate. Building chronic disease management infrastructure while the insured population shrinks inverts transformation logic. The mathematical disproportion between RHTP investment and Medicaid erosion shapes realistic expectations for what transformation can achieve.\nConclusion Minnesota’s $193 million FY2026 award validates a well-structured application that leverages existing infrastructure, engages diverse stakeholders, and focuses on measurable cardiometabolic outcomes. The 76 Critical Access Hospitals, strong technical assistance network through Stratis Health, and comprehensive public coverage through Medical Assistance and MinnesotaCare position the state favorably for implementation.\nThe challenge is context. Minnesota operates RHTP during a period when federal Medicaid policy threatens the coverage foundation that makes transformation meaningful. Building telehealth networks and chronic disease programs for populations that may lose insurance during the grant period creates fundamental tension that no application strategy can resolve.\nFor Minnesota’s 1.26 million rural residents, RHTP represents significant federal investment delivered through a state apparatus with demonstrated implementation capacity. Whether that investment produces durable transformation depends substantially on Medicaid policy decisions that could either complement or undermine the strategic vision that 40 stakeholder meetings and 350 public comments helped create.\nMinnesota has the infrastructure, the stakeholder support, and the operational capacity to execute its RHTP strategy. What remains uncertain is whether the coverage, payment, and demographic environment will allow that execution to produce sustainable results beyond the 2030 funding cliff.\nCross-References RHTP 2A: RHTP Structure and Rules RHTP 2B: Medicaid Architecture and the $911B Question RHTP 2H: The 2030 Cliff RHTP 4B: Workforce Recruitment and Retention RHTP 4C: Telehealth and Technology RHTP 4D: Community Health Workers RHTP 4H: Social Needs Integration RHTP 3.IA: Iowa (regional comparison) RHTP 3.WI: Wisconsin (regional comparison) RHTP 3.ND: North Dakota (regional comparison) RHTP 3.SD: South Dakota (regional comparison) Sources Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. “CMS Announces $50 Billion in Awards to Strengthen Rural Health in All 50 States.” CMS Newsroom, 29 Dec. 2025, www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-announces-50-billion-awards-strengthen-rural-health-all-50-states.\nCenter for Rural Policy and Development. “The State of Rural 2025.” Center for Rural Policy and Development, Jan. 2025, www.ruralmn.org/the-state-of-rural-2025/.\nHealthinsurance.org. “Medicaid Eligibility and Enrollment in Minnesota.” Healthinsurance.org, Nov. 2025, www.healthinsurance.org/medicaid/minnesota/.\nMinnesota Department of Health. “Minnesota Rural Health Transformation Program Application Fact Sheet.” MDH, Nov. 2025, www.health.mn.gov/facilities/ruralhealth/ruraltrans/docs/rhtpfacts.pdf.\nMinnesota Department of Health. “Minnesota Rural Health Transformation Program Project Narrative.” MDH, Nov. 2025, www.health.mn.gov/facilities/ruralhealth/ruraltrans/docs/rhtpnarrative.pdf.\nMinnesota Department of Health. “Minnesota Awarded $193 Million for First Year of Rural Health Transformation Program.” MDH News Release, 30 Dec. 2025, www.health.state.mn.us/news/pressrel/2025/rural123025.html.\nMinnesota Department of Health. “Rural Health Care in Minnesota: Data Highlights, November 2025.” MDH, Nov. 2025, www.health.state.mn.us/facilities/ruralhealth/docs/summaries/rhcmn.pdf.\nMinnesota Department of Health. “Rural Health Transformation Program.” MDH, Jan. 2026, www.health.mn.gov/facilities/ruralhealth/ruraltrans/index.html.\nMinnesota Department of Human Services. “Summary of Medicaid Provisions in the 2025 Federal Reconciliation Bill.” MN DHS, 2025, mn.gov/dhs/assets/summary-of-medicaid-provisions-in-the-2025-federal-reconciliation-bill_tcm1053-685438.pdf.\nMinnesota Hospital Association. “Rural Hospitals.” MHA Priority Issues, 2025, www.mnhospitals.org/policy-advocacy/priority-issues/rural-hospitals.\nMinnesota Medical Association. “MDH Applies for Federal Rural Health Transformation Program.” MMA News, Nov. 2025, www.mnmed.org/news-and-publications/news/mdh-applies-federal-rural-health-transformation-program.\nMinnesota Medical Association. “Medicaid (Medical Assistance).” MMA OBBBA Guide, 2025, www.mnmed.org/OBBBA/medicaid.\nRural Health Information Hub. “Rural Health for Minnesota Overview.” RHIhub, 2025, www.ruralhealthinfo.org/states/minnesota.\nStratis Health. “Minnesota Critical Access Hospital Reporting and Improvement Assistance.” Stratis Health, 2025, stratishealth.org/minnesota-mbqip-reporting-and-improvement-assistance/.\nRHTP 3.MN: Minnesota Series 3: State Implementation Rural Health Transformation Project Version 3: January 2026\n",

<p>Minnesota received <strong>$193 million in FY2026 RHTP funding</strong>, positioning the state slightly below the national average of $200 million despite operating one of the nation&rsquo;s most extensive Critical Access Hospital networks. The Minnesota Department of Health submitted an application requesting <strong>$1 billion over five years</strong>, reflecting comprehensive stakeholder engagement through more than 40 meetings and nearly 350 public responses. The resulting award represents a 3.5% reduction from the average requested annual allocation.</p>
<p>The state&rsquo;s strategic approach centers on <strong>cardiometabolic disease management</strong>, workforce pipeline development, and technology-enabled care delivery. Minnesota&rsquo;s application builds on established infrastructure including the Minnesota 2035 Plan on Cardiovascular Health and Diabetes, positioning RHTP as an acceleration mechanism for existing priorities rather than creation of entirely new systems.</p>

<p>Minnesota spans <strong>86,936 square miles</strong> across 87 counties, with approximately <strong>1.26 million residents</strong> (22.1% of the population) living in nonmetropolitan areas according to 2023 Census data. The state&rsquo;s rural character concentrates in northern and western regions while the seven-county Twin Cities metropolitan area contains over 60% of the total population and continues to grow faster than rural counterparts.</p>

<p>Minnesota&rsquo;s State Demographic Center classifies counties using Rural-Urban Commuting Area codes rather than simple population thresholds. Under this framework, 14 counties qualify as <strong>entirely rural</strong>, 35 as <strong>town/rural mix</strong>, 25 as <strong>urban/town/rural mix</strong>, and only 13 as <strong>entirely urban</strong>. This nuanced classification reveals that rural character extends well beyond the 14 most isolated counties.</p>
<p>Population trends present a complex picture. While the most rural counties experienced steady decline during the 2010s, the early 2020s brought modest population gains from domestic migration. However, long-term projections suggest this reversal cannot be sustained. Rural Minnesota&rsquo;s aging population produces <strong>more deaths than births</strong>, creating negative natural change that in-migration cannot fully offset. The state projects population growth from 5.78 million in 2024 to 6.11 million by 2075, but this growth concentrates almost entirely in metropolitan areas.</p>
<p>Minnesota is home to <strong>11 sovereign Tribal Nations</strong>, including seven Anishinaabe (Chippewa, Ojibwe) reservations and four Dakota (Sioux) communities. Ten of these nations are located in rural areas, creating distinct healthcare delivery challenges that include Indian Health Service coordination, cultural competency requirements, and sovereign governance considerations.</p>

<p>The <strong>76 Critical Access Hospitals</strong> rank Minnesota third nationally behind Texas (82) and Kansas. Of these, one is an Indian Health Service facility not counted among community hospitals. The Minnesota Hospital Association reports 78 CAH-designated facilities when including recent conversions, though the official MDH count remains 76.</p>
<p>Eleven Minnesota CAHs received recognition in the <strong>2025 Chartis Top 100 Critical Access Hospitals</strong> list, demonstrating quality performance alongside network density. Recognized facilities include Aspirus Lake View Hospital in Two Harbors, which achieved Top 100 status for the second consecutive year. The ranking evaluates market share, quality, outcomes, patient perspective, cost, charge, and financial performance.</p>
<p>Minnesota&rsquo;s Flex Program supports all CAHs through quality improvement activities administered by <strong>Stratis Health</strong>, the state&rsquo;s designated technical assistance provider. Stratis Health operates the Medicare Beneficiary Quality Improvement Project (MBQIP), hosts monthly open calls for CAH staff, and developed a Social Drivers of Health Toolkit specifically for CAHs and their community partners.</p>
<p>Hospital service availability has declined over the past decade. Between 2013 and 2023, rural hospitals lost inpatient and outpatient surgery capacity, detoxification services, CT and MRI availability, PET services, organ transplant capability, and renal dialysis. Much of this loss occurred through service line elimination rather than hospital closure, though the cumulative effect reduces care available in rural communities.</p>

<p>The state&rsquo;s <strong>Rural Emergency Medical Services workforce is in crisis</strong>, according to MDH data. Expired EMS certifications increasingly outpace new certifications issued, creating a gap that threatens emergency response capacity in areas where transport times to hospitals already extend 30 minutes or longer.</p>
<p>Minnesota ranks in the <strong>bottom 20% nationally</strong> for general pediatricians per 100,000 children. Developmental specialists who assess and treat children with Autism Spectrum Disorder and serious emotional disorders face multi-month waiting lists that rural families cannot easily navigate given distance constraints.</p>
<p>The University of Minnesota Rural Physician Associate Program (RPAP) represents a distinctive state asset. This program places medical students in rural communities for extended clinical training, building both skills and relationships that increase rural practice likelihood after graduation. RPAP graduates practice in rural Minnesota at rates substantially higher than medical school graduates without rural training exposure.</p>
<h3 id="economic-and-social-context">Economic and Social Context<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#economic-and-social-context">#</a></h3>
<p>Minnesota&rsquo;s economic position distinguishes it from many states seeking RHTP funding. The state&rsquo;s <strong>median household income of $90,340</strong> (2023) approaches the national high end. Unemployment consistently runs below national averages. The seven-county metro area drives substantial economic growth while Greater Minnesota maintains relative stability through agriculture, manufacturing, and regional service centers.</p>
<p>Yet aggregate prosperity masks rural disparities. Approximately <strong>105,000 people live in concentrated poverty areas</strong> in rural Minnesota. Urban areas show 9.1% poverty rates compared to 11.8% in large rural cities and 10.7% in small town rural areas. Agricultural employment, while economically productive, carries occupational hazards including chemical exposure and machinery accidents.</p>

<p>Minnesota&rsquo;s below-average award reflects the formula&rsquo;s interaction with state characteristics. The <strong>22.1% rural population share</strong> ranks lower than states receiving larger awards, though the absolute rural population of 1.26 million exceeds many competitors. The 76 CAHs generate scoring weight, but states with more extreme rurality metrics (Montana, Wyoming, Alaska) received higher per-capita allocations.</p>
<h3 id="formula-position">Formula Position<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#formula-position">#</a></h3>
<p>Minnesota&rsquo;s award breaks down approximately as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>50% equal distribution:</strong> ~$100 million baseline</li>
<li><strong>50% workload factors:</strong> ~$93 million based on rurality metrics and application scoring</li>
</ul>
<p>The $93 million workload allocation positions Minnesota slightly below median, suggesting the application scored competitively but the state&rsquo;s rurality metrics did not maximize available points. States with larger proportions of population in rural census tracts, higher shares of rural health facilities relative to national totals, and more extreme frontier characteristics captured larger workload allocations.</p>

<p><strong>Minnesota&rsquo;s uninsured rate stands at an all-time low of 3.8%</strong> in 2025, reflecting the combined effect of Medical Assistance, MinnesotaCare (the state&rsquo;s Basic Health Program), and MNsure marketplace coverage. This coverage foundation provides RHTP initiatives with insured populations who can access transformed services.</p>
<p>However, the <strong>One Big Beautiful Bill Act threatens this foundation</strong>. The Minnesota Department of Human Services estimates federal Medicaid changes could result in <strong>coverage loss for up to 140,000 Minnesotans</strong> through work requirements, six-month eligibility redeterminations, immigration status restrictions, and provider payment limits. The Minnesota Medical Association projects hospitals could lose roughly $1 billion annually from state-directed payment limitations once fully implemented.</p>
<p>MinnesotaCare faces particular uncertainty. The program depends on federal Basic Health Program funding, which may become unavailable due to legislation changes. Monthly premiums, currently capped at $28, will rise to $80 in 2026 if enhanced ACA subsidies expire as scheduled.</p>

<li><strong>Nearly 350 public responses</strong> to input requests</li>
<li><strong>Letters of support</strong> from bipartisan state and federal lawmakers</li>
<li><strong>Endorsements</strong> from Minnesota Hospital Association, Association of Minnesota Counties, Minnesota Medical Association, Minnesota Association of Community Health Centers, and Minnesota Office of Emergency Medical Services</li>
</ul>
<p>Commissioner of Health Dr. Brooke Cunningham positioned the application as responsive to &ldquo;the real needs of Greater Minnesota,&rdquo; emphasizing technology tools that enable care delivery closer to patients&rsquo; homes.</p>
<h3 id="strategic-framework">Strategic Framework<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#strategic-framework">#</a></h3>
<p>Minnesota&rsquo;s RHTP strategy organizes around <strong>five interconnected goals</strong> that align with CMS statutory priorities:</p>
<p><strong>Goal 1: Improve Cardiometabolic Health Outcomes</strong>
Focus on cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease prevention and management among rural Minnesotans at risk or already diagnosed.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2: Build Workforce Pipelines</strong>
Create education pathways and promote training opportunities to sustainably expand the healthcare workforce in rural areas.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 3: Expand Access Through Technology</strong>
Deploy new entry points for community-based screenings, preventive care, and chronic disease management through telehealth, mobile care, and community-based frontline workers.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 4: Strengthen Provider Partnerships</strong>
Enable delivery of expanded services through shared learning, collaborative approaches, and advanced technology interventions.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 5: Stabilize Rural Provider Finances</strong>
Strategic investments in technology, data infrastructure, and collaborative mechanisms addressing unique rural provider needs.</p>
<h3 id="primary-initiatives">Primary Initiatives<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#primary-initiatives">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Initiative 1: Community-Based Preventive Care and Chronic Disease Management</strong></p>
<p>This flagship initiative targets cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease through community-based interventions. MDH will work through existing advisory structures including the <strong>Minnesota 2035 Plan Leadership Team on Cardiovascular Health and Diabetes</strong> and the <strong>Minnesota Healthy Aging Council</strong>. These bodies include rural hospitals, health plans, clinics, Tribal health representatives, FQHCs, and community members.</p>
<p>Technical assistance providers will support:</p>
<ul>
<li>Technology implementation for screening</li>
<li>Bi-directional referral systems</li>
<li>Remote patient monitoring</li>
<li>Performance measure reporting</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Initiative 2: Rural Health Workforce Development</strong></p>
<p>Workforce activities build education pathways and training opportunities designed to produce clinicians who will practice in rural communities. The initiative leverages existing infrastructure including the University of Minnesota RPAP while expanding Community Health Worker deployment and other frontline worker categories.</p>
<p><strong>Initiative 3: Sustain Access to Services and Keep Care Closer to Home</strong></p>
<p>This initiative deploys technology-enabled care delivery including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Telehealth site expansion</li>
<li>Mobile health vans for rural areas</li>
<li>Community-based screening locations</li>
<li>Regional collaborative service delivery</li>
</ul>
<p>Performance metrics include number of new telehealth sites, mobile vans deployed, and rural hospital service utilization.</p>
<p><strong>Initiative 4: Strengthening Rural Pathways to MOUD (SRP-MOUD)</strong></p>
<p>Substance use disorder treatment receives dedicated attention through SRP-MOUD, which expands access to Medications for Opioid Use Disorder across rural Minnesota. The initiative equips emergency departments and EMS to initiate MOUD in acute-care settings and connect patients directly to ongoing treatment through primary care, community providers, or telehealth.</p>

Role: Advocacy coordination, policy alignment, hospital network engagement
The MHA represents Minnesota&rsquo;s 78 CAH-designated facilities and serves as a critical intermediary connecting individual hospitals to statewide RHTP activities. Dr. Rahul Koranne, MHA president and CEO, characterized RHTP as &ldquo;a meaningful step toward stabilizing access and strengthening care in our rural communities.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Stratis Health</strong>
Role: Technical assistance, quality improvement, MBQIP administration
Stratis Health provides quality reporting support to all Minnesota CAHs and developed the Social Drivers of Health Toolkit specifically for rural hospital community partnerships. The organization will likely serve as a technical assistance provider for RHTP-funded quality improvement activities.</p>
<p><strong>Minnesota Association of Community Health Centers</strong>
Role: FQHC coordination, safety net integration
FQHCs serve as critical primary care access points in underserved areas. RHTP integration with FQHC networks extends chronic disease management into communities without hospital proximity.</p>

<p>Minnesota&rsquo;s RHTP application integrates social care components within clinical initiatives rather than establishing distinct SDOH programs. The <strong>Community-Based Preventive Care initiative</strong> includes bi-directional referrals and community partnerships, but does not specify dedicated SDOH screening requirements or closed-loop referral technology.</p>
<p><strong>Community Health Workers</strong> appear within workforce development, with HealthFinders in Faribault highlighted as an exemplar of CHW integration for chronic disease management. However, CHW deployment targets and employer models are not explicitly quantified in available materials.</p>
<p><strong>Stratis Health&rsquo;s Social Drivers of Health Toolkit</strong> provides CAHs with guidance on SDOH/HRSN strategy including governance, screening, and community partner engagement. This existing resource positions Minnesota CAHs to incorporate social care, but RHTP funding for CIE platforms or systematic referral infrastructure remains unclear.</p>
<p>The <strong>Minnesota 2035 Plan</strong> calls for expanding community health worker employment and ensuring fair pay for care coordinators who connect healthcare with community resources. RHTP appears aligned with this vision but may not fully fund implementation at the scale envisioned.</p>
<h2 id="assessment">Assessment<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#assessment">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="strengths">Strengths<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#strengths">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Established Infrastructure Foundation</strong>
Minnesota&rsquo;s RHTP strategy builds on existing structures rather than creating new systems from scratch. The Minnesota 2035 Plan, Flex Program relationships, Stratis Health technical assistance network, and MHA coordination mechanisms provide implementation capacity that many states lack. This foundation increases the probability that RHTP funds translate into operational programs rather than planning exercises.</p>
<p><strong>Cardiometabolic Focus Alignment</strong>
Cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease represent substantial contributors to rural mortality and morbidity with established evidence-based interventions. Minnesota&rsquo;s focus on these conditions aligns with CMS priorities and positions the state to demonstrate measurable outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Strong Coverage Foundation</strong>
The 3.8% uninsured rate and comprehensive Medical Assistance/MinnesotaCare coverage ensure that rural Minnesotans can access services that RHTP investments create. Unlike non-expansion states building infrastructure for uninsured populations, Minnesota&rsquo;s transformation builds on existing coverage.</p>
<p><strong>Stakeholder Engagement Quality</strong>
The application development process engaged diverse stakeholders through 40+ meetings and generated bipartisan support letters. This engagement increases political sustainability and positions implementation for cooperation rather than conflict.</p>
<p><strong>Tribal Health Integration</strong>
Minnesota&rsquo;s 11 sovereign Tribal Nations, with 10 in rural areas, receive explicit recognition in the application. Coordination with Tribal health systems addresses populations with distinct needs and governance structures.</p>
<h3 id="vulnerabilities">Vulnerabilities<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#vulnerabilities">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Medicaid Erosion Risk</strong>
The One Big Beautiful Bill Act&rsquo;s $911 billion in projected Medicaid cuts threatens the coverage foundation that makes RHTP transformation meaningful. If 140,000 Minnesotans lose coverage during the RHTP period, investments in chronic disease management serve shrinking populations. The Minnesota Department of Human Services projects hospital losses of approximately $1 billion annually from state-directed payment restrictions alone.</p>
<p><strong>Below-Average Funding Position</strong>
At $193 million, Minnesota received less than the $200 million national average despite substantial rural health infrastructure needs. The $153 per rural resident allocation provides less investment intensity than states receiving higher per-capita awards.</p>
<p><strong>Social Care Integration Gaps</strong>
Despite Stratis Health&rsquo;s SDOH Toolkit and Minnesota 2035 Plan aspirations, the RHTP application does not prominently feature systematic SDOH screening requirements, CHW deployment targets, or CIE platform procurement. Social care components remain embedded within clinical initiatives rather than receiving dedicated funding and accountability structures.</p>
<p><strong>EMS Workforce Crisis</strong>
The widening gap between EMS certifications expiring and new certifications issued threatens emergency response capacity. RHTP&rsquo;s chronic disease focus may not adequately address the acute care transport system that rural residents depend upon for emergencies.</p>
<p><strong>Demographic Headwinds</strong>
Rural Minnesota&rsquo;s negative natural change (more deaths than births) means the transformation serves aging and declining populations. Workforce recruitment to shrinking communities faces fundamental sustainability questions beyond what five-year funding can resolve.</p>
<h3 id="the-2030-question">The 2030 Question<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-2030-question">#</a></h3>
<p>Minnesota&rsquo;s RHTP sustainability depends on several factors beyond MDH control:</p>
<p><strong>Medicaid Policy Trajectory:</strong> Will federal Medicaid changes reduce covered populations during the transformation period? If so, infrastructure investments may serve fewer patients than projected.</p>
<p><strong>MinnesotaCare Viability:</strong> Can the Basic Health Program survive federal funding changes? If MinnesotaCare premiums rise to $80 monthly without enhanced subsidies, enrollment may decline.</p>
<p><strong>Workforce Retention:</strong> Will healthcare workers trained through RHTP workforce initiatives remain in rural communities after initial commitments? Retention beyond service obligations determines long-term capacity.</p>
<p><strong>Health System Financial Stability:</strong> Can rural hospitals and clinics sustain RHTP-funded services after federal funding ends? Without durable payment reform, transformation gains may evaporate.</p>

<p>Minnesota&rsquo;s RHTP investment cannot offset coverage losses and provider payment reductions of the magnitude federal policy changes contemplate. Building chronic disease management infrastructure while the insured population shrinks inverts transformation logic. The mathematical disproportion between RHTP investment and Medicaid erosion shapes realistic expectations for what transformation can achieve.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>Minnesota&rsquo;s $193 million FY2026 award validates a well-structured application that leverages existing infrastructure, engages diverse stakeholders, and focuses on measurable cardiometabolic outcomes. The <strong>76 Critical Access Hospitals</strong>, strong technical assistance network through Stratis Health, and comprehensive public coverage through Medical Assistance and MinnesotaCare position the state favorably for implementation.</p>
<p>The challenge is context. Minnesota operates RHTP during a period when federal Medicaid policy threatens the coverage foundation that makes transformation meaningful. Building telehealth networks and chronic disease programs for populations that may lose insurance during the grant period creates fundamental tension that no application strategy can resolve.</p>
<p>For Minnesota&rsquo;s 1.26 million rural residents, RHTP represents significant federal investment delivered through a state apparatus with demonstrated implementation capacity. <strong>Whether that investment produces durable transformation depends substantially on Medicaid policy decisions that could either complement or undermine the strategic vision</strong> that 40 stakeholder meetings and 350 public comments helped create.</p>
<p>Minnesota has the infrastructure, the stakeholder support, and the operational capacity to execute its RHTP strategy. What remains uncertain is whether the coverage, payment, and demographic environment will allow that execution to produce sustainable results beyond the 2030 funding cliff.</p>
