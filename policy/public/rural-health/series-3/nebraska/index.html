  "articleBody": "Nebraska received $218.5 million in FY2026 RHTP funding, positioning it slightly above the national average of $200 million. This award reflects both the state’s significant rural footprint and an ambitious application framing rural health transformation around food, farming, and family values.\nThe Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) proposed seven integrated initiatives designed to build what it calls a “prevention-first, tech-enabled sustainable rural health care system.” With 88 of 93 counties classified as rural and 37% of Nebraskans living in rural areas, the state faces profound challenges: 48 counties qualify as food deserts, 52% of counties lack adequate maternity care, and nearly 60% of Critical Access Hospitals operate with negative margins.\nNebraska’s five-year projected total of approximately $1.09 billion represents historic investment in agricultural communities where farming sustains the economy but healthcare infrastructure struggles to survive.\nRural Health Landscape State Context Nebraska spans 77,000 square miles across the Great Plains, with population concentrated in the eastern metropolitan areas of Omaha and Lincoln while vast western territories remain sparsely settled. The state’s famous Sandhills region encompasses one of the largest grass-stabilized dune systems in the Western Hemisphere, an area larger than some New England states where cattle outnumber people by orders of magnitude.\nMetric Value Total Population 2.04 million Rural Population 740,000 (37%) Total Counties 93 Rural Counties 88 Frontier Counties 30 Nebraska’s rural character exceeds national averages: 28.1% of the state’s total population lives in rural areas by census definition, compared to approximately 20% nationally. This concentration creates both opportunity and challenge. Rural Nebraskans maintain strong community ties and agricultural economic foundations, but population decline in smaller counties accelerates healthcare access erosion.\nMore than half of Nebraska’s 93 counties have experienced population decline over recent decades. Douglas County (Omaha) leads with 596,000 residents, while neighboring Sarpy County shows the strongest growth. Meanwhile, Logan County has lost 16.8% of its population since 2020, and several western counties lost more than 10%.\nGeographic Diversity Nebraska’s healthcare challenges vary dramatically by region:\nEastern Nebraska: The Omaha and Lincoln metropolitan areas concentrate medical resources, specialty care, and teaching hospitals. Urban residents enjoy access comparable to national averages.\nCentral Nebraska: Intermediate communities like Grand Island, Hastings, and Kearney maintain regional hospital capacity but face workforce recruitment challenges.\nWestern Nebraska and the Panhandle: The most profound access barriers exist here. Scottsbluff serves as the regional center for communities where 55.5% of all square miles qualify as frontier and remote, defined as populations living 60+ minutes from urban areas of 50,000 or more.\nSandhills Region: Among the most isolated healthcare environments in the continental United States. Communities may be 100+ miles from the nearest hospital, with unpaved roads and seasonal weather complications.\nNative American Communities Four federally recognized tribes maintain headquarters in Nebraska:\nOmaha Tribe Ponca Tribe Santee Sioux Nation Winnebago Tribe The Native American population increased 1.7% between 2010 and 2020, and tribal health systems represent important components of the rural healthcare network. RHTP subawardees include tribal organizations (TO) as partners in regionalized access and mobile health initiatives.\nHealthcare Infrastructure Nebraska’s rural health infrastructure reflects both strength and strain:\nFacility Type Count Notes Critical Access Hospitals 62 Second highest total nationally after Texas Rural Health Clinics Multiple Primary care access points FQHC Sites 51 Serving 123,000+ patients Health Center Association Members 7 Statewide network CAH Networks 5 Coordinated quality improvement The 62 Critical Access Hospitals represent one of the highest CAH densities in the nation. Nebraska’s rural hospitals collectively make up over 68% of all hospitals in the state, compared to 35% nationally. This infrastructure reflects historical investment in community-based healthcare, but financial sustainability remains precarious.\nCAH Network Structure: The Nebraska Flex Program utilizes five CAH networks ranging in size from 7 to 28 member hospitals. Each network includes CAHs and one larger regional or urban hospital, with network coordinators facilitating quarterly meetings to share best practices and identify technical assistance needs.\nFinancial Distress Rural hospital financial fragility defines Nebraska’s baseline:\nFinancial Metric Value CAHs with Negative Operating Margins Nearly 60% Pharmacy Closures Since 2020 69 (14% of pharmacies) Hospital Employment Statewide 54,000+ The Nebraska RHTP application acknowledges these facilities operate with “thin margins due to lower volumes, high fixed costs, and payer mix challenges.” The financial baseline resembles Montana’s 89% negative margin rate, suggesting structural challenges extend across Great Plains states.\nPharmacy closures since 2020 disproportionately affected rural communities. The application notes 14% of pharmacies statewide closed, “mostly rural,” creating medication access gaps that compound other healthcare shortages.\nHealth Professional Shortages Nebraska’s workforce gaps are severe and widespread:\nDesignation Type Scope Counties Without Primary Care Physician 14 Counties with Family Practice Shortage 58 of 93 Counties with OB/GYN Shortage 76 of 93 (entire or partial) Counties with Psychiatry/Mental Health Shortage Majority Projected Nursing Shortage (2025) 5,000+ Maternity care deserts affect 52% of Nebraska counties, forcing pregnant women to travel 30+ minutes for standard prenatal care. In 2024, 4.1% of women in rural Nebraska had pre-pregnancy hypertension compared to 3.5% in urban areas, elevating preterm birth risk.\nBehavioral health access remains severely constrained. Nebraska has only two crisis stabilization centers statewide. Patients needing crisis services may travel over 4 hours for specialized care.\nHealth Outcomes Rural health disparities manifest in measurable outcomes:\nIndicator Rural Nebraska Urban Nebraska Overweight/Obese Adults (2022) 72.5% Lower Infant Mortality (2023) 7.2 per 1,000 6.3 per 1,000 Pre-Pregnancy Hypertension (2024) 4.1% 3.5% Suicide rates among rural Nebraskans exceed urban rates, and the gap continues to widen. Chronic disease prevalence connects directly to the food desert paradox: 48 of 93 counties qualify as food deserts despite Nebraska’s agricultural abundance. Children in farming communities lack access to healthy foods even as crops and cattle surround them.\nRHTP Award and Context Metric Nebraska National Average FY2026 Award $218.5 million $200 million Five-Year Projected Total ~$1.09 billion ~$1 billion Rural Population 740,000 Varies Per-Capita (Rural) ~$295 ~$150 Award Rank Above Average N/A Nebraska’s award exceeds the national average by approximately 9%, reflecting both rural demographics and application quality. The state’s proposed annual budget of $200 million aligned closely with the actual FY2026 award.\nFormula Position Nebraska benefits from RHTP’s allocation structure:\n50% equal distribution: $100 million baseline regardless of population 25% rurality metrics: 88 rural counties and 30 frontier counties generate favorable scores 25% application scoring: Strong marks on prevention and MAHA alignment The formula treats Nebraska favorably relative to large rural states like Texas or California, where absolute rural populations vastly exceed Nebraska’s but per-capita allocation proves lower.\nMedicaid Expansion Status Nebraska expanded Medicaid in October 2020 following a 2018 ballot initiative approved by voters after the legislature rejected expansion for six consecutive years. The Heritage Health Adult program extends coverage to adults 19-64 with income up to 138% of the federal poverty level.\nMedicaid Metric Value Total Medicaid/CHIP Enrollment 340,000+ Expansion Population 71,000+ Medicaid as % of State Health Spending Approximately $4 billion Managed Care Organizations 3 (Molina, Nebraska Total Care, UnitedHealthcare) Expansion reduced uninsurance substantially, but the relatively recent implementation (2020) means Nebraska’s healthcare system continues adjusting to the expanded coverage population. The Heritage Health managed care structure coordinates physical health, behavioral health, dental, and pharmacy services.\nMedicaid Cut Exposure Nebraska’s Medicaid architecture creates specific RHTP-Medicaid tension:\nExpansion population (~71,000) faces coverage uncertainty under H.R. 1 provisions Rural hospitals restructured finances around expanded coverage and supplemental payments Projected Medicaid cuts dwarf RHTP investment on net basis The Nebraska Public Media coverage of the RHTP award explicitly framed the funding as “meant to offset Medicaid cuts,” recognizing the mathematical reality that $218.5 million annually cannot compensate for larger revenue losses if Medicaid cuts materialize as projected.\nState Approach Lead Agency and Governance The Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) serves as lead agency for RHTP implementation. The state’s application emphasizes partnership-driven implementation through requests for application (RFA) to distribute funding across identified subawardees.\nDHHS brings existing rural health infrastructure through the Office of Community and Rural Health, which manages the Flex Program and coordinates with CAH networks. The Nebraska State Office of Rural Health tracks shortage area designations and coordinates federal grant programs.\nStrategic Framework Nebraska’s RHTP strategy centers on three interconnected themes:\nPrevention-First: The application explicitly aligns with Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) priorities, emphasizing obesity reduction, nutrition education, and chronic disease prevention as foundational rather than supplementary components.\nTech-Enabled: Consumer-facing technology, remote patient monitoring, mobile health units, and telehealth expansion feature prominently across multiple initiatives.\nCommunity Partnership: The “grow local” workforce strategy and agricultural sector engagement reflect Nebraska’s community-based approach to healthcare transformation.\nSeven Integrated Initiatives Nebraska’s RHTP proposal includes seven initiatives addressing rural health comprehensively:\nInitiative Focus Area Key Subawardees 1. Make Rural Nebraska Healthy Again: Food as Medicine Prevention, Nutrition Nebraska Department of Education, UNK 2. Regionalized Rural Access and Navigation Care Coordination LHDs, Tribal Organizations, rural hospitals 3. Rural Workforce Acceleration Workforce NHA, universities, community colleges 4. eHealth and Mobile Technology, Access NPQIC, dental schools, pharmacies 5. Rural Emergency Behavioral Health Behavioral Health Nebraska Medical Association 6. ALF Special Needs Population Incentive Model Long-Term Care Assisted living facilities 7. Rural Health Technology Catalyst Fund Innovation Technology vendors, rural providers Program and Funding Distribution Program Focus Implementing Organization Food as Medicine School kitchens, food hubs, nutrition education Nebraska Dept. of Education, UNK Regionalized Access Hub-and-spoke networks, navigation LHDs, tribal organizations, extension offices Workforce Acceleration Recruitment, training, retention NHA, universities, community colleges eHealth and Mobile Mobile units, telehealth, remote monitoring NPQIC, UNMC, Creighton, pharmacies Behavioral Health Crisis continuum, SUD services Nebraska Medical Association ALF Special Needs Provider add-ons, facility modernization Assisted living facilities Technology Catalyst Fund Innovation grants Rural providers, technology vendors Initiative Details Initiative 1: Make Rural Nebraska Healthy Again through Food as Medicine\nNebraska’s distinctive MAHA-aligned initiative addresses the food desert paradox: agricultural counties lacking healthy food access. Components include:\nTransforming rural school kitchens to serve as nutrition hubs Developing regional food hubs connecting farmers, ranchers, and healthcare Nutrition education and fitness programs Addressing 72.5% rural obesity rate through prevention Subawardees include Nebraska Department of Education and University of Nebraska Kearney. This initiative represents Nebraska’s clearest alignment with current administration health priorities.\nInitiative 2: Regionalized Rural Access and Navigation\nHub-and-spoke regional networks will coordinate:\nEmergency response Maternal care access Post-acute follow-up Preventive care services Subawardees span Local Health Departments (LHDs), Tribal Organizations, Nebraska Association of Local Health Departments, Nebraska County Extension Offices, and rural hospitals and clinics. The initiative leverages existing infrastructure through 19 local health department regions.\nInitiative 3: Rural Workforce Acceleration\nThe “grow local” strategy targets workforce gaps through:\nRecruitment from rural communities Training partnerships with Nebraska and regional institutions Retention incentives for five-year rural service commitments VR/AR-based telehealth training Subawardees include Nebraska Hospital Association (NHA), community colleges, private colleges, University of Nebraska system, and Creighton University. Legislative commitment includes CHW certification by end of CY2027.\nInitiative 4: eHealth and Mobile\nTechnology-driven access expansion includes:\nMobile clinical units Oral health teams addressing 85 medically underserved communities Technology-enhanced pharmacy services countering 69 pharmacy closures Consumer-facing remote patient monitoring Subawardees include Nebraska Perinatal Quality Improvement Collaborative, LHDs, tribal organizations, Creighton University and UNMC School of Dentistry, and Nebraska Enhanced Services Pharmacies (NESP) clinically integrated network.\nInitiative 5: Rural Emergency Behavioral Health\nContinuum of care for behavioral health and substance use includes:\nEarly intervention programs Emergency behavioral health services SUD treatment access The Nebraska Medical Association serves as primary subawardee, addressing the state’s severe mental health access gaps where patients may travel 4+ hours for crisis services.\nInitiative 6: ALF Special Needs Population Incentive Model\nAssisted living facility support includes:\nProvider add-on payments for complex residents Modernization grants for high-acuity capability Serving residents with medical, physical, intellectual, and other special needs This initiative addresses Nebraska’s aging rural population where ALFs serve as essential long-term care infrastructure.\nInitiative 7: Rural Health Technology Catalyst Fund\nInnovation investment includes:\nHigh-tech innovation grants for rural providers Disease management technology Financial sustainability tools Workforce capacity technology RHTP NOFO caps technology catalyst spending at the lesser of 10% of total funding or $20 million per budget period. Nebraska’s initiative targets critical healthcare gaps through strategic technology deployment.\nSocial Care Integration Component Included Funding Level Implementing Organization Likely Funded? SDOH/HRSN Embedded Not itemized LHDs, extension offices At Risk CHW Programs Yes Workforce allocation NHA, universities At Risk CIE Platform Limited Not itemized NeHII (existing) Existing Only Navigation Yes Regional initiative LHDs, tribal organizations Yes SDOH/HRSN Assessment Nebraska’s application integrates social determinants through food security, nutrition, and navigation rather than explicit SDOH screening infrastructure. The Food as Medicine initiative addresses social determinants through agricultural and educational partnerships rather than clinical screening protocols.\nStrengths: Food desert intervention represents meaningful SDOH investment. Agricultural sector engagement creates sustainable food access infrastructure beyond traditional healthcare.\nGaps: No dedicated SDOH screening infrastructure investment. Provider-level HRSN implementation depends on individual facility capacity without statewide coordination.\nCommunity Health Worker Programs CHW deployment appears within workforce initiatives rather than as standalone programming. The state committed to CHW certification by end of CY2027 as a legislative and regulatory action, suggesting infrastructure development remains in progress.\nThe “grow local” strategy emphasizes recruiting from rural communities, which could include CHW pipeline development, but dedicated CHW funding and deployment targets remain unclear.\nCIE Platform Status Nebraska operates the Nebraska Health Information Initiative (NeHII), an existing health information exchange. The Flex Program has partnered with NeHII to bring MBQIP reporting to CAHs, suggesting interoperability infrastructure exists.\nHowever, RHTP does not appear to fund significant CIE expansion or closed-loop referral capability beyond existing infrastructure. Social care referral capacity remains limited compared to states with dedicated CIE investment.\nNavigation Services Regional navigation through LHDs and tribal organizations represents Nebraska’s strongest social care component. The hub-and-spoke model positions navigation within regionalized care networks rather than standalone CBO infrastructure.\nCounty Extension Offices as subawardees represent innovative partnership leveraging agricultural outreach infrastructure for healthcare navigation, particularly appropriate for rural farming communities.\nKey Subawardees Organization Role Estimated Funding Focus Areas Nebraska Hospital Association (NHA) Workforce partner Significant Recruitment, training, CAH support University of Nebraska System Academic partner Significant UNMC, workforce training, rural health Creighton University Academic partner Moderate Medical education, dental training Nebraska Department of Education Prevention partner Moderate School nutrition, food hubs Local Health Departments (19 regions) Regional coordinators Distributed Navigation, mobile health, screening Tribal Organizations Tribal health partners TBD Regional access, mobile services Nebraska Medical Association Behavioral health TBD Crisis continuum, SUD treatment Nebraska Enhanced Services Pharmacies Pharmacy network TBD Technology-enhanced pharmacy services Community Colleges Workforce training Distributed Allied health education Nebraska Hospital Association NHA plays a central role as workforce development partner and represents the state’s 62 CAHs and other hospitals. The organization’s advocacy secured LB 1087 (2024) establishing appropriate Medicaid reimbursement and LB 256 (2024) providing telehealth parity, demonstrating legislative influence supporting RHTP implementation.\nUniversity of Nebraska Medical Center UNMC’s Office of Rural Health Initiatives provides strategic leadership for rural outreach education across five pillars: rural education and workforce preparation, delivery models, emerging technologies, rural health research, and organizational structure. UNMC and Creighton dental schools serve as oral health team training partners.\nNebraska Health Information Initiative NeHII provides existing HIE infrastructure that RHTP implementation can leverage without procurement costs. The partnership with the Flex Program for automated MBQIP reporting demonstrates interoperability capability for quality measurement.\nAssessment Strengths MAHA Alignment: Nebraska’s Food as Medicine initiative represents distinctive alignment with current administration health priorities. Addressing obesity (72.5% rural prevalence) through agricultural partnerships leverages the state’s economic foundation while meeting policy expectations.\nAgricultural Integration: County Extension Offices as healthcare navigation partners represents innovative infrastructure reuse. Nebraska’s farming communities may respond better to agricultural sector engagement than traditional healthcare outreach.\nCAH Network Density: 62 Critical Access Hospitals organized into five networks provide coordination infrastructure few states possess. The Flex Program’s quality improvement focus and NeHII partnership demonstrate existing capacity for transformation measurement.\nMedicaid Expansion Foundation: October 2020 expansion reduced uninsurance and provides coverage foundation for transformation initiatives. Heritage Health managed care structure coordinates comprehensive benefits.\nRegional Hub-and-Spoke Design: The regionalized access initiative matches Nebraska’s geography where concentrated resources in regional centers can extend through spoke connections to isolated communities.\nLegislative Momentum: Recent legislative wins including Medicaid reimbursement (LB 1087), telehealth parity (LB 256), and 340B protection demonstrate political environment supporting rural health investment.\nVulnerabilities Financial Baseline: Nearly 60% of CAHs operating at negative margins mirrors regional patterns across Great Plains states. Transformation investments compete with survival needs when underlying revenue models remain broken.\nWorkforce Scale: 14 counties without any primary care physician and 58 of 93 counties with family practice shortage designations represent gaps that recruitment incentives alone cannot close. The projected 5,000+ nursing shortage in 2025 suggests structural workforce crisis.\nMaternity Care Desert Extent: 52% of counties lacking adequate maternity care creates specific risk for maternal and infant outcomes. Travel distances for prenatal care in rural areas exceed safe parameters.\nPharmacy Collapse: 69 pharmacy closures since 2020 (14% statewide) represent infrastructure loss that technology-enhanced services must overcome. Rural medication access requires solutions beyond telehealth.\nSocial Care Investment Gaps: Despite Food as Medicine framing, dedicated SDOH screening infrastructure, CHW deployment, and CIE expansion receive minimal explicit funding. Existing NeHII infrastructure may remain underutilized for social care coordination.\nBehavioral Health Access: Only two crisis stabilization centers statewide and 4+ hour travel times for specialized care represent safety concerns that the Nebraska Medical Association partnership must address rapidly.\nSocial Care Survival Assessment SDOH/HRSN: At risk. Food as Medicine addresses food security specifically, but comprehensive SDOH screening lacks infrastructure investment.\nCHW Programs: At risk. Certification commitment by CY2027 suggests development timeline, but deployment scale and funding remain unclear.\nCIE Platform: Existing only. NeHII provides HIE foundation, but closed-loop social care referral capability lacks dedicated investment.\nNavigation Services: Likely funded. Regional hub-and-spoke design with LHD coordinators provides navigation infrastructure.\nThe 2030 Question Nebraska’s application acknowledges sustainability concerns and includes legislative commitments extending beyond federal funding. Key questions:\nCan rural hospitals improve margins through efficiency gains, technology deployment, and care model transformation while facing potential Medicaid revenue erosion?\nWill Food as Medicine infrastructure sustain through state, agricultural sector, and school district funding after federal support ends?\nDoes “grow local” workforce strategy produce provider supply matching demand within five years, or do structural shortages persist?\nLegislative Commitments Tracker:\nCommitment Timeline CHW Certification By end of CY2027 Telehealth Parity Achieved (LB 256, 2024) Medicaid Reimbursement Achieved (LB 1087, 2024) Nebraska benefits from recent legislative momentum supporting rural health investment. Whether that momentum continues through 2030 and beyond depends on political dynamics beyond RHTP control.\nStated Priorities Versus Actual Priorities Application emphasis: Prevention, MAHA alignment, technology, agricultural integration\nFunding reality: Healthcare system stabilization likely consumes substantial funding before prevention initiatives scale\nTension point: Food as Medicine represents distinctive framing, but 60% of CAHs operating at negative margins suggests survival needs may override prevention ambitions\nReal theory of change: Technology-enabled efficiency gains must free resources for prevention investment. If efficiency gains fail to materialize, prevention initiatives face cuts.\nConclusion Nebraska’s $218.5 million award validates an application that aligned rural health transformation with agricultural identity and MAHA priorities. The Food as Medicine framing represents distinctive strategy recognizing that farming communities experiencing food deserts present both paradox and opportunity. Seven integrated initiatives address workforce, technology, access, prevention, and behavioral health comprehensively.\nThe challenge is execution amid financial distress. When nearly 60% of CAHs operate at loss and 14 counties lack any primary care physician, transformation investments compete with survival needs. Nebraska’s “grow local” workforce strategy represents appropriate philosophy for agricultural communities, but training pipelines cannot close shortages within five-year funding windows.\nSocial care integration presents mixed prospects. Food as Medicine addresses food security meaningfully, and regional navigation through LHDs provides coordination infrastructure. However, SDOH screening, CHW deployment, and CIE expansion receive minimal dedicated investment. NeHII provides existing HIE infrastructure that could support social care coordination but lacks closed-loop referral expansion funding.\nFor Nebraska’s 740,000 rural residents spread across 88 counties, RHTP represents unprecedented federal commitment to communities where “The Good Life” requires healthcare access to sustain. Whether that commitment proves sufficient depends on execution that must somehow stabilize financially distressed hospitals while simultaneously building prevention infrastructure that may not generate returns within funding timelines.\nNebraska proposed building a “prevention-first, tech-enabled sustainable rural health care system.” The first two descriptors appear achievable. The third, sustainability, depends on arithmetic that RHTP funding alone cannot guarantee.\nCross-References\nRHTP 2A: RHTP Structure and Rules RHTP 2B: Medicaid Architecture and the $911B Question RHTP 2G: MAHA Policy Alignment RHTP 2H: The 2030 Cliff RHTP 3.MT: Montana (regional comparison) RHTP 3.SD: South Dakota (regional comparison) RHTP 3.ND: North Dakota (regional comparison) Sources America’s Health Rankings. “Rural Population in Nebraska.” AmericasHealthRankings.org, 2024, www.americashealthrankings.org/explore/measures/pct_rural_b/NE.\nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services. “CMS Announces $50 Billion in Awards to Strengthen Rural Health in All 50 States.” CMS Newsroom, 29 Dec. 2025, www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-announces-50-billion-awards-strengthen-rural-health-all-50-states.\nHealth Center Association of Nebraska. “About HCAN.” HCANebraska.org, 2024, www.hcanebraska.org.\nNational Rural Health Resource Center. “Nebraska Flex Profile.” RuralCenter.org, 2024, www.ruralcenter.org/tasc/flexprofile/nebraska.\nNebraska Department of Health and Human Services. “Medicaid Expansion in Nebraska.” DHHS.ne.gov, 2025, dhhs.ne.gov/Pages/Medicaid-Expansion.aspx.\nNebraska Department of Health and Human Services. “Rural Health Transformation.” DHHS.ne.gov, 2025, dhhs.ne.gov/Pages/Rural-Health-Transformation.aspx.\nNebraska Department of Health and Human Services. “RHTP Project Narrative.” DHHS.ne.gov, Nov. 2025, dhhs.ne.gov/Documents/NE Final Project Narrative RHTP 2025.pdf.\nNebraska Department of Health and Human Services. “RHTP Project Summary.” DHHS.ne.gov, Nov. 2025, dhhs.ne.gov/Documents/NE Final Project Summary RHTP 2025.pdf.\nNebraska Hospital Association. “Roadmap for Strong Rural Health Care.” NebraskaHospitals.org, 2024, www.nebraskahospitals.org/advocacy/roadmap-to-strong-rural-health-care.html.\nNebraska Public Media. “Nebraska to Receive $218M in Rural Health Grant Funds Meant to Offset Medicaid Cuts.” NebraskaPublicMedia.org, 29 Dec. 2025, nebraskapublicmedia.org/en/news/news-articles/nebraska-to-receive-218m-in-rural-health-grant-funds-meant-to-offset-medicaid-cuts.\nRural Health Information Hub. “Nebraska Resources.” RuralHealthInfo.org, 2025, www.ruralhealthinfo.org/states/nebraska.\nSantos, Robert. “Census Director Underlines Importance of Rural America.” Nebraska Today, 20 Mar. 2024, news.unl.edu/article/census-director-underlines-importance-of-rural-america.\nRHTP 3.NE: Nebraska Series 3: State Implementation Rural Health Transformation Project Version 3: January 2026\n",

</div>

<p>Nebraska received <strong>$218.5 million in FY2026 RHTP funding</strong>, positioning it slightly above the national average of $200 million. This award reflects both the state&rsquo;s significant rural footprint and an ambitious application framing rural health transformation around food, farming, and family values.</p>
<p>The Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) proposed seven integrated initiatives designed to build what it calls a &ldquo;prevention-first, tech-enabled sustainable rural health care system.&rdquo; With 88 of 93 counties classified as rural and <strong>37% of Nebraskans living in rural areas</strong>, the state faces profound challenges: 48 counties qualify as food deserts, 52% of counties lack adequate maternity care, and nearly 60% of Critical Access Hospitals operate with negative margins.</p>
<p>Nebraska&rsquo;s five-year projected total of approximately <strong>$1.09 billion</strong> represents historic investment in agricultural communities where farming sustains the economy but healthcare infrastructure struggles to survive.</p>

<p>Nebraska spans <strong>77,000 square miles</strong> across the Great Plains, with population concentrated in the eastern metropolitan areas of Omaha and Lincoln while vast western territories remain sparsely settled. The state&rsquo;s famous Sandhills region encompasses one of the largest grass-stabilized dune systems in the Western Hemisphere, an area larger than some New England states where cattle outnumber people by orders of magnitude.</p>

<p>Nebraska&rsquo;s rural character exceeds national averages: <strong>28.1% of the state&rsquo;s total population lives in rural areas</strong> by census definition, compared to approximately 20% nationally. This concentration creates both opportunity and challenge. Rural Nebraskans maintain strong community ties and agricultural economic foundations, but population decline in smaller counties accelerates healthcare access erosion.</p>
<p>More than half of Nebraska&rsquo;s 93 counties have experienced population decline over recent decades. Douglas County (Omaha) leads with 596,000 residents, while neighboring Sarpy County shows the strongest growth. Meanwhile, Logan County has lost 16.8% of its population since 2020, and several western counties lost more than 10%.</p>

<p>Nebraska&rsquo;s healthcare challenges vary dramatically by region:</p>
<p><strong>Eastern Nebraska:</strong> The Omaha and Lincoln metropolitan areas concentrate medical resources, specialty care, and teaching hospitals. Urban residents enjoy access comparable to national averages.</p>
<p><strong>Central Nebraska:</strong> Intermediate communities like Grand Island, Hastings, and Kearney maintain regional hospital capacity but face workforce recruitment challenges.</p>
<p><strong>Western Nebraska and the Panhandle:</strong> The most profound access barriers exist here. Scottsbluff serves as the regional center for communities where <strong>55.5% of all square miles qualify as frontier and remote</strong>, defined as populations living 60+ minutes from urban areas of 50,000 or more.</p>
<p><strong>Sandhills Region:</strong> Among the most isolated healthcare environments in the continental United States. Communities may be 100+ miles from the nearest hospital, with unpaved roads and seasonal weather complications.</p>

</ul>
<p>The Native American population increased 1.7% between 2010 and 2020, and tribal health systems represent important components of the rural healthcare network. RHTP subawardees include tribal organizations (TO) as partners in regionalized access and mobile health initiatives.</p>

<p>The <strong>62 Critical Access Hospitals</strong> represent one of the highest CAH densities in the nation. Nebraska&rsquo;s rural hospitals collectively make up over 68% of all hospitals in the state, compared to 35% nationally. This infrastructure reflects historical investment in community-based healthcare, but financial sustainability remains precarious.</p>
<p><strong>CAH Network Structure:</strong> The Nebraska Flex Program utilizes five CAH networks ranging in size from 7 to 28 member hospitals. Each network includes CAHs and one larger regional or urban hospital, with network coordinators facilitating quarterly meetings to share best practices and identify technical assistance needs.</p>

<p>The Nebraska RHTP application acknowledges these facilities operate with &ldquo;thin margins due to lower volumes, high fixed costs, and payer mix challenges.&rdquo; The financial baseline resembles Montana&rsquo;s 89% negative margin rate, suggesting structural challenges extend across Great Plains states.</p>
<p>Pharmacy closures since 2020 disproportionately affected rural communities. The application notes 14% of pharmacies statewide closed, &ldquo;mostly rural,&rdquo; creating medication access gaps that compound other healthcare shortages.</p>

<p><strong>Maternity care deserts</strong> affect 52% of Nebraska counties, forcing pregnant women to travel 30+ minutes for standard prenatal care. In 2024, 4.1% of women in rural Nebraska had pre-pregnancy hypertension compared to 3.5% in urban areas, elevating preterm birth risk.</p>
<p><strong>Behavioral health access</strong> remains severely constrained. Nebraska has only two crisis stabilization centers statewide. Patients needing crisis services may travel over 4 hours for specialized care.</p>

<p>Suicide rates among rural Nebraskans exceed urban rates, and the gap continues to widen. Chronic disease prevalence connects directly to the food desert paradox: 48 of 93 counties qualify as food deserts despite Nebraska&rsquo;s agricultural abundance. Children in farming communities lack access to healthy foods even as crops and cattle surround them.</p>

<p>Nebraska&rsquo;s application integrates social determinants through food security, nutrition, and navigation rather than explicit SDOH screening infrastructure. The Food as Medicine initiative addresses social determinants through agricultural and educational partnerships rather than clinical screening protocols.</p>
<p><strong>Strengths:</strong> Food desert intervention represents meaningful SDOH investment. Agricultural sector engagement creates sustainable food access infrastructure beyond traditional healthcare.</p>
<p><strong>Gaps:</strong> No dedicated SDOH screening infrastructure investment. Provider-level HRSN implementation depends on individual facility capacity without statewide coordination.</p>

<h3 id="strengths">Strengths<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#strengths">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>MAHA Alignment:</strong> Nebraska&rsquo;s Food as Medicine initiative represents distinctive alignment with current administration health priorities. Addressing obesity (72.5% rural prevalence) through agricultural partnerships leverages the state&rsquo;s economic foundation while meeting policy expectations.</p>
<p><strong>Agricultural Integration:</strong> County Extension Offices as healthcare navigation partners represents innovative infrastructure reuse. Nebraska&rsquo;s farming communities may respond better to agricultural sector engagement than traditional healthcare outreach.</p>
<p><strong>CAH Network Density:</strong> 62 Critical Access Hospitals organized into five networks provide coordination infrastructure few states possess. The Flex Program&rsquo;s quality improvement focus and NeHII partnership demonstrate existing capacity for transformation measurement.</p>
<p><strong>Medicaid Expansion Foundation:</strong> October 2020 expansion reduced uninsurance and provides coverage foundation for transformation initiatives. Heritage Health managed care structure coordinates comprehensive benefits.</p>
<p><strong>Regional Hub-and-Spoke Design:</strong> The regionalized access initiative matches Nebraska&rsquo;s geography where concentrated resources in regional centers can extend through spoke connections to isolated communities.</p>
<p><strong>Legislative Momentum:</strong> Recent legislative wins including Medicaid reimbursement (LB 1087), telehealth parity (LB 256), and 340B protection demonstrate political environment supporting rural health investment.</p>
<h3 id="vulnerabilities">Vulnerabilities<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#vulnerabilities">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Financial Baseline:</strong> Nearly 60% of CAHs operating at negative margins mirrors regional patterns across Great Plains states. Transformation investments compete with survival needs when underlying revenue models remain broken.</p>
<p><strong>Workforce Scale:</strong> 14 counties without any primary care physician and 58 of 93 counties with family practice shortage designations represent gaps that recruitment incentives alone cannot close. The projected 5,000+ nursing shortage in 2025 suggests structural workforce crisis.</p>
<p><strong>Maternity Care Desert Extent:</strong> 52% of counties lacking adequate maternity care creates specific risk for maternal and infant outcomes. Travel distances for prenatal care in rural areas exceed safe parameters.</p>
<p><strong>Pharmacy Collapse:</strong> 69 pharmacy closures since 2020 (14% statewide) represent infrastructure loss that technology-enhanced services must overcome. Rural medication access requires solutions beyond telehealth.</p>
<p><strong>Social Care Investment Gaps:</strong> Despite Food as Medicine framing, dedicated SDOH screening infrastructure, CHW deployment, and CIE expansion receive minimal explicit funding. Existing NeHII infrastructure may remain underutilized for social care coordination.</p>
<p><strong>Behavioral Health Access:</strong> Only two crisis stabilization centers statewide and 4+ hour travel times for specialized care represent safety concerns that the Nebraska Medical Association partnership must address rapidly.</p>
<h3 id="social-care-survival-assessment">Social Care Survival Assessment<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#social-care-survival-assessment">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>SDOH/HRSN:</strong> At risk. Food as Medicine addresses food security specifically, but comprehensive SDOH screening lacks infrastructure investment.</p>
<p><strong>CHW Programs:</strong> At risk. Certification commitment by CY2027 suggests development timeline, but deployment scale and funding remain unclear.</p>
<p><strong>CIE Platform:</strong> Existing only. NeHII provides HIE foundation, but closed-loop social care referral capability lacks dedicated investment.</p>
<p><strong>Navigation Services:</strong> Likely funded. Regional hub-and-spoke design with LHD coordinators provides navigation infrastructure.</p>

<p>Nebraska benefits from recent legislative momentum supporting rural health investment. Whether that momentum continues through 2030 and beyond depends on political dynamics beyond RHTP control.</p>
<h3 id="stated-priorities-versus-actual-priorities">Stated Priorities Versus Actual Priorities<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#stated-priorities-versus-actual-priorities">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Application emphasis:</strong> Prevention, MAHA alignment, technology, agricultural integration</p>
<p><strong>Funding reality:</strong> Healthcare system stabilization likely consumes substantial funding before prevention initiatives scale</p>
<p><strong>Tension point:</strong> Food as Medicine represents distinctive framing, but 60% of CAHs operating at negative margins suggests survival needs may override prevention ambitions</p>
<p><strong>Real theory of change:</strong> Technology-enabled efficiency gains must free resources for prevention investment. If efficiency gains fail to materialize, prevention initiatives face cuts.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>Nebraska&rsquo;s $218.5 million award validates an application that aligned rural health transformation with agricultural identity and MAHA priorities. The Food as Medicine framing represents distinctive strategy recognizing that farming communities experiencing food deserts present both paradox and opportunity. Seven integrated initiatives address workforce, technology, access, prevention, and behavioral health comprehensively.</p>
<p>The challenge is execution amid financial distress. When nearly 60% of CAHs operate at loss and 14 counties lack any primary care physician, transformation investments compete with survival needs. Nebraska&rsquo;s &ldquo;grow local&rdquo; workforce strategy represents appropriate philosophy for agricultural communities, but training pipelines cannot close shortages within five-year funding windows.</p>
<p>Social care integration presents mixed prospects. Food as Medicine addresses food security meaningfully, and regional navigation through LHDs provides coordination infrastructure. However, SDOH screening, CHW deployment, and CIE expansion receive minimal dedicated investment. NeHII provides existing HIE infrastructure that could support social care coordination but lacks closed-loop referral expansion funding.</p>
<p>For Nebraska&rsquo;s 740,000 rural residents spread across 88 counties, RHTP represents unprecedented federal commitment to communities where &ldquo;The Good Life&rdquo; requires healthcare access to sustain. <strong>Whether that commitment proves sufficient depends on execution that must somehow stabilize financially distressed hospitals while simultaneously building prevention infrastructure that may not generate returns within funding timelines.</strong></p>
<p>Nebraska proposed building a &ldquo;prevention-first, tech-enabled sustainable rural health care system.&rdquo; The first two descriptors appear achievable. The third, sustainability, depends on arithmetic that RHTP funding alone cannot guarantee.</p>
