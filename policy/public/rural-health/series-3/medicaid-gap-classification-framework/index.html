  "articleBody": "This technical document provides a classification framework for analyzing state Medicaid contexts and how those contexts shape Rural Health Transformation Program (RHTP) implementation. The framework enables systematic comparison of state positions across expansion status, coverage gaps, and the interaction between projected Medicaid cuts and RHTP investment.\nRHTP operates within a Medicaid policy environment that simultaneously undermines its goals. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act created RHTP alongside $911 billion in Medicaid cuts over ten years. This document quantifies that mismatch at the state level and classifies states by their net fiscal position.\nPart I: Expansion Status Classification State Classification by Medicaid Expansion Status As of January 2026, 40 states and the District of Columbia have adopted Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. Ten states have not adopted expansion, creating coverage gaps that RHTP cannot address.\nClassification States Count Full Expansion AK, AZ, AR, CA, CO, CT, DE, HI, IL, IN, IA, KS, KY, LA, ME, MD, MA, MI, MN, MO, MT, NE, NV, NH, NJ, NM, NY, NC, ND, OH, OK, OR, PA, RI, SD, UT, VT, VA, WA, WV, DC 41 Partial Expansion (Work Requirements) GA 1 Limited Expansion (Waiver) WI 1 Non-Expansion AL, FL, KS, MS, SC, TN, TX, WY 8 Note: Kansas enacted expansion in 2025 with implementation pending. Georgia operates Georgia Pathways with work requirements since 2023. Wisconsin provides coverage to 100% FPL through waiver but does not receive enhanced FMAP and is classified as non-expansion by CMS.\nExpansion Timeline Categories Category Definition States Original Expansion (2014) Implemented at ACA launch AZ, AR, CA, CO, CT, DE, HI, IL, IA, KY, MD, MA, MN, NV, NJ, NM, NY, ND, OH, OR, RI, VT, WA, WV, DC Early Expansion (2015-2019) Adopted within five years of ACA AK, IN, LA, ME, MT, NH, PA, VA Recent Expansion (2020-2023) Adopted in last three years ID, MO, NE, NC, OK, SD, UT Pending/Partial Not fully implemented GA, KS Non-Expansion No expansion adopted AL, FL, MS, SC, TN, TX, WI, WY Expansion timing affects RHTP implementation capacity. Recent expansion states built coverage infrastructure assuming 90% federal support. Enhanced FMAP reduction to 70% by 2031 creates fiscal exposure that did not exist when expansion was approved. North Carolina (expanded December 2023) exemplifies this vulnerability.\nPart II: Coverage Gap Analysis Coverage Gap Population by State The coverage gap exists in states that have not expanded Medicaid. Adults with incomes above state Medicaid eligibility thresholds but below 100% of the Federal Poverty Level are ineligible for both Medicaid and ACA Marketplace subsidies.\nState Coverage Gap Population % of National Gap Rural Concentration Texas 580,000 42% High (border, rural regions) Florida 260,000 19% Moderate Georgia 190,000 14% High (Black Belt, rural South) Tennessee 85,000 6% High (Appalachia, rural West TN) Alabama 75,000 5% High (Black Belt, rural) Mississippi 65,000 5% Very High (Delta, Black Belt) South Carolina 55,000 4% High (rural Lowcountry, Pee Dee) Wyoming 10,000 \u003c1% Very High (frontier) Wisconsin 0 0% N/A (waiver provides coverage to 100% FPL) Total ~1,400,000 100% Disproportionately rural Source: KFF analysis of American Community Survey data, February 2025\nCoverage Gap Demographic Profile Characteristic Coverage Gap Population General Population People of Color 64% 44% Working Adults 60%+ in working families N/A Adults Without Children 80% N/A Rural Residents Disproportionately high N/A Self-Employed Disproportionately high N/A Texas, Florida, and Georgia account for 75% of the national coverage gap population. These three states contain large rural populations where RHTP investment occurs alongside persistent coverage gaps that transformation funding cannot address.\nPart III: RHTP and Medicaid Cut Interaction The Fundamental Mismatch The One Big Beautiful Bill Act created RHTP and cut Medicaid simultaneously. Multiple analyses quantify the gap between cuts and investment:\nAnalysis Source Rural Medicaid Reduction (10-year) RHTP Investment (5-year) Gap KFF $137 to $155 billion $50 billion $87 to $105 billion Manatt/NRHA $58 billion (hospitals only) $50 billion $8 billion minimum AHA $50.4 billion (hospitals only) $50 billion Effectively zero offset Center for American Progress Variable by facility $4.5M per hospital (if equal) Facility-level losses exceed RHTP The arithmetic does not work. NRHA’s Carrie Cochran-McClain stated: “When you put that up against the $50 billion for the Rural Health Transformation Fund, you know, that math does not add up.”\nTiming Mismatch The gap analysis understates the problem because RHTP front-loads funding while Medicaid cuts back-load impact.\nPeriod RHTP Status Medicaid Cut Status FY2026-2030 $10 billion annually distributed Work requirements phase in FY2027; per capita caps tighten Post-FY2030 RHTP ends 64% of ten-year Medicaid reductions occur after FY2030 FY2031+ No transformation funding FMAP reduction to 70% fully implemented; steepest cuts arrive States receive temporary RHTP support before permanent Medicaid austerity arrives.\nFMAP Reduction Schedule The enhanced Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) for Medicaid expansion populations decreases from 90% to 70% over five years:\nFiscal Year Federal Match for Expansion Adults Current (FY2025) 90% FY2027 85% FY2028 80% FY2029 75% FY2030 72% FY2031+ 70% The 20-percentage-point reduction shifts billions in costs to states. States must either increase state spending to maintain coverage or reduce enrollment and benefits. Given state budget constraints, coverage reduction is the likely outcome in most states.\nPart IV: Medicaid Gap Classification Schema Classification Definitions The Medicaid Gap measures the difference between projected Medicaid spending reductions and RHTP allocations at the state level. Classification considers both absolute gap size and state fiscal capacity.\nClassification Definition Fiscal Implications Positive RHTP meets or exceeds annualized Medicaid cuts Transformation proceeds without Medicaid offset pressure Low Gap under $500M annually Manageable with state resources; transformation viable Moderate Gap $500M to $2B annually Significant strain; triage decisions required Severe Gap $2B to $5B annually Critical infrastructure threat; coverage contraction likely Extreme Gap over $5B annually Systemic collapse risk; RHTP insufficient for basic maintenance State Classifications Classification States Characteristics Positive AK, VT, ND, SD, WY Small populations, favorable RHTP formula treatment, limited Medicaid dependency Low WV, OK, MT Expansion states with moderate populations; RHTP provides meaningful buffer Moderate KY, AR, NC, MO, LA, OH, IN, MI, WI, MN, IA, NE, KS, CO, UT, NM, NV, OR, WA, ID, ME, NH, RI, CT, DE, MD, VA, HI Expansion states with significant rural populations; FMAP reduction creates fiscal pressure but coverage infrastructure exists Severe MS, GA, TN, AL, SC Non-expansion status (except GA partial); hospital closure rates among highest nationally; persistent poverty concentration Extreme TX, CA, NY, PA, IL, FL Large rural populations, high Medicaid enrollment, significant provider tax reliance; scale magnifies gap State Detail: Medicaid Gap Classification State RHTP FY2026 Medicaid Gap Class Expansion Status Coverage Gap Pop. Hospital Risk Texas $281.3M Extreme Non-Expansion 580,000 82 (54%) California $233.6M Extreme Expansion N/A Moderate New York $212.1M Extreme Expansion N/A Moderate Pennsylvania $193.3M Extreme Expansion N/A Moderate Illinois $193.4M Extreme Expansion N/A Moderate Florida $209.9M Extreme Non-Expansion 260,000 Moderate Mississippi $205.9M Severe Non-Expansion 65,000 28 (49%) Georgia $218.9M Severe Partial (work req.) 190,000 22 (30%) Tennessee $206.9M Severe Non-Expansion 85,000 16 (44%) Alabama $203.4M Severe Non-Expansion 75,000 Moderate South Carolina $200.0M Severe Non-Expansion 55,000 31-40% Kentucky $212.9M Moderate Expansion (2014) N/A Moderate Arkansas $208.8M Moderate Expansion (2014) N/A 50% at risk North Carolina $213.0M Moderate Expansion (2023) N/A 12 closures Ohio $202.0M Moderate Expansion (2014) N/A Moderate Missouri $216.3M Moderate Expansion (2021) N/A 10 closures Louisiana $208.4M Moderate Expansion (2016) N/A Moderate Oklahoma $223.5M Low Expansion (2021) N/A 23 (34%) West Virginia $199.5M Low Expansion (2014) N/A 5 closures Montana $233.5M Low Expansion (2016) N/A Low Alaska $272.2M Positive Expansion (2015) N/A Low Vermont $195.1M Positive Expansion (2014) N/A Low North Dakota $198.9M Positive Expansion (2014) N/A Low South Dakota $189.5M Positive Expansion (2023) N/A 26-30% Wyoming $205.0M Positive Non-Expansion 10,000 Low Part V: Per-Capita Medicaid Spending Baseline State Medicaid Spending Context State Medicaid per-enrollee spending provides baseline for understanding RHTP investment proportionality:\nSpending Tier States Per-Enrollee Spending RHTP Implication High AK, NY, CT, MA, VT, ND $12,000+ RHTP supplements robust existing system Above Average CA, NJ, NH, MN, WY, RI $9,000 to $12,000 Transformation builds on adequate base Average PA, IL, OH, MI, WA, OR, CO $7,000 to $9,000 RHTP addresses moderate gaps Below Average TX, FL, GA, NC, VA, AZ $5,500 to $7,000 RHTP cannot offset underfunding Low AL, MS, TN, SC, AR, LA Under $5,500 RHTP insufficient for baseline adequacy States with low Medicaid per-enrollee spending often have both coverage gaps and inadequate provider reimbursement. RHTP investment in these states faces compounding structural disadvantages.\nPart VI: Provider Financial Exposure Rural Hospital Medicaid Revenue Dependency Rural hospitals depend on Medicaid revenue at varying rates, creating differential exposure to cuts:\nDependency Level Definition Risk Profile Critical \u003e40% of net patient revenue from Medicaid Extreme closure risk under cuts High 30-40% Medicaid revenue Severe financial stress likely Moderate 20-30% Medicaid revenue Significant but survivable with transformation Low \u003c20% Medicaid revenue Manageable exposure; RHTP can focus on transformation Exposure by State Type State Category Typical Hospital Medicaid Dependency Cut Impact Non-Expansion States 15-25% (lower enrollment) High uncompensated care; closures accelerate Recent Expansion States 25-35% (building enrollment) FMAP reduction creates fiscal cliff Established Expansion States 30-40% (mature enrollment) Gradual cost shift to states Non-expansion states present a paradox. Lower Medicaid dependency appears protective, but high uncompensated care burdens create equivalent or greater financial stress. Hospitals in non-expansion states already experience higher closure rates despite lower Medicaid revenue percentages.\nCritical Access Hospital Exposure Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs) face particular vulnerability:\nMetric Value Source CAHs with negative margins 47% HRSA FY2024 CAHs at financial risk 432 nationwide Chartis 2025 Average CAH Medicaid margin Negative $200,000 to $500,000 Rural hospital analysis Medicaid pays less than cost at most CAHs. Unlike Medicare cost-based reimbursement, Medicaid rates vary by state and typically reimburse 60-80% of actual costs. Cuts to already inadequate payments compound losses.\nPart VII: State Classifications for Analytical Use Classification Schema Application The following schema enables consistent state classification across Series 3 articles:\nDimension Categories Application Expansion Status Full, Partial, Limited, Non-Expansion Determines coverage gap presence Expansion Timing Original, Early, Recent, Pending, None Affects infrastructure maturity Medicaid Gap Class Positive, Low, Moderate, Severe, Extreme Primary risk stratification Coverage Gap Population None, Small (\u003c50K), Moderate (50-150K), Large (\u003e150K) Quantifies uninsured burden Provider Exposure Low, Moderate, High, Critical Financial vulnerability assessment State Profile Template Each Series 3 state profile should document:\nMedicaid Context Block\nExpansion Status: [Full/Partial/Limited/Non-Expansion]\rExpansion Date: [Year or N/A]\rMedicaid Gap Classification: [Positive/Low/Moderate/Severe/Extreme]\rCoverage Gap Population: [Number or N/A]\rEnhanced FMAP Exposure: [Yes/No/Partial]\rProvider Medicaid Dependency: [Percentage range] Cross-Reference Matrix Medicaid Gap Class Typical Expansion Status Coverage Gap RHTP Strategy Implication Positive Expansion None Transformation focused; adequate resources Low Expansion None Transformation with buffer; sustainability achievable Moderate Expansion None Triage required; social care vulnerable Severe Mixed Large Coverage advocacy essential; RHTP insufficient Extreme Mixed Varies Crisis management; transformation secondary Part VIII: Projected Coverage Loss Estimates Work Requirements Impact CBO estimates 7.5 million people will lose Medicaid coverage by 2034 due to work requirements. Rural areas face disproportionate impact:\nBarrier Rural Prevalence Expected Impact Documentation challenges High (agricultural, gig work) Higher disenrollment rates Seasonal employment High (farming, tourism) Compliance gaps during off-seasons Transportation barriers High (no public transit) Inability to reach verification appointments Childcare unavailability High Cannot work without childcare Coverage Loss Projections by State Category State Category Projected Coverage Loss RHTP Offset Capacity Non-Expansion N/A (no expansion population) None (coverage gap persists) Recent Expansion 15-25% of expansion population Minimal; FMAP reduction compounds Established Expansion 10-20% of expansion population Limited; administrative churning AHA Rural Coverage Projection The American Hospital Association projects 1.8 million rural residents will lose coverage by 2034 under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. This population loss compounds provider financial exposure, creating demand reduction during revenue contraction.\nMethodology Notes Data Sources Primary Sources\nCMS Medicaid enrollment data and state plan information KFF Status of State Medicaid Expansion Decisions (updated January 2026) Congressional Budget Office scoring of H.R. 1 (One Big Beautiful Bill Act) American Hospital Association Medicaid cut impact analyses Kaiser Family Foundation coverage gap estimates Center on Budget and Policy Priorities state analyses Secondary Sources\nPenn LDI state funding comparison analyses Manatt Health analyses for National Rural Health Association State Medicaid agency budget documents Rural hospital financial data (HCRIS, Chartis) Limitations Classification limitations include:\nMedicaid gap classifications rely on estimates subject to policy implementation variation Coverage gap populations represent point-in-time estimates; actual numbers fluctuate Provider exposure percentages represent ranges; facility-level variation is significant Projected coverage losses depend on work requirement implementation details not yet finalized Formula limitations include:\nRHTP-to-Medicaid gap ratio does not account for non-Medicaid revenue sources Per-capita calculations use varying rural population definitions across sources Hospital risk classifications use different methodologies by source Update Schedule This document requires revision when:\nStates change Medicaid expansion status CMS updates FMAP reduction implementation timeline New coverage loss projections become available RHTP annual awards alter state positions Work requirement regulations finalize implementation details Related Technical Documents Document Title Function 2-TD-A RHTP Funding Formula Methodology Award calculations and state allocations 2-TD-B Federal Rural Health Program Coordination Matrix Program overlap and coordination 3-TD-A State Award Comparison Matrix Multi-metric state ranking 3-TD-B Per-Capita Funding Analysis Scale penalty examination 3-TD-C Medicaid Gap Classification Framework This document 3-TD-D Program and Subawardee Registry Funding distribution tracking Sources American Hospital Association. “Rural Hospital Impact Analysis of Medicaid Provisions in H.R. 1.” AHA, March 2025.\nCenter on Budget and Policy Priorities. “Closing Medicaid Coverage Gap Would Provide Over 1.5 Million Uninsured Adults Path to Affordable Health Coverage.” CBPP, 10 Apr. 2025, www.cbpp.org/research/health/closing-medicaid-coverage-gap.\nCongressional Budget Office. “Information Concerning Budgetary Effects of H.R. 1.” CBO, 2025.\nKaiser Family Foundation. “5 Key Facts About Medicaid Expansion.” KFF, 25 Apr. 2025, www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/5-key-facts-about-medicaid-expansion/.\nKaiser Family Foundation. “How Many Uninsured Are in the Coverage Gap and How Many Could be Eligible if All States Adopted the Medicaid Expansion?” KFF, 25 Feb. 2025, www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/how-many-uninsured-are-in-the-coverage-gap/.\nKaiser Family Foundation. “Status of State Medicaid Expansion Decisions.” KFF, Jan. 2026, www.kff.org/medicaid/status-of-state-medicaid-expansion-decisions/.\nManatt Health. “Rural Hospital Medicaid Funding Impact Analysis.” Prepared for National Rural Health Association, 2025.\nPenn Leonard Davis Institute. “Rural Health Transformation Program Funding Distribution Analysis.” LDI, 2025.\nTechnical Document 3-TD-C Series 3: State Implementation Rural Health Transformation Project Version 1.0 | January 2026\n",

<p>This technical document provides a <strong>classification framework for analyzing state Medicaid contexts</strong> and how those contexts shape Rural Health Transformation Program (RHTP) implementation. The framework enables systematic comparison of state positions across expansion status, coverage gaps, and the interaction between projected Medicaid cuts and RHTP investment.</p>
<p><strong>RHTP operates within a Medicaid policy environment that simultaneously undermines its goals.</strong> The One Big Beautiful Bill Act created RHTP alongside $911 billion in Medicaid cuts over ten years. This document quantifies that mismatch at the state level and classifies states by their net fiscal position.</p>

<p>Expansion timing affects RHTP implementation capacity. <strong>Recent expansion states</strong> built coverage infrastructure assuming 90% federal support. Enhanced FMAP reduction to 70% by 2031 creates fiscal exposure that <strong>did not exist when expansion was approved</strong>. North Carolina (expanded December 2023) exemplifies this vulnerability.</p>

<li>Medicaid gap classifications rely on estimates subject to policy implementation variation</li>
<li>Coverage gap populations represent point-in-time estimates; actual numbers fluctuate</li>
<li>Provider exposure percentages represent ranges; facility-level variation is significant</li>
<li>Projected coverage losses depend on work requirement implementation details not yet finalized</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Formula limitations include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>RHTP-to-Medicaid gap ratio does not account for non-Medicaid revenue sources</li>
<li>Per-capita calculations use varying rural population definitions across sources</li>
<li>Hospital risk classifications use different methodologies by source</li>
