  "articleBody": "January 2026\nRhode Island received $156,169,931 in RHTP funding for FY2026, ranking 45th nationally and landing among the lowest allocations alongside Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, Maryland, and New Jersey. For the nation’s smallest state, this positioning reflects structural formula mechanics that reward geographic vastness over concentrated rural need. Rhode Island’s rural challenges operate at a scale that defies conventional rural health frameworks, requiring solutions calibrated to microgeographies where isolation means ferry dependency rather than empty highways.\nThe state submitted an ambitious $1 billion application across 13 interconnected initiatives. Receiving approximately 16% of that request forces prioritization among competing transformation objectives. What emerges is a strategy that treats Rhode Island’s unique conditions, including island isolation, tribal sovereignty, coastal fragmentation, and seasonal population volatility, as design constraints requiring innovation rather than limitations preventing participation.\nState Context The Geography of Compressed Distance\nRhode Island spans just 1,034 square miles of land area, making it the smallest state in the nation by a substantial margin. The entire state could fit inside a single Montana ranch with acreage to spare. Yet within this compressed geography lies a complexity of peninsulas, bays, bridges, and islands that fragments proximity into practical isolation.\nThe state’s coastal and island topography defies the assumption that small states lack rural health challenges. Block Island sits 12 miles offshore in the Atlantic, accessible only by ferry or small aircraft. Prudence Island in Narragansett Bay requires boat transport. Communities along Rhode Island’s western border with Connecticut experience limited access despite their relative closeness to urban centers. What matters is not distance measured in miles but accessibility measured in travel time, cost, and seasonal reliability.\nDefinitional Complexity and Its Consequences\nRhode Island illustrates the definitional tensions that complicate rural health policy nationwide. The federal HRSA definition used in RHTP workload calculations identifies only 2 towns and 24,147 residents as rural, specifically Block Island (New Shoreham) and Westerly. This narrow definition creates a statistical artifact where Rhode Island appears to have minimal rural health needs.\nThe Rhode Island State Office of Rural Health employs a broader definition accepted by HRSA for state planning purposes. This framework encompasses 18 towns with 195,809 residents, representing 17.9% of the state’s 1.1 million population. These communities share average population density of 314 persons per square mile, well below the nearly 2,200 per square mile observed in non-rural areas. The 18 rural towns include:\nCounty Rural Towns Providence County Burrillville, North Smithfield, Foster, Glocester, Scituate, Smithfield Kent County East Greenwich, West Greenwich Washington County Charlestown, Exeter, Hopkinton, New Shoreham (Block Island), Richmond, Westerly Newport County Jamestown, Little Compton, Portsmouth, Tiverton Using the state definition, Rhode Island’s RHTP allocation calculates to approximately $797 per rural resident annually. Using the federal definition produces an astronomical per-capita figure that distorts comparative analysis. This definitional gap, a factor of nearly 10 in population covered, shapes every aspect of implementation planning.\nDemographics: Older, Vulnerable, and Seasonal\nRhode Island’s rural population skews older and more economically vulnerable than non-rural counterparts. Adults aged 65 and older comprise 23% of the rural population compared to 17% in non-rural areas. This demographic pattern mirrors national trends but intensifies in communities where younger residents have migrated to urban employment centers.\nNearly 13% of rural Rhode Island residents have incomes below 200% of the federal poverty level, and 5.4% have less than a high school diploma. Employment patterns diverge from urban areas: rural residents work disproportionately in construction and agriculture/fishing, industries that often lack employer-sponsored health insurance.\nThe seasonal dimension compounds demographic challenges. Many rural communities are popular tourist destinations where population temporarily doubles or triples during peak summer months. Local healthcare infrastructure must surge to meet tourist demand, then contract as visitors depart. Seasonal housing accounts for nearly 10% of rural units statewide, reaching nearly a quarter of homes in Block Island and Westerly. This housing pressure raises living costs, forcing healthcare workers to commute long distances or relocate entirely.\nHealth Disparities That Persist Despite Proximity\nRhode Island’s rural residents experience measurably worse health outcomes than their non-rural neighbors. Adults in rural areas have a 15% higher rate of hypertension (36% vs. 31%), a 28% higher rate of cardiovascular disease (16% vs. 13%), and a 15% higher rate of tobacco use. The rural suicide rate is 32% higher than in non-rural areas (13.0 deaths per 100,000 compared to 9.8).\nProvider availability represents the most significant barrier. The availability of primary care physicians in rural areas is 37% lower than in non-rural areas (0.59 per 1,000 population compared to 0.94). Rural areas have only 0.34 FTE per 1,000 Medicaid enrollees compared to 0.48 in non-rural areas. Parts of Providence and Washington Counties are designated Primary Care Health Professional Shortage Areas.\nAccess to psychiatric care is especially limited. All of Newport and Washington Counties, plus part of Providence County, are designated mental health professional shortage areas. Rural areas have only 0.02 FTE psychiatrists per 1,000 residents compared to 0.34 in non-rural areas, a 95% difference. Based on recent claims data, no psychiatrists accepting Medicaid practice in any of the 18 rural towns.\nHealthcare Infrastructure: Fragile but Functioning The Sole Rural Hospital\nRhode Island has only one acute care hospital in a rural area: Westerly Hospital. This facility operates with a negative operating margin, the lowest in the state. Westerly Hospital joined Yale New Haven Health in 2016, providing system affiliation but not resolving fundamental financial pressures inherent to rural hospital operation.\nThe state has zero Critical Access Hospitals, zero Rural Emergency Hospitals, and one Rural Health Clinic (Block Island Health Services). This infrastructure absence reflects Rhode Island’s geographic compression rather than healthcare strength. Federal rural designation criteria designed for Montana and Alaska do not map onto Rhode Island’s conditions.\nBlock Island’s Extreme Isolation\nBlock Island (Town of New Shoreham) represents Rhode Island’s most geographically isolated community. Approximately 1,100 year-round residents live 12 miles offshore, dependent on ferry service that weather can disrupt for days. During peak summer months, daily population surges to over 30,000 people, a more than 25-fold increase driven by tourists, seasonal homeowners, and day-trippers.\nThe Block Island Health Services facility operates as the island’s only medical resource, including the state’s sole Rural Health Clinic. There are no rural birthing facilities anywhere in Rhode Island; Block Island residents requiring labor and delivery must travel to the mainland.\nThe Narragansett Indian Tribe\nThe Narragansett Indian Tribe, Rhode Island’s only federally recognized tribe, operates the Narragansett Indian Health Center (NIHC) in the Charlestown area. This facility delivers primary, behavioral, and community health services to tribal members, operating under distinct federal frameworks that require government-to-government coordination rather than state direction.\nTribal members face persistent health disparities exceeding those of non-tribal rural residents. Access to dental, specialty, and diagnostic care remains limited due to transportation barriers, outdated infrastructure, and incomplete integration of tribal health data within statewide systems. Specialty care coverage for tribal members is currently very limited, underscoring the need for expanded local capacity through RHTP investment.\nMedicaid Context\nRhode Island expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act and maintains the HUSKY Health program covering approximately 1.1 million residents. Expansion provides coverage for populations that in non-expansion states would remain uninsured, strengthening rural provider financial stability through expanded patient coverage.\nHowever, Medicaid reimbursement rates remain challenging for rural providers. The higher concentration of Medicaid and Medicare patients in rural areas contributes to financial pressures that have constrained service expansion. The impending H.R. 1 Medicaid cuts create legitimate concern for providers operating on already thin margins.\nRHTP Application and Award Lead Agency and Governance\nThe Rhode Island Executive Office of Health and Human Services (EOHHS) serves as lead agency under Secretary Richard Charest, with Assistant Secretary Ana Novais and Interim RHTP Director Manuel Ortiz coordinating implementation. EOHHS functions as the single State Medicaid agency and implementation lead for the CMS AHEAD model, positioning it to integrate RHTP resources with existing transformation initiatives.\nThe governance structure involves multiple tiers:\nStructure Composition Function Executive Committee Governor’s Office, EOHHS Secretary, RIDOH Director, Health Insurance Commissioner, OMB Director, DOA Director Strategic oversight and policy direction Interagency Leadership Team Cabinet members and senior staff from BHDDH, DCYF, DHS, EOHHS, OHA, OVS, OHIC, DLT, RIDE, RIDOH, OMB, OPC, DOA Coordination and resource alignment Project Management Team EOHHS Project Director, Finance Director, Project Managers Day-to-day operations and compliance Rural Stakeholder Advisory Committee Patients, residents, rural organizations, providers, tribal leadership Community engagement and implementation input This multi-tiered architecture reflects Rhode Island’s compact governance advantage: the entire state health system fits within coordinating distance, enabling integration impossible in larger states.\nTechnical Score and Award Analysis\nRhode Island received approximately $56 million above the $100 million equal distribution baseline, suggesting modest technical score performance. The state’s limited geographic rurality under federal definitions constrained discretionary allocation competitiveness regardless of application quality.\nThe state requested $1 billion over five years across 13 initiatives. Receiving $156 million for FY2026 (approximately 16% of annualized request) forces difficult prioritization. The request-to-award gap is among the largest percentage shortfalls nationally, reflecting formula mechanics that penalize states with small land areas regardless of rural population concentration or health severity.\nProgram Allocation and Initiatives Rhode Island organized its 13 initiatives across five strategic goals:\nInitiative Strategic Goal 5-Year Request Key Focus 1. Integrated Rural Population Health Infrastructure Improve Health $80,007,241 Community Clinical Care Hubs, Rural Community Health Networks 2. Community-Integrated and Mobile Health Services Improve Health $40,612,561 Mobile clinics, school-based telehealth, Community Learning Centers 3. Expanding Access to Rural Community Resources Improve Health $11,341,370 Accessibility upgrades for people with disabilities and elderly 4. Rural EMS Health Access and Integration Expand Access $47,342,420 Mobile Integrated Health-Community Paramedicine, EMS Academy 5. Rural Hospital-at-Home Program Expand Access $74,979,026 Acute care in patient homes as hospital alternative 6. Expanding Behavioral Health Services Expand Access $55,334,170 Crisis stabilization centers, Recovery Community Centers, SUD bridge clinics 7. Strengthening Rural Oral Health Expand Access $8,918,286 Virtual dental triage, specialized dental center at Zambarano 8. Block Island Health Capacity Expand Access $7,270,520 PACE program, Community Medicine Program, EMS upgrades 9. Narragansett Indian Tribe Health Expand Access $3,835,300 Telehealth, infrastructure modernization, workforce support 10. Rural Workforce Program Workforce $250,761,602 Residency programs, recruitment incentives, training pipelines 11. Value-Based Payment Transition Innovative Care $180,000,000 Hospital and primary care APM support, transformation funds 12. Rural HIT Modernization Tech Innovation $140,000,000 State-sponsored EHR, infrastructure grants 13. Rural Health Data and Workforce Tracking Improve Health $8,500,000 Data hub enhancement, community health profiles Social Care Integration\nRhode Island embeds social care components throughout its initiative structure rather than isolating them as standalone programs.\nComponent Integration Approach Status SDOH/HRSN Community Clinical Care Hubs coordinate clinical and social services through care teams including CHWs addressing barriers like transportation and social needs Embedded in Initiative 1 Community Health Workers CHWs serve as essential Hub care team members conducting preventive screenings, facilitating referrals, coordinating services across clinical and community settings Funded through multiple initiatives Community Information Exchange Rural HIT Modernization (Initiative 12) includes referral and coordination platforms linking healthcare and social services Procurement pending Technology Vendors State-sponsored EHR solution to aggregate demand across rural practices; infrastructure grants for telehealth and remote monitoring Procurement pending FY2026 Initiative Highlights\nCommunity Clinical Care Hubs and Networks (Initiative 1) form the operational backbone. Hubs provide integrated primary care, specialty care, behavioral health, oral health, and pharmacy services through multidisciplinary care teams. Networks mobilize local partners including schools, libraries, and community organizations to develop coordinated improvement strategies. This distributed model reflects Rhode Island’s fragmented geography where fixed clinic locations cannot serve dispersed populations efficiently.\nHospital-at-Home (Initiative 5) leverages Rhode Island’s compact geography as an asset. Unlike states where home-based acute care faces logistical impossibility due to distance, Rhode Island can realistically deploy clinical teams to patient homes for conditions like COPD exacerbations, pneumonia, cellulitis, and post-operative monitoring. The initiative coordinates with enhanced EMS capabilities and Hub care coordination systems.\nBlock Island Capacity Building (Initiative 8) addresses the state’s most isolated community through integrated strategies: establishing the island’s first PACE (Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly) program in partnership with PACE Rhode Island, expanding the Community Medicine Program for home-based preventive and follow-up care, deploying a full-time Community Health Worker, and modernizing EMS infrastructure including marine transport capabilities.\nValue-Based Payment Transition (Initiative 11) represents Rhode Island’s largest single initiative by request ($180 million) and aligns with the state’s participation in CMS’s AHEAD (Achieving Healthcare Efficiency through Accountable Design) model. The initiative supports hospitals and primary care practices in transitioning to State-approved advanced alternative payment models through incentive payments, technical assistance, and transformation grants.\nStakeholder Engagement Rhode Island conducted extensive community engagement throughout application development:\nTwo statewide virtual Community Listening Sessions Three hybrid Listening Sessions: Block Island, southern Rhode Island (Washington County), northern Rhode Island (Burrillville) More than 20 public meetings and community forums Online Community Feedback Request generating over 300 survey responses Outreach reaching approximately 1,200 individuals Community listening sessions identified common barriers:\nWorkforce emerged as central concern. Primary and behavioral health clinicians concentrate in urban centers, forcing rural residents to travel long distances. Provider shortages result in long wait times. Access to home and community-based services is restricted by waiting lists, reimbursement limitations, and geographic isolation.\nTransportation compounds access barriers. Residents living on islands or across bridges indicated that routine appointments create significant logistical burdens.\nTechnology challenges pressure rural practices. Providers struggle to adopt interoperable EHR systems due to high upfront costs, limited IT support, and inconsistent broadband connectivity. These barriers contribute to independent practice consolidation into larger health systems less responsive to local community needs.\nPolicy Commitments Rhode Island committed to specific policy actions to maximize RHTP impact:\nPolicy Area Current Status Commitment Licensure Compacts Member of Interstate Medical Licensure Compact and Nursing Licensure Compact; PSYPACT member Join PA Compact by December 2027 Certificate of Need CON laws regulate facility development and major capital expenditures Enact legislation reducing CON restrictiveness by December 2027 Scope of Practice Full scope for NPs; moderate for PAs; restricted for pharmacists; semi-restricted for dental hygienists Expand scope for pharmacists and dental hygienists by December 2027 Nutrition CME No requirement for nutrition in physician continuing medical education Enact legislation requiring nutrition CME by December 2028 Telehealth Medicaid covers remote care services Maintain and expand coverage These commitments respond to RHTP technical score factors while aligning with state workforce development priorities.\nSustainability Considerations The 2030 Question\nRhode Island’s sustainability strategy centers on embedding RHTP initiatives within existing systems and transitioning to ongoing funding mechanisms:\nFinancial Sustainability: Many investments represent one-time infrastructure costs (mobile clinics, EHR systems, facility upgrades) that create capacity sustained through subsequent service reimbursement. Hospital-at-Home, MIH-CP services, and Crisis Stabilization Centers will transition to Medicaid, Medicare, and commercial payer coverage after initial implementation.\nAHEAD Alignment: Value-based payment transformation (Initiative 11) provides the economic logic: if hospitals and primary care practices successfully transition to global budgets and advanced APMs by 2030, reformed payment models sustain transformed practices without ongoing RHTP-style grants.\nOperational Integration: Programs are designed to build on existing entities (FQHCs, hospitals, EMS agencies, community organizations) ensuring that RHTP functions become integrated into standard operating procedures.\nWhat Survives Partial Funding\nGiven Rhode Island received approximately 16% of its request, prioritization will determine which initiatives proceed at full scope:\nLikely Preserved: Infrastructure investments (EHR, mobile clinics, accessibility upgrades), Block Island capacity building, Narragansett Tribe modernization, EMS Academy establishment\nUncertain: Full Hub and Network deployment across all 18 towns, comprehensive workforce incentive programs, complete Hospital-at-Home scaling\nAt Risk: Recovery Community Center expansion, some behavioral health facility construction, full HIT infrastructure grant scope\nAnalysis and Assessment Strengths\nRhode Island’s approach demonstrates strategic coherence in treating geographic compression as an implementation advantage rather than policy disqualifier. The state’s compact scale enables coordination, governance integration, and service delivery models (Hospital-at-Home, mobile integrated health) that would face logistical impossibility in larger states.\nThe AHEAD model alignment provides sustainability logic missing from many state applications. Rhode Island articulates clear sequencing: use RHTP resources to prepare providers for value-based care, then sustain transformation through reformed payment structures.\nAttention to unique populations (Block Island, Narragansett Tribe, elderly, people with disabilities) demonstrates program design responsive to actual community needs rather than generic rural health templates.\nMulti-agency governance leverages existing departmental relationships rather than creating new implementation bureaucracy. In a state where key decision-makers can convene within hours, this coordination capacity provides implementation advantage.\nLimitations\nThe definitional mismatch between federal and state rural designations creates ongoing tension. Rhode Island’s state-defined rural population exceeds the federal definition by nearly a factor of 10, meaning RHTP workload allocation was calculated using a population base of 24,147 rather than 195,809. This structural disadvantage cannot be overcome through application quality.\nRhode Island’s rural population lives relatively close to urban healthcare resources. Even Block Island is 12 miles from the mainland, and the state’s most remote inland communities are within 45 minutes of Providence. While isolation is real, it differs qualitatively from the multi-hour drives that define rural healthcare access elsewhere.\nThe absence of traditional rural infrastructure (CAHs, REHs, RHCs) limits applicability of RHTP strategies designed for facilities operating under rural-specific payment frameworks.\nRequest-to-award gap of 84% forces difficult prioritization. Scaling a $1 billion vision to $156 million reality requires abandoning or deferring substantial initiative components.\nDistinctive Contributions\nRhode Island’s application offers potential lessons for other small states and states with geographically fragmented rural populations:\nIsland and coastal isolation models: Block Island’s integrated approach (PACE, Community Medicine, EMS enhancement, workforce training) may inform strategies for other ferry-dependent or geographically isolated communities.\nState-sponsored EHR aggregation: The approach of aggregating demand across small practices to negotiate volume discounts and provide shared technical management may offer templates for states with fragmented rural provider landscapes.\nHub and Network architecture: The distributed model connecting clinical hubs with community-led networks may prove applicable to other states where fixed clinic locations cannot efficiently serve dispersed populations.\nConclusion Rhode Island demonstrates that rural health transformation is not solely a big-state problem. The nation’s smallest state faces distinct rural health challenges, including geographic fragmentation, island isolation, tribal health needs, and seasonal population volatility, that require tailored solutions rather than scaled-down versions of strategies designed for vast geographies.\nThe state’s $156 million allocation enables meaningful investment in infrastructure, workforce, and care delivery models calibrated to Rhode Island’s unique conditions. Whether this investment achieves lasting transformation depends on successful AHEAD model implementation, effective prioritization across competing initiatives, and the resilience of reformed payment structures to sustain what RHTP resources establish.\nRhode Island’s experience will test whether strategic alignment, governance coherence, and population-specific focus can compensate for the scale limitations that formula mechanics impose on small states. The answer matters not just for Rhode Island’s 195,809 state-defined rural residents, but for rural health policy design that increasingly treats geographic vastness as the primary indicator of need.\nCross-References RHTP 2.A: RHTP Structure and Rules (statutory framework) RHTP 2.B: Medicaid Architecture (expansion context) RHTP 2.E: Indian Health Service and Tribal Health Systems (Narragansett Tribe context) RHTP 3.CT: Connecticut (AHEAD cohort, regional comparison) RHTP 3.MA: Massachusetts (New England regional context) RHTP 3.VT: Vermont (New England comparison) RHTP 4.F: Payment Model Innovation (AHEAD model analysis) Sources Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. “CMS Announces $50 Billion in Awards to Strengthen Rural Health in All 50 States.” CMS Newsroom, 29 Dec. 2025, www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-announces-50-billion-awards.\nGovernor Dan McKee. “Governor McKee Leads Effort to Transform Rural Health Care with Federal Funding Application.” Rhode Island Governor’s Office, 5 Nov. 2025, governor.ri.gov/press-releases/governor-mckee-leads-effort-transform-rural-health-care-federal-funding-application.\nKaiser Family Foundation. “First-Year Rural Health Fund Awards Range From Less Than $100 Per Rural Resident in Ten States to More Than $500 in Eight.” KFF, 30 Dec. 2025, www.kff.org/state-health-policy-data/first-year-rural-health-fund-awards-range-from-less-than-100-per-rural-resident-in-ten-states-to-more-than-500-in-eight/.\nRhode Island Department of Health. “Defining Rural Rhode Island.” RIDOH, 2022, health.ri.gov/rural-health-definition.\nRhode Island Department of Health. “Rural Health Transformation Program.” RIDOH, 2025, health.ri.gov/healthcare/rural-health-transformation-program.\nRhode Island Department of Health. “Rural Health Transformation Program Community Listening Session.” RIDOH, Sept. 2025, health.ri.gov/sites/g/files/xkgbur1006/files/2025-09/rural-health-transformation-program-community-listening-session.pdf.\nRhode Island Executive Office of Health and Human Services. “Rhode Island Rural Health Transformation Program Application Project Narrative.” EOHHS, 3 Nov. 2025, eohhs.ri.gov/sites/g/files/xkgbur226/files/2025-11/RI%20RHTP%20-%20Project%20Narrative%202025%2011-3.pdf.\nRhode Island Executive Office of Health and Human Services. “Rhode Island Health Care System Planning Advisory Council Presentation.” EOHHS, 21 Nov. 2025, eohhs.ri.gov/sites/g/files/xkgbur226/files/2025-11/11-21%20-%20EOHHS%20Advisory%20Council%20Deck%20-%20HCSP.pdf.\nRural Health Information Hub. “Rural Health for Rhode Island Overview.” RHIhub, 2025, www.ruralhealthinfo.org/states/rhode-island.\nUniversity of Pennsylvania Leonard Davis Institute. “Analysis of Rural Health Transformation Program Allocation Methodology.” Penn LDI, 4 Dec. 2025.\nSeries 3: State Implementation Rural Health Transformation Project Version 3: January 2026\n",

</div>

<p><em>January 2026</em></p>
<p>Rhode Island received <strong>$156,169,931</strong> in RHTP funding for FY2026, ranking 45th nationally and landing among the lowest allocations alongside Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, Maryland, and New Jersey. For the nation&rsquo;s smallest state, this positioning reflects structural formula mechanics that reward geographic vastness over concentrated rural need. Rhode Island&rsquo;s rural challenges operate at a scale that defies conventional rural health frameworks, requiring solutions calibrated to <strong>microgeographies where isolation means ferry dependency rather than empty highways</strong>.</p>
<p>The state submitted an ambitious <strong>$1 billion application</strong> across 13 interconnected initiatives. Receiving approximately 16% of that request forces prioritization among competing transformation objectives. What emerges is a strategy that treats Rhode Island&rsquo;s unique conditions, including <strong>island isolation, tribal sovereignty, coastal fragmentation, and seasonal population volatility</strong>, as design constraints requiring innovation rather than limitations preventing participation.</p>
<h2 id="state-context">State Context<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#state-context">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>The Geography of Compressed Distance</strong></p>
<p>Rhode Island spans just <strong>1,034 square miles</strong> of land area, making it the smallest state in the nation by a substantial margin. The entire state could fit inside a single Montana ranch with acreage to spare. Yet within this compressed geography lies a complexity of <strong>peninsulas, bays, bridges, and islands</strong> that fragments proximity into practical isolation.</p>
<p>The state&rsquo;s coastal and island topography defies the assumption that small states lack rural health challenges. <strong>Block Island</strong> sits 12 miles offshore in the Atlantic, accessible only by ferry or small aircraft. <strong>Prudence Island</strong> in Narragansett Bay requires boat transport. Communities along Rhode Island&rsquo;s western border with Connecticut experience limited access despite their relative closeness to urban centers. What matters is not distance measured in miles but <strong>accessibility measured in travel time, cost, and seasonal reliability</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Definitional Complexity and Its Consequences</strong></p>
<p>Rhode Island illustrates the definitional tensions that complicate rural health policy nationwide. The <strong>federal HRSA definition</strong> used in RHTP workload calculations identifies only <strong>2 towns and 24,147 residents</strong> as rural, specifically Block Island (New Shoreham) and Westerly. This narrow definition creates a statistical artifact where Rhode Island appears to have minimal rural health needs.</p>
<p>The <strong>Rhode Island State Office of Rural Health</strong> employs a broader definition accepted by HRSA for state planning purposes. This framework encompasses <strong>18 towns with 195,809 residents</strong>, representing 17.9% of the state&rsquo;s 1.1 million population. These communities share average population density of <strong>314 persons per square mile</strong>, well below the nearly 2,200 per square mile observed in non-rural areas. The 18 rural towns include:</p>
<table>
  <thead>
      <tr>
          <th>County</th>
          <th>Rural Towns</th>
      </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
      <tr>
          <td>Providence County</td>
          <td>Burrillville, North Smithfield, Foster, Glocester, Scituate, Smithfield</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Kent County</td>
          <td>East Greenwich, West Greenwich</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Washington County</td>
          <td>Charlestown, Exeter, Hopkinton, New Shoreham (Block Island), Richmond, Westerly</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Newport County</td>
          <td>Jamestown, Little Compton, Portsmouth, Tiverton</td>
      </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>Using the state definition, Rhode Island&rsquo;s RHTP allocation calculates to approximately <strong>$797 per rural resident</strong> annually. Using the federal definition produces an astronomical per-capita figure that distorts comparative analysis. This definitional gap, a factor of nearly 10 in population covered, shapes every aspect of implementation planning.</p>
<p><strong>Demographics: Older, Vulnerable, and Seasonal</strong></p>
<p>Rhode Island&rsquo;s rural population skews <strong>older and more economically vulnerable</strong> than non-rural counterparts. Adults aged 65 and older comprise <strong>23% of the rural population</strong> compared to 17% in non-rural areas. This demographic pattern mirrors national trends but intensifies in communities where younger residents have migrated to urban employment centers.</p>
<p>Nearly <strong>13% of rural Rhode Island residents</strong> have incomes below 200% of the federal poverty level, and 5.4% have less than a high school diploma. Employment patterns diverge from urban areas: rural residents work disproportionately in <strong>construction and agriculture/fishing</strong>, industries that often lack employer-sponsored health insurance.</p>
<p>The <strong>seasonal dimension</strong> compounds demographic challenges. Many rural communities are popular tourist destinations where population temporarily doubles or triples during peak summer months. Local healthcare infrastructure must surge to meet tourist demand, then contract as visitors depart. <strong>Seasonal housing accounts for nearly 10%</strong> of rural units statewide, reaching nearly a quarter of homes in Block Island and Westerly. This housing pressure raises living costs, forcing healthcare workers to commute long distances or relocate entirely.</p>
<p><strong>Health Disparities That Persist Despite Proximity</strong></p>
<p>Rhode Island&rsquo;s rural residents experience measurably worse health outcomes than their non-rural neighbors. Adults in rural areas have a <strong>15% higher rate of hypertension</strong> (36% vs. 31%), a <strong>28% higher rate of cardiovascular disease</strong> (16% vs. 13%), and a <strong>15% higher rate of tobacco use</strong>. The <strong>rural suicide rate is 32% higher</strong> than in non-rural areas (13.0 deaths per 100,000 compared to 9.8).</p>
<p>Provider availability represents the most significant barrier. The availability of primary care physicians in rural areas is <strong>37% lower</strong> than in non-rural areas (0.59 per 1,000 population compared to 0.94). Rural areas have only 0.34 FTE per 1,000 Medicaid enrollees compared to 0.48 in non-rural areas. Parts of Providence and Washington Counties are designated <strong>Primary Care Health Professional Shortage Areas</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Access to psychiatric care is especially limited.</strong> All of Newport and Washington Counties, plus part of Providence County, are designated mental health professional shortage areas. Rural areas have only <strong>0.02 FTE psychiatrists per 1,000 residents</strong> compared to 0.34 in non-rural areas, a 95% difference. Based on recent claims data, <strong>no psychiatrists accepting Medicaid practice in any of the 18 rural towns</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="healthcare-infrastructure-fragile-but-functioning">Healthcare Infrastructure: Fragile but Functioning<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#healthcare-infrastructure-fragile-but-functioning">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>The Sole Rural Hospital</strong></p>
<p>Rhode Island has <strong>only one acute care hospital in a rural area</strong>: Westerly Hospital. This facility operates with a <strong>negative operating margin, the lowest in the state</strong>. Westerly Hospital joined Yale New Haven Health in 2016, providing system affiliation but not resolving fundamental financial pressures inherent to rural hospital operation.</p>
<p>The state has <strong>zero Critical Access Hospitals, zero Rural Emergency Hospitals, and one Rural Health Clinic</strong> (Block Island Health Services). This infrastructure absence reflects Rhode Island&rsquo;s geographic compression rather than healthcare strength. Federal rural designation criteria designed for Montana and Alaska do not map onto Rhode Island&rsquo;s conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Block Island&rsquo;s Extreme Isolation</strong></p>
<p>Block Island (Town of New Shoreham) represents Rhode Island&rsquo;s <strong>most geographically isolated community</strong>. Approximately 1,100 year-round residents live 12 miles offshore, dependent on ferry service that weather can disrupt for days. During peak summer months, daily population surges to over <strong>30,000 people</strong>, a more than 25-fold increase driven by tourists, seasonal homeowners, and day-trippers.</p>
<p>The <strong>Block Island Health Services</strong> facility operates as the island&rsquo;s only medical resource, including the state&rsquo;s sole Rural Health Clinic. There are <strong>no rural birthing facilities</strong> anywhere in Rhode Island; Block Island residents requiring labor and delivery must travel to the mainland.</p>
<p><strong>The Narragansett Indian Tribe</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>Narragansett Indian Tribe</strong>, Rhode Island&rsquo;s only federally recognized tribe, operates the <strong>Narragansett Indian Health Center (NIHC)</strong> in the Charlestown area. This facility delivers primary, behavioral, and community health services to tribal members, operating under distinct federal frameworks that require government-to-government coordination rather than state direction.</p>
<p>Tribal members face persistent health disparities exceeding those of non-tribal rural residents. Access to dental, specialty, and diagnostic care remains limited due to transportation barriers, outdated infrastructure, and incomplete integration of tribal health data within statewide systems. <strong>Specialty care coverage for tribal members is currently very limited</strong>, underscoring the need for expanded local capacity through RHTP investment.</p>
<p><strong>Medicaid Context</strong></p>
<p>Rhode Island <strong>expanded Medicaid</strong> under the Affordable Care Act and maintains the HUSKY Health program covering approximately 1.1 million residents. Expansion provides coverage for populations that in non-expansion states would remain uninsured, strengthening rural provider financial stability through expanded patient coverage.</p>
<p>However, <strong>Medicaid reimbursement rates remain challenging</strong> for rural providers. The higher concentration of Medicaid and Medicare patients in rural areas contributes to financial pressures that have constrained service expansion. The impending <strong>H.R. 1 Medicaid cuts</strong> create legitimate concern for providers operating on already thin margins.</p>
<h2 id="rhtp-application-and-award">RHTP Application and Award<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#rhtp-application-and-award">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Lead Agency and Governance</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>Rhode Island Executive Office of Health and Human Services (EOHHS)</strong> serves as lead agency under Secretary Richard Charest, with Assistant Secretary Ana Novais and Interim RHTP Director Manuel Ortiz coordinating implementation. EOHHS functions as the single State Medicaid agency and implementation lead for the CMS AHEAD model, positioning it to integrate RHTP resources with existing transformation initiatives.</p>
<p>The governance structure involves multiple tiers:</p>
<table>
  <thead>
      <tr>
          <th>Structure</th>
          <th>Composition</th>
          <th>Function</th>

  <tbody>
      <tr>
          <td>Executive Committee</td>

          <td>Strategic oversight and policy direction</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Interagency Leadership Team</td>
          <td>Cabinet members and senior staff from BHDDH, DCYF, DHS, EOHHS, OHA, OVS, OHIC, DLT, RIDE, RIDOH, OMB, OPC, DOA</td>

          <td>EOHHS Project Director, Finance Director, Project Managers</td>

      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Rural Stakeholder Advisory Committee</td>
          <td>Patients, residents, rural organizations, providers, tribal leadership</td>
          <td>Community engagement and implementation input</td>
      </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>This <strong>multi-tiered architecture</strong> reflects Rhode Island&rsquo;s compact governance advantage: the entire state health system fits within coordinating distance, enabling integration impossible in larger states.</p>
<p><strong>Technical Score and Award Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Rhode Island received approximately <strong>$56 million above the $100 million equal distribution baseline</strong>, suggesting modest technical score performance. The state&rsquo;s limited geographic rurality under federal definitions constrained discretionary allocation competitiveness regardless of application quality.</p>
<p>The state requested <strong>$1 billion over five years</strong> across 13 initiatives. Receiving $156 million for FY2026 (approximately 16% of annualized request) forces difficult prioritization. The request-to-award gap is among the largest percentage shortfalls nationally, reflecting formula mechanics that penalize states with small land areas regardless of rural population concentration or health severity.</p>

<p><strong>Initiative Highlights</strong></p>
<p><strong>Community Clinical Care Hubs and Networks</strong> (Initiative 1) form the operational backbone. Hubs provide integrated primary care, specialty care, behavioral health, oral health, and pharmacy services through multidisciplinary care teams. Networks mobilize local partners including schools, libraries, and community organizations to develop coordinated improvement strategies. This distributed model reflects Rhode Island&rsquo;s fragmented geography where fixed clinic locations cannot serve dispersed populations efficiently.</p>
<p><strong>Hospital-at-Home</strong> (Initiative 5) leverages Rhode Island&rsquo;s compact geography as an asset. Unlike states where home-based acute care faces logistical impossibility due to distance, Rhode Island can realistically deploy clinical teams to patient homes for conditions like COPD exacerbations, pneumonia, cellulitis, and post-operative monitoring. The initiative coordinates with enhanced EMS capabilities and Hub care coordination systems.</p>
<p><strong>Block Island Capacity Building</strong> (Initiative 8) addresses the state&rsquo;s most isolated community through integrated strategies: establishing the island&rsquo;s first <strong>PACE (Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly)</strong> program in partnership with PACE Rhode Island, expanding the Community Medicine Program for home-based preventive and follow-up care, deploying a full-time Community Health Worker, and modernizing EMS infrastructure including marine transport capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Value-Based Payment Transition</strong> (Initiative 11) represents Rhode Island&rsquo;s largest single initiative by request ($180 million) and aligns with the state&rsquo;s participation in CMS&rsquo;s <strong>AHEAD (Achieving Healthcare Efficiency through Accountable Design)</strong> model. The initiative supports hospitals and primary care practices in transitioning to State-approved advanced alternative payment models through incentive payments, technical assistance, and transformation grants.</p>
<h2 id="stakeholder-engagement">Stakeholder Engagement<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#stakeholder-engagement">#</a></h2>
<p>Rhode Island conducted <strong>extensive community engagement</strong> throughout application development:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two statewide virtual Community Listening Sessions</li>
<li>Three hybrid Listening Sessions: Block Island, southern Rhode Island (Washington County), northern Rhode Island (Burrillville)</li>
<li>More than 20 public meetings and community forums</li>
<li>Online Community Feedback Request generating over 300 survey responses</li>
<li>Outreach reaching approximately 1,200 individuals</li>
</ul>
<p>Community listening sessions identified common barriers:</p>
<p><strong>Workforce</strong> emerged as central concern. Primary and behavioral health clinicians concentrate in urban centers, forcing rural residents to travel long distances. Provider shortages result in long wait times. Access to home and community-based services is restricted by waiting lists, reimbursement limitations, and geographic isolation.</p>
<p><strong>Transportation</strong> compounds access barriers. Residents living on islands or across bridges indicated that routine appointments create significant logistical burdens.</p>
<p><strong>Technology</strong> challenges pressure rural practices. Providers struggle to adopt interoperable EHR systems due to high upfront costs, limited IT support, and inconsistent broadband connectivity. These barriers contribute to independent practice consolidation into larger health systems less responsive to local community needs.</p>

<p>These commitments respond to RHTP technical score factors while aligning with state workforce development priorities.</p>
<h2 id="sustainability-considerations">Sustainability Considerations<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#sustainability-considerations">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>The 2030 Question</strong></p>
<p>Rhode Island&rsquo;s sustainability strategy centers on <strong>embedding RHTP initiatives within existing systems</strong> and transitioning to ongoing funding mechanisms:</p>
<p><strong>Financial Sustainability</strong>: Many investments represent one-time infrastructure costs (mobile clinics, EHR systems, facility upgrades) that create capacity sustained through subsequent service reimbursement. Hospital-at-Home, MIH-CP services, and Crisis Stabilization Centers will transition to Medicaid, Medicare, and commercial payer coverage after initial implementation.</p>
<p><strong>AHEAD Alignment</strong>: Value-based payment transformation (Initiative 11) provides the economic logic: if hospitals and primary care practices successfully transition to global budgets and advanced APMs by 2030, reformed payment models sustain transformed practices without ongoing RHTP-style grants.</p>
<p><strong>Operational Integration</strong>: Programs are designed to build on existing entities (FQHCs, hospitals, EMS agencies, community organizations) ensuring that RHTP functions become integrated into standard operating procedures.</p>
<p><strong>What Survives Partial Funding</strong></p>
<p>Given Rhode Island received approximately 16% of its request, prioritization will determine which initiatives proceed at full scope:</p>
<p><strong>Likely Preserved</strong>: Infrastructure investments (EHR, mobile clinics, accessibility upgrades), Block Island capacity building, Narragansett Tribe modernization, EMS Academy establishment</p>
<p><strong>Uncertain</strong>: Full Hub and Network deployment across all 18 towns, comprehensive workforce incentive programs, complete Hospital-at-Home scaling</p>
<p><strong>At Risk</strong>: Recovery Community Center expansion, some behavioral health facility construction, full HIT infrastructure grant scope</p>
<h2 id="analysis-and-assessment">Analysis and Assessment<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#analysis-and-assessment">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
<p>Rhode Island&rsquo;s approach demonstrates <strong>strategic coherence</strong> in treating geographic compression as an implementation advantage rather than policy disqualifier. The state&rsquo;s compact scale enables coordination, governance integration, and service delivery models (Hospital-at-Home, mobile integrated health) that would face logistical impossibility in larger states.</p>
<p>The <strong>AHEAD model alignment</strong> provides sustainability logic missing from many state applications. Rhode Island articulates clear sequencing: use RHTP resources to prepare providers for value-based care, then sustain transformation through reformed payment structures.</p>
<p><strong>Attention to unique populations</strong> (Block Island, Narragansett Tribe, elderly, people with disabilities) demonstrates program design responsive to actual community needs rather than generic rural health templates.</p>
<p><strong>Multi-agency governance</strong> leverages existing departmental relationships rather than creating new implementation bureaucracy. In a state where key decision-makers can convene within hours, this coordination capacity provides implementation advantage.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>definitional mismatch</strong> between federal and state rural designations creates ongoing tension. Rhode Island&rsquo;s state-defined rural population exceeds the federal definition by nearly a factor of 10, meaning RHTP workload allocation was calculated using a population base of 24,147 rather than 195,809. This structural disadvantage cannot be overcome through application quality.</p>
<p>Rhode Island&rsquo;s rural population lives <strong>relatively close to urban healthcare resources</strong>. Even Block Island is 12 miles from the mainland, and the state&rsquo;s most remote inland communities are within 45 minutes of Providence. While isolation is real, it differs qualitatively from the multi-hour drives that define rural healthcare access elsewhere.</p>
<p>The <strong>absence of traditional rural infrastructure</strong> (CAHs, REHs, RHCs) limits applicability of RHTP strategies designed for facilities operating under rural-specific payment frameworks.</p>
<p><strong>Request-to-award gap of 84%</strong> forces difficult prioritization. Scaling a $1 billion vision to $156 million reality requires abandoning or deferring substantial initiative components.</p>
<p><strong>Distinctive Contributions</strong></p>
<p>Rhode Island&rsquo;s application offers potential lessons for other small states and states with geographically fragmented rural populations:</p>
<p><strong>Island and coastal isolation models</strong>: Block Island&rsquo;s integrated approach (PACE, Community Medicine, EMS enhancement, workforce training) may inform strategies for other ferry-dependent or geographically isolated communities.</p>
<p><strong>State-sponsored EHR aggregation</strong>: The approach of aggregating demand across small practices to negotiate volume discounts and provide shared technical management may offer templates for states with fragmented rural provider landscapes.</p>
<p><strong>Hub and Network architecture</strong>: The distributed model connecting clinical hubs with community-led networks may prove applicable to other states where fixed clinic locations cannot efficiently serve dispersed populations.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>Rhode Island demonstrates that <strong>rural health transformation is not solely a big-state problem</strong>. The nation&rsquo;s smallest state faces distinct rural health challenges, including geographic fragmentation, island isolation, tribal health needs, and seasonal population volatility, that require tailored solutions rather than scaled-down versions of strategies designed for vast geographies.</p>
<p>The state&rsquo;s <strong>$156 million allocation</strong> enables meaningful investment in infrastructure, workforce, and care delivery models calibrated to Rhode Island&rsquo;s unique conditions. Whether this investment achieves lasting transformation depends on successful AHEAD model implementation, effective prioritization across competing initiatives, and the resilience of reformed payment structures to sustain what RHTP resources establish.</p>
<p>Rhode Island&rsquo;s experience will test whether <strong>strategic alignment, governance coherence, and population-specific focus</strong> can compensate for the scale limitations that formula mechanics impose on small states. The answer matters not just for Rhode Island&rsquo;s 195,809 state-defined rural residents, but for rural health policy design that increasingly treats geographic vastness as the primary indicator of need.</p>
