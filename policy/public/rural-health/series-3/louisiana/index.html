  "articleBody": "First Deep South expansion state meets transformation funding: leveraged investment or eroding foundation?\nIntroduction Louisiana received $208,374,448 in Rural Health Transformation Program funding for fiscal year 2026, placing it among the top three awards in the Southeast and above the national average. The state’s approximately 1.1 million rural residents translate this award to roughly $189 per rural person over five years, a favorable position compared to larger rural states penalized by the formula’s geographic weighting.\nLouisiana occupies a unique position among Southern states. Governor John Bel Edwards made Medicaid expansion his first official act in 2016, establishing Louisiana as the first Deep South state to accept federal expansion funding. More than 600,000 residents gained coverage. The uninsured rate among adults dropped from 22.7% to 11.1% within three years. Rural hospitals that would have closed in non-expansion states survived on expansion revenue.\nThat foundation now faces erosion. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act that authorized RHTP also implements Medicaid cuts projected to remove up to 132,000 Louisianans from coverage through new work requirements. The Louisiana Hospital Association described the cuts as historic in their devastation. RHTP investment arrives alongside systematic coverage contraction, creating a tension Louisiana must navigate with less margin than non-expansion states that never built expansion-dependent infrastructure.\nRural Health Landscape Geographic Distribution\nLouisiana’s rural crisis concentrates in two distinct regions with different historical trajectories.\nThe Delta Parishes in northeastern Louisiana extend the Mississippi Delta’s poverty corridor from Arkansas and Mississippi. East Carroll Parish exemplifies the pattern: 46.5% of residents live below poverty level, median income sits at $28,321, and for Black households the figure drops to $16,690. The parish seat of Lake Providence contains a few gas stations, a handful of restaurants, and little to no industry. State health data suggests 64% of East Carroll Parish residents receive Medicaid coverage, far exceeding census estimates.\nMadison Parish, Tensas Parish, Concordia Parish, and West Carroll Parish form a corridor where hospital access depends entirely on Medicaid revenue. The Family Medical Clinic in Lake Providence reports that 50% of patients carry Medicaid insurance. Without that coverage, the clinic and others like it cannot sustain operations.\nAcadiana and Southwest Louisiana face different dynamics. Rural parishes like Vermilion, St. Landry, Evangeline, and Allen contain populations descended from Acadian exile, with distinct cultural patterns and healthcare seeking behaviors. Six rural hospitals in Acadiana face possible closure under proposed Medicaid cuts, including facilities in New Iberia, Mamou, and surrounding parishes.\nHealthcare Infrastructure\nFacility Type Count Notes Critical Access Hospitals 23 Including West Feliciana, Hood Memorial, Savoy Medical Center Rural Health Clinics 142 Distributed across rural parishes Federally Qualified Health Centers 38 systems 180+ service sites statewide Rural Hospitals (non-CAH) 31 Many reliant on Medicaid expansion revenue At-Risk Rural Hospitals 27 48% of rural hospitals vulnerable to closure The Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform and Chartis analyses identify 48% of Louisiana’s rural hospitals as vulnerable to closure. The Sheps Center for Health Services Research identifies 33 rural hospitals at particular risk of closure, conversion, or service reduction. Senate documents obtained by local media identify specific at-risk facilities including Iberia Medical Center in New Iberia, Savoy Medical Center in Mamou, Hood Memorial Hospital in Amite, Lallie Kemp Regional Medical Center in Independence, and facilities in Ruston, Bogalusa, and Bastrop.\nWorkforce Shortages\nSpecialty Designation Status Rural Impact Primary Care 86% of state designated HPSA Specialist concentration in urban areas Dental Health 86% of residents in dental HPSA Severe access gaps in Delta parishes Mental Health Majority of parishes underserved Limited behavioral health integration Specialty Care Urban concentration Rural residents travel 60+ miles for specialists Research from the Louisiana Department of Health confirms that provider growth has concentrated in urban parishes despite Medicaid expansion. Access to specialists remains more common in urban areas, contributing to persistent disparities between urban and rural populations.\nHealth Outcomes\nLouisiana’s rural parishes demonstrate outcomes consistent with Delta region patterns. Chartis data ranks Louisiana at the 90th percentile for adult obesity among rural communities nationally and the 92nd percentile for diabetes prevalence. Premature death rates hover near the 90th percentile alongside Alabama, Arkansas, and Mississippi.\nMetric Pre-Expansion (2015) Post-Expansion (2021) Current Challenge Adult Uninsured Rate 22.7% 11.1% Projected to rise under work requirements East Carroll Uninsured 35% 12.7% Coverage loss threatens reversal Preventive Care Access Limited 72% annual doctor visits Sustainability uncertain Chronic Disease Burden High Still elevated Hypertension, diabetes, obesity above state average RHTP Award and Context Funding Position\nMetric Value FY2026 Allocation $208,374,448 Baseline Component (50%) $100,000,000 Workload Component (50%) $108,374,448 Five-Year Projected Total ~$1.04 billion Rural Population ~1.1 million Per Rural Resident (5-year) ~$189 National Ranking 13th Louisiana ranks 13th nationally in total RHTP award and receives above-average per-capita funding due to its relatively concentrated rural population. The $189 per rural resident exceeds Texas ($60), Georgia ($76), and most large Southern states.\nMedicaid Context\nFactor Status Expansion Status Expanded 2016 (first Deep South state) Current Enrollment ~46.5% of state population on Medicaid Rural Parish Coverage 37% Medicaid, 22% Medicare Eligibility Threshold 138% FPL (~$22,000/individual) Projected Coverage Loss Up to 132,000 under work requirements The state’s Medicaid infrastructure represents nearly a decade of investment that RHTP can leverage. Work requirements begin in 2027, requiring people aged 19 to 64 to prove they work 80 hours per month for coverage eligibility. Enrollees must verify eligibility every six months starting December 31, 2026. In October 2028, Medicaid expansion enrollees will face a $35 copay requirement.\nFiscal Interaction\nFunding Stream Annual Amount Net Position RHTP Investment ~$208M Positive Medicaid Cuts (projected) ~$400M+ annually by 2029 Negative Net Healthcare Funding Net negative Louisiana’s projected Medicaid losses exceed RHTP investment by a factor of two or more over the five-year period. The math produces net negative investment when all federal healthcare funding is considered together.\nState Approach Governance Structure\nLouisiana Department of Health (LDH) serves as lead agency. LDH Secretary Stephen R. Russo and Medicaid Director Julie Foster Hagan oversee implementation. The department issued a Request for Information (RFI) in September 2025 soliciting stakeholder input on implementation strategies.\nLDH’s vision emphasizes transformative changes with long-lasting health impacts for rural Louisianans. The September 2025 RFI sought recommendations from hospitals, healthcare providers, academic institutions, community-based organizations, technology suppliers, and rural residents.\nStrategic Framework\nLouisiana organized its approach around seven primary initiatives:\nTelehealth Infrastructure: Technology deployment for remote specialty access Community Paramedicine: EMS-based chronic disease management and prevention Workforce Pipeline: Training and retention programs for rural providers PACE Site Expansion: Retrofitting rural hospital spaces for comprehensive elderly care Care Navigation and CHW Deployment: Community health worker services and SDOH screening Data Analytics: Enhanced monitoring and program adjustment capabilities Value-Based Payment Pilots: Alternative payment models with managed care organizations The state explicitly seeks to strengthen local healthcare systems, embed technology in rural communities, and expand workforce capacity while improving access to care and healthcare delivery.\nProgram and Funding Distribution Program Estimated Allocation Implementing Organization Focus Telehealth Hub Development $35-40M LSU Health Sciences Center, Regional Hospitals Specialty access, remote monitoring Community Paramedicine $25-30M Parish EMS Systems, Regional Medical Centers Chronic disease management, prevention Workforce Pipeline $30-35M LSU, LSUHSC, Louisiana Primary Care Association Training, recruitment, retention PACE Site Expansion $20-25M Rural Hospitals, Aging Service Providers Facility retrofit, comprehensive elderly care Care Navigation/CHW $15-20M FQHCs, Community Organizations, LACHON SDOH screening, referral completion Data Infrastructure $15-20M LDH, Health Information Exchange Analytics, monitoring dashboards Value-Based Care Pilots $20-25M Managed Care Organizations, Provider Networks Alternative payment models Administrative $6-8M Louisiana Department of Health Program coordination, oversight Social Care Integration SDOH/HRSN Initiatives\nLouisiana’s RHTP application incorporates SDOH screening and health-related social needs navigation as components of the care navigation initiative. The state’s RFI explicitly sought input on strategies addressing social problems that lead to poor health, including food insecurity, housing, transportation, utilities assistance, furthering education, and mental health connections.\nCommunity Health Worker Programs\nLouisiana maintains established CHW infrastructure that positions the state for RHTP-funded expansion:\nHB 587 (2023) established the Louisiana Community Health Worker Workforce Board within LDH Louisiana CHW Institute at LSU Health Sciences Center provides training and workforce development LACHON (Louisiana Community Health Outreach Network) coordinates CHW training and community health outreach Medicaid reimbursement for CHW services exists under state plan as professional services billed incident to supervising providers FQHCs, RHCs, and American Indian clinics use HCPCS codes T1015, H2020, or D0999 for CHW services MCOs may reimburse CHW services through their own contracts in addition to state plan requirements The Louisiana CHW Workforce Coalition is co-led by LACHON and the Louisiana CHW Institute, with membership including LDH Office of Public Health, managed care organizations, community-based organizations, Louisiana Primary Care Association, and health systems.\nCIE Platform Status\nLouisiana does not have a statewide closed-loop referral platform currently deployed. The state’s 211 system provides resource directory services but lacks the bidirectional referral tracking that characterizes community information exchange platforms. RHTP implementation may include procurement for referral platform infrastructure as part of care navigation enhancement.\nSocial Care Integration Summary\nComponent Included in Plan Estimated Funding Vendor/Operator Likely Funded? SDOH Screening Yes Embedded in care navigation FQHCs, RHCs, Hospital Systems Yes HRSN Navigation Yes $8-12M CHWs, Care Coordinators At Risk CHW Deployment Yes $10-15M LACHON, Louisiana CHW Institute, FQHCs Yes CIE Platform Under consideration $3-5M TBD (procurement needed) At Risk Key Subawardees Intermediary Organizations\nThe Louisiana Hospital Association (LHA) signed a statement calling Medicaid cuts historic in their devastation, positioning it as advocate for rural hospital sustainability while coordinating RHTP technical assistance. LHA’s existing relationships with rural hospitals provide distribution channels for infrastructure investment.\nThe Louisiana Primary Care Association coordinates FQHC participation across the state’s 38 health center systems operating 180+ service sites. FQHCs serve as primary care backbone in rural parishes and will implement CHW deployment and care navigation programs.\nThe Louisiana Rural Health Association under Executive Director Jeff Reynolds provides policy coordination and has publicly warned that hospital closures represent the death knell for rural communities.\nAcademic Partners\nLSU Health Sciences Center provides workforce training infrastructure including residency programs and telehealth hub capacity. The Delta Region Community Health Systems Development Program has already partnered with Louisiana facilities including Savoy Medical Center and Natchitoches Regional Medical Center.\nLouisiana CHW Institute at LSU Center for Healthcare Value and Effectiveness leads workforce development for community health workers and partners with LDH on Medicaid financing strategies.\nKey Subawardee Registry\nOrganization Type Estimated Contract RHTP Role Louisiana Hospital Association Intermediary $8-12M Technical assistance, network coordination Louisiana Primary Care Association Intermediary $6-10M FQHC coordination, workforce pipeline LSU Health Sciences Center Academic Partner $15-20M Telehealth hub, residency expansion, workforce training Louisiana CHW Institute Academic Partner $3-5M CHW training, workforce development LACHON Community Partner $2-4M CHW network coordination, community outreach Regional Hospital Systems Provider Hubs $40-50M (aggregate) Infrastructure investment, service expansion Parish EMS Systems Provider $15-20M (aggregate) Community paramedicine deployment Assessment Strengths\nMedicaid Expansion Foundation. Louisiana enters RHTP implementation with advantages unavailable to non-expansion states. The 2016 expansion created infrastructure, relationships, and revenue streams that RHTP can enhance. More than 600,000 residents gained coverage. Hospitals that would have closed survived. FQHCs expanded capacity. Provider networks grew.\nEstablished MCO Infrastructure. The state’s managed care infrastructure provides established distribution channels for RHTP funding. Rather than building new contracting relationships, LDH can modify existing MCO contracts to incorporate RHTP requirements.\nCHW Workforce Infrastructure. Louisiana’s existing CHW reimbursement and training infrastructure positions the state ahead of peers lacking established pathways. The 2023 legislation creating the CHW Workforce Board provides governance structure for expansion.\nData and Analytics Capacity. LDH’s Healthy Louisiana Dashboard demonstrated sophisticated use of data for program monitoring and adjustment. The dashboard tracked Medicaid utilization by parish in real time, allowing targeted intervention. This capacity transfers to RHTP implementation.\nVulnerabilities\nCoverage Erosion Under Medicaid Cuts. Louisiana’s primary vulnerability is coverage loss. Work requirements projected to remove up to 132,000 Louisianans from Medicaid begin in 2027. Rural parishes with the highest Medicaid enrollment face the greatest exposure. East Carroll Parish illustrates the risk: 64% of residents carry Medicaid coverage. Work requirements targeting this population would devastate providers dependent on Medicaid revenue. RHTP cannot backfill coverage losses.\nNet Negative Fiscal Position. Louisiana will invest approximately $1 billion through RHTP while losing $2 billion or more through Medicaid reductions over the five-year period. The arithmetic produces net loss.\nAt-Risk Hospital Concentration. With 27 hospitals (48%) at risk of closure and 9 at immediate risk, Louisiana faces among the highest rural hospital vulnerability rates nationally. RHTP infrastructure investment cannot compensate for facilities that close before transformation takes effect.\nUrban Provider Concentration. Provider growth concentrated in urban parishes despite expansion. Rural parishes gained coverage but did not gain proportional provider growth. RHTP workforce initiatives must overcome structural barriers that expansion alone could not address.\nSustainability Prospects\nElement Sustainability Prospect Key Dependency PACE Sites High Facility retrofits create durable assets Telehealth Infrastructure Moderate-High Utilization by covered populations Community Paramedicine Moderate Ongoing operational funding Workforce Pipeline Moderate Provider retention post-training CHW Programs Moderate Medicaid reimbursement continuation Care Navigation Low-Moderate Continued funding for positions Data Infrastructure High Technology investments persist Value-Based Payment Pilots Variable MCO adoption, provider participation Louisiana’s PACE site expansion represents potentially durable transformation. Retrofitting rural hospital spaces for Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly creates physical infrastructure that persists beyond RHTP. PACE programs serve Medicare and Medicaid dual-eligible populations with comprehensive wraparound services, generating sustainable revenue.\nCHW program sustainability depends on continued Medicaid reimbursement. Louisiana’s state plan authority for CHW services provides foundation, but reimbursement rates and covered services could face pressure under Medicaid restructuring.\nCritical Success Factors\nCoverage preservation: Minimizing Medicaid losses under work requirements determines whether expansion infrastructure survives MCO engagement: Managed care organizations must actively support RHTP initiatives through network and payment modifications Provider retention: Workforce investments must produce providers who remain in rural practice beyond training periods Hospital stabilization: At-risk facilities must survive long enough for transformation initiatives to take effect CHW integration: Community health worker services must demonstrate value to sustain Medicaid reimbursement Conclusion Louisiana’s RHTP implementation represents leveraged investment on existing infrastructure. The state’s 2016 Medicaid expansion created a foundation unavailable to non-expansion states. RHTP can enhance that foundation, expanding workforce capacity, building technology infrastructure, and improving care delivery for covered populations.\nThe fundamental threat lies outside RHTP’s scope. Medicaid cuts projected to remove 132,000 or more Louisianans from coverage will erode the revenue base supporting rural hospitals and clinics. East Carroll Parish demonstrates what happens when coverage reaches 64% of residents: the entire health system depends on Medicaid revenue. Remove that coverage and the system collapses regardless of RHTP investment.\nLouisiana’s $208 million FY2026 award provides meaningful resources for transformation. The state’s established CHW workforce and Medicaid infrastructure offer implementation advantages. LDH’s track record with data-driven program management suggests capacity for effective oversight.\nThe state cannot, however, transform a system while that system’s financial foundation erodes. Louisiana built rural health infrastructure on Medicaid expansion. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act takes that foundation away with one hand while offering RHTP investment with the other. The arithmetic produces net loss when all federal healthcare funding is considered together.\nWhat to Watch\nMonitor coverage losses under work requirements as they phase in beginning 2027. The 132,000 estimate may prove conservative. East Carroll Parish and similar Delta parishes will demonstrate impact earliest as populations with highest Medicaid dependence face administrative barriers.\nTrack rural hospital financial indicators as expansion revenue declines. Facilities identified at risk, including Iberia Medical Center, Savoy Medical Center, Hood Memorial Hospital, and hospitals in Ruston, Bogalusa, and Bastrop, will signal whether RHTP infrastructure investment can compensate for coverage losses.\nObserve PACE site development as potential model for sustainable transformation. If Louisiana successfully retrofits rural hospital spaces for comprehensive elderly care, the model may prove replicable across states seeking post-acute care alternatives.\nEvaluate CHW program expansion under RHTP. Louisiana’s existing infrastructure provides baseline; RHTP-funded growth will test whether the state can scale community health worker deployment to address SDOH systematically.\nCross-References\nRHTP 2A: RHTP Structure and Rules RHTP 2B: Medicaid Architecture and the $911B Question RHTP 2H: The 2030 Cliff RHTP 3.MS: Mississippi (regional comparison, Delta corridor) RHTP 3.TX: Texas (scale penalty comparison) RHTP 3.AR: Arkansas (Delta region comparison) Series 10A: Mississippi Delta Regional Deep Dive Sources Becker’s Hospital Review. “756 Hospitals at Risk of Closure, State by State.” Becker’s Hospital Review, Dec. 2025, www.beckershospitalreview.com/finance/756-hospitals-at-risk-of-closure-state-by-state/.\nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services. “CMS Announces $50 Billion in Awards to Strengthen Rural Health in All 50 States.” CMS Newsroom, 29 Dec. 2025, www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-announces-50-billion-awards-strengthen-rural-health-all-50-states.\nChartis. “Rural Hospital Closures and Care-Access Crisis: 2025 State of the State.” Chartis, Feb. 2025, www.chartis.com/insights/2025-rural-health-state-state.\nKADN News 15. “6 Rural Hospitals in Acadiana Face Possible Closure as Funding Cuts Loom.” KADN News 15 Investigates, 2 July 2025, www.kadn.com/news/investigates/6-rural-hospitals-in-acadiana-face-possible-closure-as-funding-cuts-loom/.\nLouisiana Department of Health. “LDH Announces Rural Health Transformation Funding.” LDH News, 29 Dec. 2025, ldh.la.gov/news/RHTP-funding-announcement.\nLouisiana Department of Health. “Rural Health Transformation Program.” LDH, 2025, ldh.la.gov/page/rural-health-transformation-program.\nMarkey, Edward J., et al. “Markey, Leader Schumer, Wyden, Merkley Release Data Detailing Hundreds of Rural Hospitals Across U.S. at Risk Due to Republican Health Care Cuts.” U.S. Senate, 12 June 2025, www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/markey-leader-schumer-wyden-merkley-release-data-detailing-hundreds-of-rural-hospitals-across-us-at-risk-due-to-republican-health-care-cuts.\nNational Academy for State Health Policy. “State Community Health Worker Policies: Louisiana.” NASHP, 10 Apr. 2025, nashp.org/state-tracker/state-community-health-worker-policies/louisiana/.\nNOLA.com. “Medicaid Cuts Could Shut Rural Hospitals in Louisiana.” The Times-Picayune, 28 June 2025, www.nola.com/news/healthcare_hospitals/louisiana-rural-hospitals-medicaid-cuts/.\nThe Advocate. “Change Is Coming to Louisiana Rural Health Care.” The Advocate, 8 July 2025, www.theadvocate.com/acadiana/news/change-is-coming-to-louisiana-rural-health-care/.\nRHTP 3.LA: Louisiana Series 3: State Implementation Rural Health Transformation Project Version 3: January 2026\n",

<p><em>First Deep South expansion state meets transformation funding: leveraged investment or eroding foundation?</em></p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#introduction">#</a></h2>
<p>Louisiana received <strong>$208,374,448</strong> in Rural Health Transformation Program funding for fiscal year 2026, placing it among the top three awards in the Southeast and above the national average. The state&rsquo;s approximately <strong>1.1 million rural residents</strong> translate this award to roughly <strong>$189 per rural person</strong> over five years, a favorable position compared to larger rural states penalized by the formula&rsquo;s geographic weighting.</p>
<p>Louisiana occupies a unique position among Southern states. Governor John Bel Edwards made Medicaid expansion his first official act in 2016, establishing Louisiana as <strong>the first Deep South state to accept federal expansion funding</strong>. More than 600,000 residents gained coverage. The uninsured rate among adults dropped from 22.7% to 11.1% within three years. Rural hospitals that would have closed in non-expansion states survived on expansion revenue.</p>
<p>That foundation now faces erosion. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act that authorized RHTP also implements Medicaid cuts projected to remove <strong>up to 132,000 Louisianans from coverage</strong> through new work requirements. The Louisiana Hospital Association described the cuts as historic in their devastation. RHTP investment arrives alongside systematic coverage contraction, creating a tension Louisiana must navigate with less margin than non-expansion states that never built expansion-dependent infrastructure.</p>

<p><strong>Geographic Distribution</strong></p>
<p>Louisiana&rsquo;s rural crisis concentrates in two distinct regions with different historical trajectories.</p>
<p>The <strong>Delta Parishes</strong> in northeastern Louisiana extend the Mississippi Delta&rsquo;s poverty corridor from Arkansas and Mississippi. East Carroll Parish exemplifies the pattern: <strong>46.5% of residents live below poverty level</strong>, median income sits at $28,321, and for Black households the figure drops to $16,690. The parish seat of Lake Providence contains a few gas stations, a handful of restaurants, and little to no industry. State health data suggests <strong>64% of East Carroll Parish residents receive Medicaid coverage</strong>, far exceeding census estimates.</p>
<p>Madison Parish, Tensas Parish, Concordia Parish, and West Carroll Parish form a corridor where hospital access depends entirely on Medicaid revenue. The Family Medical Clinic in Lake Providence reports that <strong>50% of patients carry Medicaid insurance</strong>. Without that coverage, the clinic and others like it cannot sustain operations.</p>
<p><strong>Acadiana and Southwest Louisiana</strong> face different dynamics. Rural parishes like Vermilion, St. Landry, Evangeline, and Allen contain populations descended from Acadian exile, with distinct cultural patterns and healthcare seeking behaviors. Six rural hospitals in Acadiana face possible closure under proposed Medicaid cuts, including facilities in New Iberia, Mamou, and surrounding parishes.</p>

</table>
<p>Research from the Louisiana Department of Health confirms that <strong>provider growth has concentrated in urban parishes</strong> despite Medicaid expansion. Access to specialists remains more common in urban areas, contributing to persistent disparities between urban and rural populations.</p>
<p><strong>Health Outcomes</strong></p>
<p>Louisiana&rsquo;s rural parishes demonstrate outcomes consistent with Delta region patterns. Chartis data ranks Louisiana at the <strong>90th percentile for adult obesity</strong> among rural communities nationally and the <strong>92nd percentile for diabetes</strong> prevalence. Premature death rates hover near the 90th percentile alongside Alabama, Arkansas, and Mississippi.</p>

<p>The state&rsquo;s Medicaid infrastructure represents nearly a decade of investment that RHTP can leverage. Work requirements begin in 2027, requiring people aged 19 to 64 to prove they work 80 hours per month for coverage eligibility. Enrollees must verify eligibility every six months starting December 31, 2026. In October 2028, Medicaid expansion enrollees will face a $35 copay requirement.</p>

<h2 id="state-approach">State Approach<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#state-approach">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Governance Structure</strong></p>
<p><strong>Louisiana Department of Health (LDH)</strong> serves as lead agency. LDH Secretary <strong>Stephen R. Russo</strong> and Medicaid Director <strong>Julie Foster Hagan</strong> oversee implementation. The department issued a Request for Information (RFI) in September 2025 soliciting stakeholder input on implementation strategies.</p>
<p>LDH&rsquo;s vision emphasizes <strong>transformative changes with long-lasting health impacts</strong> for rural Louisianans. The September 2025 RFI sought recommendations from hospitals, healthcare providers, academic institutions, community-based organizations, technology suppliers, and rural residents.</p>
<p><strong>Strategic Framework</strong></p>
<p>Louisiana organized its approach around seven primary initiatives:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Telehealth Infrastructure</strong>: Technology deployment for remote specialty access</li>
<li><strong>Community Paramedicine</strong>: EMS-based chronic disease management and prevention</li>
<li><strong>Workforce Pipeline</strong>: Training and retention programs for rural providers</li>
<li><strong>PACE Site Expansion</strong>: Retrofitting rural hospital spaces for comprehensive elderly care</li>
<li><strong>Care Navigation and CHW Deployment</strong>: Community health worker services and SDOH screening</li>
<li><strong>Data Analytics</strong>: Enhanced monitoring and program adjustment capabilities</li>
<li><strong>Value-Based Payment Pilots</strong>: Alternative payment models with managed care organizations</li>
</ol>
<p>The state explicitly seeks to <strong>strengthen local healthcare systems, embed technology in rural communities, and expand workforce capacity</strong> while improving access to care and healthcare delivery.</p>

<p><strong>SDOH/HRSN Initiatives</strong></p>
<p>Louisiana&rsquo;s RHTP application incorporates <strong>SDOH screening and health-related social needs navigation</strong> as components of the care navigation initiative. The state&rsquo;s RFI explicitly sought input on strategies addressing social problems that lead to poor health, including food insecurity, housing, transportation, utilities assistance, furthering education, and mental health connections.</p>
<p><strong>Community Health Worker Programs</strong></p>
<p>Louisiana maintains <strong>established CHW infrastructure</strong> that positions the state for RHTP-funded expansion:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>HB 587 (2023)</strong> established the Louisiana Community Health Worker Workforce Board within LDH</li>
<li><strong>Louisiana CHW Institute</strong> at LSU Health Sciences Center provides training and workforce development</li>
<li><strong>LACHON</strong> (Louisiana Community Health Outreach Network) coordinates CHW training and community health outreach</li>
<li><strong>Medicaid reimbursement</strong> for CHW services exists under state plan as professional services billed incident to supervising providers</li>
<li>FQHCs, RHCs, and American Indian clinics use <strong>HCPCS codes T1015, H2020, or D0999</strong> for CHW services</li>
<li>MCOs may reimburse CHW services through their own contracts in addition to state plan requirements</li>
</ul>
<p>The Louisiana CHW Workforce Coalition is co-led by LACHON and the Louisiana CHW Institute, with membership including LDH Office of Public Health, managed care organizations, community-based organizations, Louisiana Primary Care Association, and health systems.</p>
<p><strong>CIE Platform Status</strong></p>
<p>Louisiana does not have a statewide closed-loop referral platform currently deployed. The state&rsquo;s 211 system provides resource directory services but lacks the bidirectional referral tracking that characterizes community information exchange platforms. RHTP implementation may include <strong>procurement for referral platform infrastructure</strong> as part of care navigation enhancement.</p>

<p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
<p><strong>Medicaid Expansion Foundation</strong>. Louisiana enters RHTP implementation with <strong>advantages unavailable to non-expansion states</strong>. The 2016 expansion created infrastructure, relationships, and revenue streams that RHTP can enhance. More than 600,000 residents gained coverage. Hospitals that would have closed survived. FQHCs expanded capacity. Provider networks grew.</p>
<p><strong>Established MCO Infrastructure</strong>. The state&rsquo;s managed care infrastructure provides <strong>established distribution channels</strong> for RHTP funding. Rather than building new contracting relationships, LDH can modify existing MCO contracts to incorporate RHTP requirements.</p>
<p><strong>CHW Workforce Infrastructure</strong>. Louisiana&rsquo;s <strong>existing CHW reimbursement and training infrastructure</strong> positions the state ahead of peers lacking established pathways. The 2023 legislation creating the CHW Workforce Board provides governance structure for expansion.</p>
<p><strong>Data and Analytics Capacity</strong>. LDH&rsquo;s <strong>Healthy Louisiana Dashboard</strong> demonstrated sophisticated use of data for program monitoring and adjustment. The dashboard tracked Medicaid utilization by parish in real time, allowing targeted intervention. This capacity transfers to RHTP implementation.</p>
<p><strong>Vulnerabilities</strong></p>
<p><strong>Coverage Erosion Under Medicaid Cuts</strong>. Louisiana&rsquo;s primary vulnerability is coverage loss. Work requirements projected to remove up to 132,000 Louisianans from Medicaid begin in 2027. Rural parishes with the highest Medicaid enrollment face the greatest exposure. East Carroll Parish illustrates the risk: <strong>64% of residents carry Medicaid coverage</strong>. Work requirements targeting this population would devastate providers dependent on Medicaid revenue. RHTP cannot backfill coverage losses.</p>
<p><strong>Net Negative Fiscal Position</strong>. Louisiana will invest approximately $1 billion through RHTP while losing $2 billion or more through Medicaid reductions over the five-year period. The arithmetic produces <strong>net loss</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>At-Risk Hospital Concentration</strong>. With <strong>27 hospitals (48%) at risk of closure</strong> and 9 at immediate risk, Louisiana faces among the highest rural hospital vulnerability rates nationally. RHTP infrastructure investment cannot compensate for facilities that close before transformation takes effect.</p>
<p><strong>Urban Provider Concentration</strong>. Provider growth concentrated in urban parishes despite expansion. Rural parishes gained coverage but did not gain proportional provider growth. RHTP workforce initiatives must overcome structural barriers that expansion alone could not address.</p>
<p><strong>Sustainability Prospects</strong></p>

<p>Louisiana&rsquo;s <strong>PACE site expansion</strong> represents potentially durable transformation. Retrofitting rural hospital spaces for Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly creates physical infrastructure that persists beyond RHTP. PACE programs serve Medicare and Medicaid dual-eligible populations with comprehensive wraparound services, generating sustainable revenue.</p>
<p><strong>CHW program sustainability</strong> depends on continued Medicaid reimbursement. Louisiana&rsquo;s state plan authority for CHW services provides foundation, but reimbursement rates and covered services could face pressure under Medicaid restructuring.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Success Factors</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Coverage preservation</strong>: Minimizing Medicaid losses under work requirements determines whether expansion infrastructure survives</li>
<li><strong>MCO engagement</strong>: Managed care organizations must actively support RHTP initiatives through network and payment modifications</li>
<li><strong>Provider retention</strong>: Workforce investments must produce providers who remain in rural practice beyond training periods</li>
<li><strong>Hospital stabilization</strong>: At-risk facilities must survive long enough for transformation initiatives to take effect</li>
<li><strong>CHW integration</strong>: Community health worker services must demonstrate value to sustain Medicaid reimbursement</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>Louisiana&rsquo;s RHTP implementation represents <strong>leveraged investment on existing infrastructure</strong>. The state&rsquo;s 2016 Medicaid expansion created a foundation unavailable to non-expansion states. RHTP can enhance that foundation, expanding workforce capacity, building technology infrastructure, and improving care delivery for covered populations.</p>
<p>The fundamental threat lies outside RHTP&rsquo;s scope. Medicaid cuts projected to remove 132,000 or more Louisianans from coverage will erode the revenue base supporting rural hospitals and clinics. East Carroll Parish demonstrates what happens when coverage reaches 64% of residents: the entire health system depends on Medicaid revenue. Remove that coverage and the system collapses regardless of RHTP investment.</p>
<p>Louisiana&rsquo;s <strong>$208 million FY2026 award</strong> provides meaningful resources for transformation. The state&rsquo;s established CHW workforce and Medicaid infrastructure offer implementation advantages. LDH&rsquo;s track record with data-driven program management suggests capacity for effective oversight.</p>
<p>The state cannot, however, transform a system while that system&rsquo;s financial foundation erodes. Louisiana built rural health infrastructure on Medicaid expansion. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act takes that foundation away with one hand while offering RHTP investment with the other. The arithmetic produces <strong>net loss</strong> when all federal healthcare funding is considered together.</p>
<p><strong>What to Watch</strong></p>
<p>Monitor <strong>coverage losses under work requirements</strong> as they phase in beginning 2027. The 132,000 estimate may prove conservative. East Carroll Parish and similar Delta parishes will demonstrate impact earliest as populations with highest Medicaid dependence face administrative barriers.</p>
<p>Track <strong>rural hospital financial indicators</strong> as expansion revenue declines. Facilities identified at risk, including Iberia Medical Center, Savoy Medical Center, Hood Memorial Hospital, and hospitals in Ruston, Bogalusa, and Bastrop, will signal whether RHTP infrastructure investment can compensate for coverage losses.</p>
<p>Observe <strong>PACE site development</strong> as potential model for sustainable transformation. If Louisiana successfully retrofits rural hospital spaces for comprehensive elderly care, the model may prove replicable across states seeking post-acute care alternatives.</p>
<p>Evaluate <strong>CHW program expansion</strong> under RHTP. Louisiana&rsquo;s existing infrastructure provides baseline; RHTP-funded growth will test whether the state can scale community health worker deployment to address SDOH systematically.</p>
