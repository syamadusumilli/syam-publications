  "articleBody": "The Rural Health Transformation Program provides $50 billion over five years while Congress simultaneously reduces Medicaid spending by $911 billion over ten years. The arithmetic is not complicated. KFF estimates that federal Medicaid spending in rural areas alone will decline by $137 to $155 billion over the same period. The program was added to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act specifically to address political concerns about rural hospital closures that would follow the legislation’s Medicaid provisions, giving rural-state Republicans something to reference when constituents asked why their hospital closed. RHTP is not a solution to the Medicaid cuts but a consolation prize, and the statute explicitly prohibits using transformation funds to replace lost Medicaid revenue.\nUnderstanding this gap requires examining how rural communities depend on Medicaid and how the One Big Beautiful Bill Act restructures that foundation. Medicaid covers approximately 85 million Americans, with rural residents relying on the program at higher rates than urban populations. Rural hospitals depend on Medicaid revenue in ways that urban facilities do not. The 2,086 rural hospitals operating as of May 2025 received $12.2 billion annually in net Medicaid revenue, with the median facility receiving $3.9 million per year. Rural hospitals operate on margins averaging 3.1 percent, with 44 percent already operating at negative margins. Any revenue reduction threatens viability, and Medicaid cuts translate directly into operating losses that small-margin facilities cannot absorb.\nCritical Access Hospitals face particular exposure. The 1,350 CAHs nationwide serve as sole providers in many rural communities, with their 25-bed limit and geographic isolation preventing them from achieving economies of scale or attracting commercially insured patients to cross-subsidize Medicaid losses. Federally Qualified Health Centers depend on Medicaid for 40 to 60 percent of revenue depending on location, meaning Medicaid payment adequacy determines whether these safety net providers can maintain services or recruit providers. The Medicaid-to-Medicare fee index averages approximately 72 percent nationally, with some states paying as low as 50 percent of Medicare rates. Providers limit Medicaid patient panels because treating them generates losses, but rural providers with high Medicaid patient shares cannot limit panels without abandoning their mission.\nThe One Big Beautiful Bill Act restructures Medicaid financing from an open-ended federal match to a per capita cap system beginning in fiscal year 2027. Currently, the federal government matches state Medicaid spending at rates ranging from 50 to 77 percent depending on state income levels. States spend what they need, and the federal government matches. Per capita caps limit federal contributions regardless of actual costs. If actual per-enrollee costs exceed the cap, states absorb 100 percent of the excess. The cap growth rate matters enormously because medical costs historically grow faster than general inflation. Within a decade, caps cover a declining share of actual costs, forcing states to either increase spending or reduce services.\nThe legislation mandates work requirements for Medicaid expansion adults beginning October 1, 2027. Adults aged 19 to 64 enrolled through ACA expansion must document 80 hours monthly of work, job training, education, or community service to maintain coverage. Arkansas implemented work requirements in 2018 before courts blocked them, and during nine months of implementation, more than 18,000 people lost coverage. Research found that most who lost coverage were actually working but failed to navigate reporting requirements. Rural implementation poses particular challenges around documentation, seasonal employment, childcare, and transportation. Rural residents work in agriculture, gig economy, and informal employment that generates no automatic documentation. Agricultural work is seasonal, with workers meeting 80-hour requirements during harvest but not during winter months. CBO estimates that work requirements will cause 7.5 million people to lose Medicaid coverage by 2034, with rural areas bearing disproportionate impact.\nStates that expanded Medicaid currently receive enhanced federal matching at 90 percent of expansion costs, compared to 50 to 77 percent for traditional Medicaid populations. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act reduces this enhanced match to 85 percent in fiscal 2027, 80 percent in fiscal 2028, 75 percent in fiscal 2029, 72 percent in fiscal 2030, and 70 percent from fiscal 2031 forward. The 20-percentage-point reduction shifts billions in costs to states, which must either increase state spending to maintain coverage or reduce enrollment and benefits. Recent expansion states face the steepest fiscal cliffs. North Carolina expanded in 2023 and Georgia implemented partial expansion with work requirements the same year, with both states building coverage infrastructure assuming 90 percent federal support. The legislation also freezes provider taxes that states use to finance their share of Medicaid costs, preventing states from increasing provider tax rates or implementing new provider taxes exactly when the enhanced match reduction increases state obligations.\nMultiple analyses quantify the gap between Medicaid cuts and RHTP investment in ways that converge on the same conclusion. KFF’s analysis estimates a $137 to $155 billion reduction in federal Medicaid spending in rural areas over ten years, meaning the rural Medicaid gap alone exceeds RHTP by $87 to $105 billion. Manatt analysis for the National Rural Health Association estimates a $58 billion reduction in federal Medicaid funds to rural hospitals specifically over ten years, a narrower framing that still exceeds RHTP’s five-year $50 billion when accounting for the program’s restrictions on direct hospital support. The American Hospital Association found that key Medicaid provisions would reduce federal Medicaid spending on rural hospitals by $50.4 billion over ten years, with 1.8 million rural residents losing coverage by 2034. The Center for American Progress notes that if every rural hospital received equal shares of the $50 billion, each would receive $4.5 million annually for five years, and many rural hospitals lose more than that from Medicaid cuts alone.\nThe gap analysis understates the problem because RHTP front-loads funding while Medicaid cuts back-load impact. RHTP distributes $50 billion from fiscal 2026 through fiscal 2030, with all funds required to be obligated by October 1, 2032. Medicaid cuts accelerate after fiscal 2030, with KFF analysis finding that 64 percent of ten-year Medicaid reductions occur after 2030. Work requirements phase in during fiscal 2027, per capita caps tighten over time, and enhanced match reductions compound. States receive RHTP support before the worst Medicaid cuts arrive, and when RHTP ends in 2030, the steepest Medicaid reductions are just beginning. The timing mismatch means states experience temporary assistance followed by permanent austerity.\nSection 5201(g) of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act explicitly prohibits using RHTP funds to “offset reductions in Federal medical assistance percentage or other reductions in Federal Medicaid spending.” New Jersey acknowledged this restriction in its application while noting the state faced $3.3 billion in projected hospital and public health funding cuts from the broader legislation. The prohibition reflects RHTP’s design as transformation funding rather than maintenance funding, with Congress intending to fund new capabilities and system changes rather than sustain existing operations. States can use RHTP to fund telehealth infrastructure creating new access pathways, train community health workers extending provider capacity, or implement care coordination systems improving outcomes. States cannot use RHTP to cover operating losses from Medicaid payment reductions, replace Medicaid revenue that previously supported existing services, or maintain current staffing levels that Medicaid cuts would otherwise reduce.\nThe non-backfill rule creates contradictory pressures that undermine transformation objectives. Hospitals losing Medicaid revenue need operating funds to avoid closure, but RHTP cannot provide operating funds, forcing hospitals to find alternative revenue sources while simultaneously implementing transformation activities that RHTP does fund. Implementing new care models requires organizational capacity, but organizations fighting for survival lack capacity for innovation, meaning RHTP funds transformation in facilities too distressed to transform. RHTP can fund workforce recruitment and retention, but workforce investments assume facilities remain open, and a hospital that closes cannot retain workers regardless of loan repayment programs or signing bonuses. The rule ensures RHTP does not become a slush fund for hospital bailouts while also ensuring RHTP cannot address the core problem that Medicaid cuts create.\nState responses vary based on expansion status and political dynamics. Expansion states defend existing coverage by lobbying Congress for enhanced match restoration or slower phase-down while absorbing increasing costs through state budgets or reducing optional benefits to offset mandatory coverage costs. Non-expansion states face different calculations, with the coverage gap persisting for 1.4 million Texans, 500,000 Floridians, and hundreds of thousands of others who remain uninsured. Hospital closures accelerate in non-expansion states that already experience higher closure rates, with Medicaid cuts compounding existing revenue deficits. Facilities operating at negative margins cannot absorb additional losses, yet political dynamics prevent expansion because Medicaid expansion remains perceived as Democratic\n",

<div class="post-content">
<p>The Rural Health Transformation Program provides $50 billion over five years while Congress simultaneously reduces Medicaid spending by $911 billion over ten years. The arithmetic is not complicated. KFF estimates that federal Medicaid spending in rural areas alone will decline by $137 to $155 billion over the same period. The program was added to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act specifically to address political concerns about rural hospital closures that would follow the legislation&rsquo;s Medicaid provisions, giving rural-state Republicans something to reference when constituents asked why their hospital closed. RHTP is not a solution to the Medicaid cuts but a consolation prize, and the statute explicitly prohibits using transformation funds to replace lost Medicaid revenue.</p>
<p>Understanding this gap requires examining how rural communities depend on Medicaid and how the One Big Beautiful Bill Act restructures that foundation. Medicaid covers approximately 85 million Americans, with rural residents relying on the program at higher rates than urban populations. Rural hospitals depend on Medicaid revenue in ways that urban facilities do not. The 2,086 rural hospitals operating as of May 2025 received $12.2 billion annually in net Medicaid revenue, with the median facility receiving $3.9 million per year. <strong>Rural hospitals operate on margins averaging 3.1 percent, with 44 percent already operating at negative margins.</strong> Any revenue reduction threatens viability, and Medicaid cuts translate directly into operating losses that small-margin facilities cannot absorb.</p>
<p>Critical Access Hospitals face particular exposure. The 1,350 CAHs nationwide serve as sole providers in many rural communities, with their 25-bed limit and geographic isolation preventing them from achieving economies of scale or attracting commercially insured patients to cross-subsidize Medicaid losses. Federally Qualified Health Centers depend on Medicaid for 40 to 60 percent of revenue depending on location, meaning Medicaid payment adequacy determines whether these safety net providers can maintain services or recruit providers. The Medicaid-to-Medicare fee index averages approximately 72 percent nationally, with some states paying as low as 50 percent of Medicare rates. <strong>Providers limit Medicaid patient panels because treating them generates losses,</strong> but rural providers with high Medicaid patient shares cannot limit panels without abandoning their mission.</p>
<p>The One Big Beautiful Bill Act restructures Medicaid financing from an open-ended federal match to a per capita cap system beginning in fiscal year 2027. Currently, the federal government matches state Medicaid spending at rates ranging from 50 to 77 percent depending on state income levels. States spend what they need, and the federal government matches. Per capita caps limit federal contributions regardless of actual costs. If actual per-enrollee costs exceed the cap, states absorb 100 percent of the excess. The cap growth rate matters enormously because medical costs historically grow faster than general inflation. Within a decade, caps cover a declining share of actual costs, forcing states to either increase spending or reduce services.</p>
<p>The legislation mandates work requirements for Medicaid expansion adults beginning October 1, 2027. Adults aged 19 to 64 enrolled through ACA expansion must document 80 hours monthly of work, job training, education, or community service to maintain coverage. Arkansas implemented work requirements in 2018 before courts blocked them, and during nine months of implementation, more than 18,000 people lost coverage. Research found that most who lost coverage were actually working but failed to navigate reporting requirements. <strong>Rural implementation poses particular challenges around documentation, seasonal employment, childcare, and transportation.</strong> Rural residents work in agriculture, gig economy, and informal employment that generates no automatic documentation. Agricultural work is seasonal, with workers meeting 80-hour requirements during harvest but not during winter months. CBO estimates that work requirements will cause 7.5 million people to lose Medicaid coverage by 2034, with rural areas bearing disproportionate impact.</p>
<p>States that expanded Medicaid currently receive enhanced federal matching at 90 percent of expansion costs, compared to 50 to 77 percent for traditional Medicaid populations. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act reduces this enhanced match to 85 percent in fiscal 2027, 80 percent in fiscal 2028, 75 percent in fiscal 2029, 72 percent in fiscal 2030, and 70 percent from fiscal 2031 forward. The 20-percentage-point reduction shifts billions in costs to states, which must either increase state spending to maintain coverage or reduce enrollment and benefits. Recent expansion states face the steepest fiscal cliffs. North Carolina expanded in 2023 and Georgia implemented partial expansion with work requirements the same year, with both states building coverage infrastructure assuming 90 percent federal support. The legislation also freezes provider taxes that states use to finance their share of Medicaid costs, preventing states from increasing provider tax rates or implementing new provider taxes exactly when the enhanced match reduction increases state obligations.</p>
<p>Multiple analyses quantify the gap between Medicaid cuts and RHTP investment in ways that converge on the same conclusion. <strong>KFF&rsquo;s analysis estimates a $137 to $155 billion reduction in federal Medicaid spending in rural areas over ten years, meaning the rural Medicaid gap alone exceeds RHTP by $87 to $105 billion.</strong> Manatt analysis for the National Rural Health Association estimates a $58 billion reduction in federal Medicaid funds to rural hospitals specifically over ten years, a narrower framing that still exceeds RHTP&rsquo;s five-year $50 billion when accounting for the program&rsquo;s restrictions on direct hospital support. The American Hospital Association found that key Medicaid provisions would reduce federal Medicaid spending on rural hospitals by $50.4 billion over ten years, with 1.8 million rural residents losing coverage by 2034. The Center for American Progress notes that if every rural hospital received equal shares of the $50 billion, each would receive $4.5 million annually for five years, and many rural hospitals lose more than that from Medicaid cuts alone.</p>
<p>The gap analysis understates the problem because RHTP front-loads funding while Medicaid cuts back-load impact. RHTP distributes $50 billion from fiscal 2026 through fiscal 2030, with all funds required to be obligated by October 1, 2032. Medicaid cuts accelerate after fiscal 2030, with KFF analysis finding that 64 percent of ten-year Medicaid reductions occur after 2030. Work requirements phase in during fiscal 2027, per capita caps tighten over time, and enhanced match reductions compound. <strong>States receive RHTP support before the worst Medicaid cuts arrive, and when RHTP ends in 2030, the steepest Medicaid reductions are just beginning.</strong> The timing mismatch means states experience temporary assistance followed by permanent austerity.</p>
<p>Section 5201(g) of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act explicitly prohibits using RHTP funds to &ldquo;offset reductions in Federal medical assistance percentage or other reductions in Federal Medicaid spending.&rdquo; New Jersey acknowledged this restriction in its application while noting the state faced $3.3 billion in projected hospital and public health funding cuts from the broader legislation. The prohibition reflects RHTP&rsquo;s design as transformation funding rather than maintenance funding, with Congress intending to fund new capabilities and system changes rather than sustain existing operations. States can use RHTP to fund telehealth infrastructure creating new access pathways, train community health workers extending provider capacity, or implement care coordination systems improving outcomes. States cannot use RHTP to cover operating losses from Medicaid payment reductions, replace Medicaid revenue that previously supported existing services, or maintain current staffing levels that Medicaid cuts would otherwise reduce.</p>
<p>The non-backfill rule creates contradictory pressures that undermine transformation objectives. Hospitals losing Medicaid revenue need operating funds to avoid closure, but RHTP cannot provide operating funds, forcing hospitals to find alternative revenue sources while simultaneously implementing transformation activities that RHTP does fund. Implementing new care models requires organizational capacity, but organizations fighting for survival lack capacity for innovation, meaning RHTP funds transformation in facilities too distressed to transform. RHTP can fund workforce recruitment and retention, but workforce investments assume facilities remain open, and a hospital that closes cannot retain workers regardless of loan repayment programs or signing bonuses. The rule ensures RHTP does not become a slush fund for hospital bailouts while also ensuring RHTP cannot address the core problem that Medicaid cuts create.</p>
<p>State responses vary based on expansion status and political dynamics. Expansion states defend existing coverage by lobbying Congress for enhanced match restoration or slower phase-down while absorbing increasing costs through state budgets or reducing optional benefits to offset mandatory coverage costs. Non-expansion states face different calculations, with the coverage gap persisting for 1.4 million Texans, 500,000 Floridians, and hundreds of thousands of others who remain uninsured. Hospital closures accelerate in non-expansion states that already experience higher closure rates, with Medicaid cuts compounding existing revenue deficits. Facilities operating at negative margins cannot absorb additional losses, yet political dynamics prevent expansion because Medicaid expansion remains perceived as Democratic</p>
