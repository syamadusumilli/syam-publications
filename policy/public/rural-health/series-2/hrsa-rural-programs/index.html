  "articleBody": " “NHSC clinicians provided care to an estimated 19.3 million patients in 2023.” Congressional Research Service\nIntroduction The Rural Health Transformation Program commands attention because of its scale: $50 billion over five years. But HRSA programs have been building rural health infrastructure for decades with less fanfare and smaller budgets. These programs form the foundation on which RHTP transformation efforts rest. States cannot effectively deploy transformation funds without understanding the workforce pipelines, safety net providers, and technical assistance networks that HRSA has constructed over forty years.\nThe Health Resources and Services Administration operates through the Federal Office of Rural Health Policy (FORHP), established in 1987 to advise the HHS Secretary on rural health matters. FORHP administers grant programs, conducts policy analysis, and coordinates federal rural health activities. But HRSA’s rural impact extends far beyond FORHP. The Bureau of Health Workforce runs the National Health Service Corps. The Bureau of Primary Health Care funds Community Health Centers. These programs collectively represent several billion dollars annually in rural health investment.\nRHTP does not replace HRSA programs. It builds on them. States leveraging RHTP effectively will integrate transformation initiatives with existing workforce recruitment, safety net capacity, and technical assistance infrastructure. States treating RHTP as standalone funding will waste resources recreating what already exists.\nThis article maps the HRSA landscape that RHTP transformation must navigate.\nNational Health Service Corps Program Architecture The National Health Service Corps (NHSC) was created by the Emergency Health Personnel Act of 1970 to address provider shortages in underserved areas. The program operates through three mechanisms: scholarships for students in health professions programs, loan repayment for practicing clinicians, and state loan repayment programs with federal matching funds.\nThe core bargain is simple. Federal investment in education costs in exchange for service commitment in Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs). Scholarship recipients receive tuition, fees, and monthly stipends during training. Loan repayment participants receive funds to pay down educational debt. Both require service at NHSC-approved sites located in federally designated shortage areas.\nThe FY2026 budget request supports an estimated 12,800 primary medical care, dental, and behavioral health providers, including through more than 6,600 new scholarships and loan repayment agreements. These providers can serve at more than 22,600 eligible sites and care for more than 18 million patients regardless of ability to pay.\nLoan Repayment Programs NHSC operates multiple loan repayment tracks targeting different workforce needs:\nStandard Loan Repayment Program offers up to $50,000 for two years of full-time service or $25,000 for two years of half-time service. Participants can continue for additional service periods with continued loan repayment. HPSA score thresholds determine placement priority.\nSubstance Use Disorder Workforce Loan Repayment provides up to $75,000 for three years of service at approved SUD treatment facilities. This program addresses the behavioral health workforce crisis in rural communities struggling with opioid and methamphetamine epidemics.\nRural Community Loan Repayment Program coordinates with the Rural Communities Opioid Response Program (RCORP) from FORHP. Awards reach up to $105,000 for full-time participants and $55,000 for half-time participants, including a $5,000 enhancement for language access capabilities. The program specifically targets rural providers combating opioid use disorder.\nStudent to Service Loan Repayment targets medical students and residents committing to primary care service before completing training. The program helps lock in workforce commitments early, addressing the leakage that occurs when students change specialties or locations after graduation.\nScholarship Program NHSC scholarships cover tuition, required fees, and provide monthly living stipends for students in primary care medicine, dentistry, physician assistant programs, nurse practitioner programs, and certified nurse midwifery. Recipients commit to service after graduation in HPSAs of greatest need, defined by minimum HPSA scores that vary by provider type.\nFor class year 2025, NHSC scholars must serve at sites with HPSA scores of 19 or above for primary care physicians and nurse practitioners, 5 or above for primary care physician assistants, and 16 or above for nurse midwives. These thresholds ensure scholarship recipients deploy to the most underserved areas rather than moderate shortage areas.\nFunding Uncertainty NHSC funding creates ongoing anxiety for program administrators and participants. The program now draws primarily from the Community Health Center Fund (CHCF), a mandatory appropriation representing more than 70% of annual NHSC funding. But CHCF is time-limited, requiring periodic reauthorization.\nThe fund has been extended several times, most recently through September 2025. ARPA provided a one-time $800 million infusion in FY2021 that expanded awards but created a funding cliff as those obligations wound down. The FY2022 spike in NHSC field strength reflected ARPA funding; subsequent years saw reduced capacity as supplemental funding exhausted.\nFor rural communities depending on NHSC providers, this funding uncertainty translates to workforce instability. Providers recruited through loan repayment may not be replaceable if program capacity contracts. RHTP workforce initiatives must account for this uncertainty when designing retention strategies that do not depend entirely on federal recruitment subsidies.\nProvider Mix Evolution NHSC composition has shifted dramatically over fifteen years. In FY2009, physicians represented nearly 35% of NHSC providers. By FY2016, physicians had fallen to 21% while behavioral and mental health providers had become the largest category at 30%. By FY2023, 48% of NHSC providers were in behavioral health disciplines, reflecting both the SUD workforce programs and the broader mental health crisis.\nThis shift matters for rural communities. Traditional physician recruitment through NHSC has diminished even as behavioral health recruitment has expanded. Rural hospitals seeking primary care physicians cannot rely on NHSC the way they could a decade ago. Alternative recruitment strategies become necessary.\nCommunity Health Center Program Safety Net Foundation Community Health Centers (CHCs) serve 52 million Americans annually, approximately one in seven Americans and one in three in rural areas. These nonprofit, patient-governed organizations provide comprehensive primary care regardless of ability to pay. CHCs operate as the nation’s largest primary care system, delivering care to 14% of the U.S. population for approximately 1% of total healthcare spending.\nThe approximately 1,400 active Health Center Program grantees operate through more than 17,000 service delivery sites. When including FQHC Look-Alikes (which meet requirements but do not receive Section 330 grants) and their service sites, the total network exceeds 19,000 locations. The CHC workforce has grown to 326,000 full-time employees.\nSection 330 Grants Health Center Program funding flows through Section 330 of the Public Health Service Act. Organizations receiving these grants become Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), gaining access to enhanced Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, malpractice coverage through the Federal Tort Claims Act, access to 340B drug pricing, and eligibility to serve as NHSC placement sites.\nGrant mechanisms include:\nBase operational grants provide core funding for health center operations. These grants support the comprehensive services that health centers must provide regardless of patient volume or payer mix.\nService Area Competition (SAC) awards fund health centers to serve designated geographic areas. SAC grants include protections against other federally-funded health centers entering established service areas.\nNew Access Point (NAP) grants support the establishment of new health center sites or the expansion of existing health centers into new service areas. NAP funding targets unserved low-income populations and considers penetration levels, HPSA scores, and geographic distribution.\nRural Health Center Integration In 2024, one in five rural residents were served by HRSA-funded health centers. Rural FQHCs function as critical safety net infrastructure in communities where other providers have departed or never existed.\nTelehealth has become central to rural FQHC operations. According to the 2024 Community Health Center Chartbook, 92% of rural health centers offered mental health services via telehealth and 60% offered substance use disorder services via telehealth in 2022. Medicare permanently allows FQHCs reimbursement for mental health telehealth visits, including audio-only technology when video is not available.\nFQHCs in rural areas face distinct financial pressures. Capital Link’s 2025 analysis of FQHC financial and operational performance found rural health centers navigating payer mix challenges, staffing constraints, and infrastructure limitations that differ from urban counterparts. Medi-Cal accounts for 77% of net patient revenue at California’s San Joaquin Valley community health centers, illustrating the Medicaid dependence that makes these organizations vulnerable to coverage contraction.\nRHTP Integration Opportunities RHTP transformation initiatives should leverage existing FQHC infrastructure rather than creating parallel systems. FQHCs already possess:\nCommunity relationships built over years of serving populations regardless of insurance status. Trust cannot be manufactured quickly.\nSliding fee scale infrastructure enabling care for uninsured patients. This capacity becomes critical as Medicaid contraction increases the uninsured population.\nBehavioral health integration experience from years of expanding mental health and SUD services. Rural FQHCs have learned what works in resource-constrained environments.\nNHSC site approval enabling workforce recruitment through federal programs. New providers can be directed to existing FQHC platforms rather than requiring new site development.\nStates treating FQHCs as partners in transformation rather than competitors for funding will achieve better outcomes than states building redundant infrastructure.\nMedicare Rural Hospital Flexibility Program Program Purpose The Medicare Rural Hospital Flexibility (Flex) Program, established by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, responded to the rural hospital closure crisis of the 1980s and 1990s. The program created the Critical Access Hospital (CAH) designation that allows small rural hospitals to receive cost-based Medicare reimbursement rather than prospective payment rates.\nFlex serves 1,360 CAHs across the United States through state-administered grants. The overall goal is ensuring high-quality healthcare, including preventive, ambulatory, pre-hospital, emergent, and inpatient care, remains available in rural communities aligned with community needs.\nState Grant Structure State Offices of Rural Health (SORHs) carry out the Flex Program. Federal grants flow to designated state entities that then provide technical assistance tailored to CAH needs within their states. The current funding cycle runs FY2024 through FY2028.\nRequired program components include:\nCAH Quality Improvement through MBQIP. The Medicare Beneficiary Quality Improvement Project seeks to improve care quality by increasing voluntary data reporting and driving improvement activities based on reported metrics. Nearly 100% of participating CAHs voluntarily report quality measures.\nCAH Financial and Operational Improvement. Technical assistance addresses revenue cycle, expense management, strategic planning, and operational efficiency. Over 40% of participants improved on financial measures after participating in improvement activities.\nAdditional Flex activities include CAH designation support for hospitals seeking conversion, population health initiatives, and rural emergency medical services integration.\nTechnical Assistance Networks Flex creates infrastructure that RHTP can leverage. The National Rural Health Resource Center’s Technical Assistance and Services Center provides information, tools, and education across all five Flex program areas. Stratis Health provides quality improvement technical assistance through FORHP-supported cooperative agreements.\nState Flex programs have developed relationships with every CAH in their states. They understand local challenges, leadership capabilities, and improvement opportunities. RHTP initiatives that bypass this existing infrastructure waste time rebuilding knowledge that already exists.\nRHTP transformation requiring CAH participation should route through Flex programs. The technical assistance capacity, quality improvement frameworks, and established relationships represent sunk costs that transformation initiatives can leverage at no additional expense.\nState Offices of Rural Health Federal-State Partnership Every state maintains a State Office of Rural Health (SORH), typically funded through HRSA grants and state appropriations. These offices serve as information clearinghouses, technical assistance coordinators, and federal program liaisons for rural health stakeholders within their states.\nSORH functions include:\nInformation clearinghouse operations providing rural health data, program information, and resource directories to providers, communities, and policymakers within the state.\nProvider recruitment assistance helping rural communities identify, attract, and retain healthcare providers through recruitment strategies, incentive programs, and community support development.\nProgram coordination connecting rural providers and communities with appropriate federal and state programs, including NHSC placement, Flex participation, and grant opportunities.\nPolicy development support informing state policy decisions with rural health data, perspectives, and analysis.\nRHTP Implementation Role RHTP requires states to engage SORHs in application development and implementation planning. This consultation requirement recognizes that SORHs possess institutional knowledge that centralized state agencies lack. They know which communities face immediate crisis, which providers are considering departure, and which infrastructure investments would yield greatest impact.\nStates that treat SORH consultation as a checkbox exercise rather than substantive partnership will develop transformation plans disconnected from ground reality. States that integrate SORH expertise into planning and implementation will avoid the naive assumptions that waste transformation resources.\nRural Residency Planning and Development Training Pipeline Programs The Rural Residency Planning and Development (RRPD) Program addresses the fundamental workforce challenge: most physicians practice within 100 miles of where they completed residency. Creating rural residency programs increases the probability that physicians will remain in rural practice.\nHRSA anticipates 14 RRPD awards of up to $750,000 each in 2026 for developing new accredited rural residency programs or Rural Track Programs. Eligible specialties include family medicine, internal medicine, preventive medicine, psychiatry, general surgery, and obstetrics-gynecology.\nTeaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education provides federal funding for residency programs operated by FQHCs and other community-based ambulatory care settings. This program creates residency slots in safety net settings serving underserved populations, increasing the pipeline of physicians with training experience relevant to rural and underserved practice.\nRHTP Alignment RHTP explicitly authorizes workforce recruitment and retention expenditures with minimum five-year commitment requirements. States can use transformation funds to supplement federal residency support, creating stronger incentives for rural training program development.\nThe combination of RRPD startup grants and RHTP sustainability funding could enable residency programs that neither funding stream could support alone. This represents the coordination opportunity that federal program fragmentation usually prevents.\nHHS Restructuring Implications Administration for a Healthy America On March 27, 2025, HHS announced a dramatic restructuring creating the Administration for a Healthy America (AHA). This new entity consolidates five existing HHS operating divisions: the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health (OASH), HRSA, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).\nAccording to HHS, AHA will include divisions for Primary Care, Maternal and Child Health, Mental Health, Environmental Health, HIV/AIDS, and Workforce. The stated purpose is “more efficiently coordinat[ing] chronic care and disease prevention programs and harmoniz[ing] health resources to low-income Americans.”\nProgram Continuity Questions The restructuring raises significant questions for rural health programs. HRSA’s Bureau of Health Workforce manages NHSC. HRSA’s Bureau of Primary Health Care funds community health centers. FORHP administers Flex and rural grant programs. How these functions will operate within AHA divisions remains unclear.\nThe FY2026 budget request submitted after the restructuring announcement described AHA divisions and their proposed functions, but operational details remain uncertain. Congressional Research Service analysis notes that statutory authorization for various HRSA programs may constrain administrative restructuring, raising questions about legal authority for proposed changes.\nOn May 5, 2025, nineteen states and the District of Columbia filed suit challenging the reorganization. On July 1, 2025, a federal district court issued a preliminary injunction finding the reorganization likely violated the Administrative Procedure Act and blocking implementation of workforce reductions and restructuring.\nRural Health Stakes The outcome matters for rural health transformation. If AHA restructuring fragments HRSA institutional knowledge or disrupts grant administration, states lose technical assistance capacity precisely when RHTP implementation requires support. If the restructuring improves coordination across previously siloed programs, rural communities could benefit from more integrated federal engagement.\nStates cannot control federal restructuring outcomes, but they can maintain relationships with program staff regardless of organizational chart changes. Individual expertise and established partnerships often persist through reorganization even when official structures shift.\nThe External View Workforce Pipeline Assessments The Association of American Medical Colleges projects the U.S. will face a shortage of 54,100 to 139,000 physicians by 2033, including shortfalls in both primary and specialty care. Rural areas already experience these shortages; national projections represent future urban reality catching up to current rural conditions.\nResearch on NHSC effectiveness finds positive results. A 2021 study discovered that NHSC clinicians in community health centers increased medical and behavioral health care visits without increasing service costs. NHSC clinicians reduced behavioral health costs by $3.55 per visit in CHCs and $7.95 per visit in rural CHCs specifically.\nProvider Association Perspectives The National Association of Community Health Centers advocates for stable CHCF reauthorization and NHSC expansion. The National Rural Health Association emphasizes Flex program importance for CAH sustainability. State associations of rural health clinics and hospitals lobby for payment adequacy alongside workforce programs.\nThese perspectives reflect institutional dependence on federal programs that have become essential infrastructure. Rural health delivery in 2026 cannot be disentangled from the federal programs that built it. RHTP transformation operates within this context, not outside it.\nPolitics and Policy Community Health Center Fund Reauthorization The time-limited nature of mandatory NHSC and health center funding creates recurring political uncertainty. Reauthorization cycles become opportunities for policy changes that program administrators and beneficiaries cannot predict. The September 2025 CHCF extension represents the latest in a series of short-term fixes that prevent long-term planning.\nStable authorization would benefit rural health workforce planning. Providers considering loan repayment commitments face uncertainty about whether programs will continue for their full service period. Communities investing in NHSC recruitment cannot know whether replacement providers will be available when current participants complete obligations.\nHHS Reorganization Implementation Legal challenges to HHS restructuring remain active. The July 2025 preliminary injunction blocks implementation but may be overturned on appeal or through compliance with procedural requirements. Congress continues oversight hearings examining reorganization authority and program impacts.\nStates depending on HRSA technical assistance should monitor litigation outcomes. Program disruption remains possible even if current injunctions hold, as administrative capacity may have been reduced before courts intervened.\nRHTP-HRSA Coordination RHTP statute requires coordination with existing federal programs. CMS administers RHTP while HRSA (or AHA) administers workforce and safety net programs. Interagency coordination historically challenges federal health policy. Whether transformation funds and workforce programs will operate in concert or parallel depends on implementation decisions not yet finalized.\nConclusion HRSA programs represent decades of infrastructure investment that RHTP transformation cannot replicate in five years. The National Health Service Corps has placed providers in shortage areas since 1970. Community Health Centers have served millions regardless of ability to pay since the 1960s. Flex has supported Critical Access Hospitals since 1997. State Offices of Rural Health have coordinated federal-state rural health activities for decades.\nRHTP builds on this foundation. States that leverage existing NHSC sites, FQHC networks, Flex technical assistance, and SORH expertise will accomplish more with transformation funds than states attempting to build from scratch.\nThe HHS restructuring introduces uncertainty at an inopportune moment. RHTP implementation requires federal technical assistance that administrative disruption could impair. States should maintain relationships with program staff, track reorganization developments, and plan for scenarios where federal support proves less available than expected.\nHRSA programs will continue regardless of RHTP. They will continue after RHTP sunsets in 2030. Understanding these programs as permanent infrastructure rather than temporary initiatives clarifies the appropriate relationship: RHTP should strengthen systems that will persist, not create parallel structures that will disappear when transformation funding ends.\nAppendix: Key HRSA Rural Program Parameters Program Annual Funding (approx.)

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#introduction">#</a></h2>
<p>The Rural Health Transformation Program commands attention because of its scale: $50 billion over five years. But HRSA programs have been building rural health infrastructure for decades with less fanfare and smaller budgets. <strong>These programs form the foundation on which RHTP transformation efforts rest.</strong> States cannot effectively deploy transformation funds without understanding the workforce pipelines, safety net providers, and technical assistance networks that HRSA has constructed over forty years.</p>
<p>The Health Resources and Services Administration operates through the <strong>Federal Office of Rural Health Policy (FORHP)</strong>, established in 1987 to advise the HHS Secretary on rural health matters. FORHP administers grant programs, conducts policy analysis, and coordinates federal rural health activities. But HRSA&rsquo;s rural impact extends far beyond FORHP. The Bureau of Health Workforce runs the National Health Service Corps. The Bureau of Primary Health Care funds Community Health Centers. These programs collectively represent several billion dollars annually in rural health investment.</p>
<p>RHTP does not replace HRSA programs. It builds on them. States leveraging RHTP effectively will integrate transformation initiatives with existing workforce recruitment, safety net capacity, and technical assistance infrastructure. States treating RHTP as standalone funding will waste resources recreating what already exists.</p>
<p>This article maps the HRSA landscape that RHTP transformation must navigate.</p>

<p>The <strong>National Health Service Corps (NHSC)</strong> was created by the Emergency Health Personnel Act of 1970 to address provider shortages in underserved areas. The program operates through three mechanisms: scholarships for students in health professions programs, loan repayment for practicing clinicians, and state loan repayment programs with federal matching funds.</p>
<p><strong>The core bargain is simple.</strong> Federal investment in education costs in exchange for service commitment in Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs). Scholarship recipients receive tuition, fees, and monthly stipends during training. Loan repayment participants receive funds to pay down educational debt. Both require service at NHSC-approved sites located in federally designated shortage areas.</p>
<p>The FY2026 budget request supports an estimated <strong>12,800 primary medical care, dental, and behavioral health providers</strong>, including through more than 6,600 new scholarships and loan repayment agreements. These providers can serve at more than 22,600 eligible sites and care for more than 18 million patients regardless of ability to pay.</p>
<h3 id="loan-repayment-programs">Loan Repayment Programs<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#loan-repayment-programs">#</a></h3>
<p>NHSC operates multiple loan repayment tracks targeting different workforce needs:</p>
<p><strong>Standard Loan Repayment Program</strong> offers up to $50,000 for two years of full-time service or $25,000 for two years of half-time service. Participants can continue for additional service periods with continued loan repayment. HPSA score thresholds determine placement priority.</p>
<p><strong>Substance Use Disorder Workforce Loan Repayment</strong> provides up to $75,000 for three years of service at approved SUD treatment facilities. This program addresses the behavioral health workforce crisis in rural communities struggling with opioid and methamphetamine epidemics.</p>
<p><strong>Rural Community Loan Repayment Program</strong> coordinates with the Rural Communities Opioid Response Program (RCORP) from FORHP. Awards reach up to $105,000 for full-time participants and $55,000 for half-time participants, including a $5,000 enhancement for language access capabilities. The program specifically targets rural providers combating opioid use disorder.</p>
<p><strong>Student to Service Loan Repayment</strong> targets medical students and residents committing to primary care service before completing training. The program helps lock in workforce commitments early, addressing the leakage that occurs when students change specialties or locations after graduation.</p>
<h3 id="scholarship-program">Scholarship Program<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#scholarship-program">#</a></h3>
<p>NHSC scholarships cover tuition, required fees, and provide monthly living stipends for students in primary care medicine, dentistry, physician assistant programs, nurse practitioner programs, and certified nurse midwifery. Recipients commit to service after graduation in <strong>HPSAs of greatest need</strong>, defined by minimum HPSA scores that vary by provider type.</p>
<p>For class year 2025, NHSC scholars must serve at sites with HPSA scores of 19 or above for primary care physicians and nurse practitioners, 5 or above for primary care physician assistants, and 16 or above for nurse midwives. These thresholds ensure scholarship recipients deploy to the most underserved areas rather than moderate shortage areas.</p>
<h3 id="funding-uncertainty">Funding Uncertainty<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#funding-uncertainty">#</a></h3>
<p>NHSC funding creates ongoing anxiety for program administrators and participants. The program now draws primarily from the <strong>Community Health Center Fund (CHCF)</strong>, a mandatory appropriation representing more than 70% of annual NHSC funding. But CHCF is time-limited, requiring periodic reauthorization.</p>
<p>The fund has been extended several times, most recently through September 2025. ARPA provided a one-time $800 million infusion in FY2021 that expanded awards but created a funding cliff as those obligations wound down. The FY2022 spike in NHSC field strength reflected ARPA funding; subsequent years saw reduced capacity as supplemental funding exhausted.</p>
<p><strong>For rural communities depending on NHSC providers, this funding uncertainty translates to workforce instability.</strong> Providers recruited through loan repayment may not be replaceable if program capacity contracts. RHTP workforce initiatives must account for this uncertainty when designing retention strategies that do not depend entirely on federal recruitment subsidies.</p>
<h3 id="provider-mix-evolution">Provider Mix Evolution<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#provider-mix-evolution">#</a></h3>
<p>NHSC composition has shifted dramatically over fifteen years. In FY2009, physicians represented nearly 35% of NHSC providers. By FY2016, physicians had fallen to 21% while behavioral and mental health providers had become the largest category at 30%. By FY2023, <strong>48% of NHSC providers were in behavioral health disciplines</strong>, reflecting both the SUD workforce programs and the broader mental health crisis.</p>
<p>This shift matters for rural communities. Traditional physician recruitment through NHSC has diminished even as behavioral health recruitment has expanded. Rural hospitals seeking primary care physicians cannot rely on NHSC the way they could a decade ago. Alternative recruitment strategies become necessary.</p>
<h2 id="community-health-center-program">Community Health Center Program<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#community-health-center-program">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="safety-net-foundation">Safety Net Foundation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#safety-net-foundation">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Community Health Centers (CHCs) serve 52 million Americans annually</strong>, approximately one in seven Americans and one in three in rural areas. These nonprofit, patient-governed organizations provide comprehensive primary care regardless of ability to pay. CHCs operate as the nation&rsquo;s largest primary care system, delivering care to 14% of the U.S. population for approximately 1% of total healthcare spending.</p>
<p>The approximately 1,400 active Health Center Program grantees operate through more than 17,000 service delivery sites. When including FQHC Look-Alikes (which meet requirements but do not receive Section 330 grants) and their service sites, the total network exceeds 19,000 locations. The CHC workforce has grown to 326,000 full-time employees.</p>
<h3 id="section-330-grants">Section 330 Grants<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#section-330-grants">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Health Center Program funding flows through Section 330 of the Public Health Service Act.</strong> Organizations receiving these grants become Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), gaining access to enhanced Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, malpractice coverage through the Federal Tort Claims Act, access to 340B drug pricing, and eligibility to serve as NHSC placement sites.</p>
<p>Grant mechanisms include:</p>
<p><strong>Base operational grants</strong> provide core funding for health center operations. These grants support the comprehensive services that health centers must provide regardless of patient volume or payer mix.</p>
<p><strong>Service Area Competition (SAC)</strong> awards fund health centers to serve designated geographic areas. SAC grants include protections against other federally-funded health centers entering established service areas.</p>
<p><strong>New Access Point (NAP) grants</strong> support the establishment of new health center sites or the expansion of existing health centers into new service areas. NAP funding targets unserved low-income populations and considers penetration levels, HPSA scores, and geographic distribution.</p>
<h3 id="rural-health-center-integration">Rural Health Center Integration<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#rural-health-center-integration">#</a></h3>
<p>In 2024, <strong>one in five rural residents were served by HRSA-funded health centers</strong>. Rural FQHCs function as critical safety net infrastructure in communities where other providers have departed or never existed.</p>
<p>Telehealth has become central to rural FQHC operations. According to the 2024 Community Health Center Chartbook, 92% of rural health centers offered mental health services via telehealth and 60% offered substance use disorder services via telehealth in 2022. Medicare permanently allows FQHCs reimbursement for mental health telehealth visits, including audio-only technology when video is not available.</p>
<p>FQHCs in rural areas face distinct financial pressures. Capital Link&rsquo;s 2025 analysis of FQHC financial and operational performance found rural health centers navigating payer mix challenges, staffing constraints, and infrastructure limitations that differ from urban counterparts. Medi-Cal accounts for 77% of net patient revenue at California&rsquo;s San Joaquin Valley community health centers, illustrating the Medicaid dependence that makes these organizations vulnerable to coverage contraction.</p>
<h3 id="rhtp-integration-opportunities">RHTP Integration Opportunities<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#rhtp-integration-opportunities">#</a></h3>
<p>RHTP transformation initiatives should leverage existing FQHC infrastructure rather than creating parallel systems. FQHCs already possess:</p>
<p><strong>Community relationships</strong> built over years of serving populations regardless of insurance status. Trust cannot be manufactured quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Sliding fee scale infrastructure</strong> enabling care for uninsured patients. This capacity becomes critical as Medicaid contraction increases the uninsured population.</p>
<p><strong>Behavioral health integration experience</strong> from years of expanding mental health and SUD services. Rural FQHCs have learned what works in resource-constrained environments.</p>
<p><strong>NHSC site approval</strong> enabling workforce recruitment through federal programs. New providers can be directed to existing FQHC platforms rather than requiring new site development.</p>
<p>States treating FQHCs as partners in transformation rather than competitors for funding will achieve better outcomes than states building redundant infrastructure.</p>
<h2 id="medicare-rural-hospital-flexibility-program">Medicare Rural Hospital Flexibility Program<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#medicare-rural-hospital-flexibility-program">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="program-purpose">Program Purpose<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#program-purpose">#</a></h3>
<p>The <strong>Medicare Rural Hospital Flexibility (Flex) Program</strong>, established by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, responded to the rural hospital closure crisis of the 1980s and 1990s. The program created the Critical Access Hospital (CAH) designation that allows small rural hospitals to receive cost-based Medicare reimbursement rather than prospective payment rates.</p>
<p>Flex serves 1,360 CAHs across the United States through state-administered grants. The overall goal is ensuring high-quality healthcare, including preventive, ambulatory, pre-hospital, emergent, and inpatient care, remains available in rural communities aligned with community needs.</p>
<h3 id="state-grant-structure">State Grant Structure<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#state-grant-structure">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>State Offices of Rural Health (SORHs) carry out the Flex Program.</strong> Federal grants flow to designated state entities that then provide technical assistance tailored to CAH needs within their states. The current funding cycle runs FY2024 through FY2028.</p>
<p>Required program components include:</p>
<p><strong>CAH Quality Improvement through MBQIP.</strong> The Medicare Beneficiary Quality Improvement Project seeks to improve care quality by increasing voluntary data reporting and driving improvement activities based on reported metrics. Nearly 100% of participating CAHs voluntarily report quality measures.</p>
<p><strong>CAH Financial and Operational Improvement.</strong> Technical assistance addresses revenue cycle, expense management, strategic planning, and operational efficiency. Over 40% of participants improved on financial measures after participating in improvement activities.</p>
<p>Additional Flex activities include CAH designation support for hospitals seeking conversion, population health initiatives, and rural emergency medical services integration.</p>
<h3 id="technical-assistance-networks">Technical Assistance Networks<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#technical-assistance-networks">#</a></h3>
<p>Flex creates infrastructure that RHTP can leverage. The <strong>National Rural Health Resource Center&rsquo;s Technical Assistance and Services Center</strong> provides information, tools, and education across all five Flex program areas. <strong>Stratis Health</strong> provides quality improvement technical assistance through FORHP-supported cooperative agreements.</p>
<p>State Flex programs have developed relationships with every CAH in their states. They understand local challenges, leadership capabilities, and improvement opportunities. RHTP initiatives that bypass this existing infrastructure waste time rebuilding knowledge that already exists.</p>
<p><strong>RHTP transformation requiring CAH participation should route through Flex programs.</strong> The technical assistance capacity, quality improvement frameworks, and established relationships represent sunk costs that transformation initiatives can leverage at no additional expense.</p>
<h2 id="state-offices-of-rural-health">State Offices of Rural Health<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#state-offices-of-rural-health">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="federal-state-partnership">Federal-State Partnership<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#federal-state-partnership">#</a></h3>
<p>Every state maintains a <strong>State Office of Rural Health (SORH)</strong>, typically funded through HRSA grants and state appropriations. These offices serve as information clearinghouses, technical assistance coordinators, and federal program liaisons for rural health stakeholders within their states.</p>
<p>SORH functions include:</p>
<p><strong>Information clearinghouse operations</strong> providing rural health data, program information, and resource directories to providers, communities, and policymakers within the state.</p>
<p><strong>Provider recruitment assistance</strong> helping rural communities identify, attract, and retain healthcare providers through recruitment strategies, incentive programs, and community support development.</p>
<p><strong>Program coordination</strong> connecting rural providers and communities with appropriate federal and state programs, including NHSC placement, Flex participation, and grant opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>Policy development support</strong> informing state policy decisions with rural health data, perspectives, and analysis.</p>
<h3 id="rhtp-implementation-role">RHTP Implementation Role<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#rhtp-implementation-role">#</a></h3>
<p>RHTP requires states to engage SORHs in application development and implementation planning. This consultation requirement recognizes that <strong>SORHs possess institutional knowledge that centralized state agencies lack.</strong> They know which communities face immediate crisis, which providers are considering departure, and which infrastructure investments would yield greatest impact.</p>
<p>States that treat SORH consultation as a checkbox exercise rather than substantive partnership will develop transformation plans disconnected from ground reality. States that integrate SORH expertise into planning and implementation will avoid the naive assumptions that waste transformation resources.</p>

<h3 id="training-pipeline-programs">Training Pipeline Programs<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#training-pipeline-programs">#</a></h3>
<p>The <strong>Rural Residency Planning and Development (RRPD) Program</strong> addresses the fundamental workforce challenge: most physicians practice within 100 miles of where they completed residency. Creating rural residency programs increases the probability that physicians will remain in rural practice.</p>
<p>HRSA anticipates 14 RRPD awards of up to $750,000 each in 2026 for developing new accredited rural residency programs or Rural Track Programs. Eligible specialties include family medicine, internal medicine, preventive medicine, psychiatry, general surgery, and obstetrics-gynecology.</p>
<p><strong>Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education</strong> provides federal funding for residency programs operated by FQHCs and other community-based ambulatory care settings. This program creates residency slots in safety net settings serving underserved populations, increasing the pipeline of physicians with training experience relevant to rural and underserved practice.</p>
<h3 id="rhtp-alignment">RHTP Alignment<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#rhtp-alignment">#</a></h3>
<p>RHTP explicitly authorizes workforce recruitment and retention expenditures with minimum five-year commitment requirements. States can use transformation funds to supplement federal residency support, creating stronger incentives for rural training program development.</p>
<p>The combination of RRPD startup grants and RHTP sustainability funding could enable residency programs that neither funding stream could support alone. This represents the coordination opportunity that federal program fragmentation usually prevents.</p>
<h2 id="hhs-restructuring-implications">HHS Restructuring Implications<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#hhs-restructuring-implications">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="administration-for-a-healthy-america">Administration for a Healthy America<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#administration-for-a-healthy-america">#</a></h3>
<p>On March 27, 2025, HHS announced a <strong>dramatic restructuring</strong> creating the Administration for a Healthy America (AHA). This new entity consolidates five existing HHS operating divisions: the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health (OASH), HRSA, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).</p>
<p>According to HHS, AHA will include divisions for Primary Care, Maternal and Child Health, Mental Health, Environmental Health, HIV/AIDS, and Workforce. The stated purpose is &ldquo;more efficiently coordinat[ing] chronic care and disease prevention programs and harmoniz[ing] health resources to low-income Americans.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="program-continuity-questions">Program Continuity Questions<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#program-continuity-questions">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>The restructuring raises significant questions for rural health programs.</strong> HRSA&rsquo;s Bureau of Health Workforce manages NHSC. HRSA&rsquo;s Bureau of Primary Health Care funds community health centers. FORHP administers Flex and rural grant programs. How these functions will operate within AHA divisions remains unclear.</p>
<p>The FY2026 budget request submitted after the restructuring announcement described AHA divisions and their proposed functions, but operational details remain uncertain. Congressional Research Service analysis notes that statutory authorization for various HRSA programs may constrain administrative restructuring, raising questions about legal authority for proposed changes.</p>
<p>On May 5, 2025, nineteen states and the District of Columbia filed suit challenging the reorganization. On July 1, 2025, a federal district court issued a preliminary injunction finding the reorganization likely violated the Administrative Procedure Act and blocking implementation of workforce reductions and restructuring.</p>
<h3 id="rural-health-stakes">Rural Health Stakes<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#rural-health-stakes">#</a></h3>
<p>The outcome matters for rural health transformation. <strong>If AHA restructuring fragments HRSA institutional knowledge or disrupts grant administration, states lose technical assistance capacity precisely when RHTP implementation requires support.</strong> If the restructuring improves coordination across previously siloed programs, rural communities could benefit from more integrated federal engagement.</p>
<p>States cannot control federal restructuring outcomes, but they can maintain relationships with program staff regardless of organizational chart changes. Individual expertise and established partnerships often persist through reorganization even when official structures shift.</p>

<h3 id="workforce-pipeline-assessments">Workforce Pipeline Assessments<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#workforce-pipeline-assessments">#</a></h3>
<p>The Association of American Medical Colleges projects the U.S. will face a shortage of <strong>54,100 to 139,000 physicians by 2033</strong>, including shortfalls in both primary and specialty care. Rural areas already experience these shortages; national projections represent future urban reality catching up to current rural conditions.</p>
<p>Research on NHSC effectiveness finds positive results. A 2021 study discovered that NHSC clinicians in community health centers increased medical and behavioral health care visits without increasing service costs. NHSC clinicians reduced behavioral health costs by $3.55 per visit in CHCs and $7.95 per visit in rural CHCs specifically.</p>
<h3 id="provider-association-perspectives">Provider Association Perspectives<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#provider-association-perspectives">#</a></h3>
<p>The National Association of Community Health Centers advocates for stable CHCF reauthorization and NHSC expansion. The National Rural Health Association emphasizes Flex program importance for CAH sustainability. State associations of rural health clinics and hospitals lobby for payment adequacy alongside workforce programs.</p>
<p>These perspectives reflect <strong>institutional dependence on federal programs</strong> that have become essential infrastructure. Rural health delivery in 2026 cannot be disentangled from the federal programs that built it. RHTP transformation operates within this context, not outside it.</p>
<h2 id="politics-and-policy">Politics and Policy<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#politics-and-policy">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="community-health-center-fund-reauthorization">Community Health Center Fund Reauthorization<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#community-health-center-fund-reauthorization">#</a></h3>
<p>The time-limited nature of mandatory NHSC and health center funding creates recurring political uncertainty. Reauthorization cycles become opportunities for policy changes that program administrators and beneficiaries cannot predict. The September 2025 CHCF extension represents the latest in a series of short-term fixes that prevent long-term planning.</p>
<p><strong>Stable authorization would benefit rural health workforce planning.</strong> Providers considering loan repayment commitments face uncertainty about whether programs will continue for their full service period. Communities investing in NHSC recruitment cannot know whether replacement providers will be available when current participants complete obligations.</p>
<h3 id="hhs-reorganization-implementation">HHS Reorganization Implementation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#hhs-reorganization-implementation">#</a></h3>
<p>Legal challenges to HHS restructuring remain active. The July 2025 preliminary injunction blocks implementation but may be overturned on appeal or through compliance with procedural requirements. Congress continues oversight hearings examining reorganization authority and program impacts.</p>
<p>States depending on HRSA technical assistance should monitor litigation outcomes. <strong>Program disruption remains possible</strong> even if current injunctions hold, as administrative capacity may have been reduced before courts intervened.</p>
<h3 id="rhtp-hrsa-coordination">RHTP-HRSA Coordination<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#rhtp-hrsa-coordination">#</a></h3>
<p>RHTP statute requires coordination with existing federal programs. CMS administers RHTP while HRSA (or AHA) administers workforce and safety net programs. Interagency coordination historically challenges federal health policy. Whether transformation funds and workforce programs will operate in concert or parallel depends on implementation decisions not yet finalized.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>HRSA programs represent <strong>decades of infrastructure investment</strong> that RHTP transformation cannot replicate in five years. The National Health Service Corps has placed providers in shortage areas since 1970. Community Health Centers have served millions regardless of ability to pay since the 1960s. Flex has supported Critical Access Hospitals since 1997. State Offices of Rural Health have coordinated federal-state rural health activities for decades.</p>
<p>RHTP builds on this foundation. States that leverage existing NHSC sites, FQHC networks, Flex technical assistance, and SORH expertise will accomplish more with transformation funds than states attempting to build from scratch.</p>
<p>The HHS restructuring introduces uncertainty at an inopportune moment. RHTP implementation requires federal technical assistance that administrative disruption could impair. States should maintain relationships with program staff, track reorganization developments, and plan for scenarios where federal support proves less available than expected.</p>
<p><strong>HRSA programs will continue regardless of RHTP.</strong> They will continue after RHTP sunsets in 2030. Understanding these programs as permanent infrastructure rather than temporary initiatives clarifies the appropriate relationship: RHTP should strengthen systems that will persist, not create parallel structures that will disappear when transformation funding ends.</p>
