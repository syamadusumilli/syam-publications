  "articleBody": "This technical document provides a comprehensive reference for federal rural health programs operating alongside the Rural Health Transformation Program (RHTP). The matrix enables state planners, providers, and analysts to identify program overlaps, coordinate funding streams, and understand the federal landscape that RHTP transformation must navigate.\nRHTP does not operate in isolation. CMS, HRSA, IHS, and USDA collectively administer billions in rural health funding through programs with distinct eligibility criteria, funding mechanisms, and reporting requirements. Effective transformation requires understanding these relationships rather than treating RHTP as standalone investment.\nPart I: Program Inventory CMS Programs Program Annual Funding Primary Function Eligible Entities Rural Health Transformation Program $10 billion Transformation grants States (pass-through to providers) Critical Access Hospital (CAH) Cost-based reimbursement 101% Medicare cost payment Rural hospitals meeting criteria Rural Emergency Hospital (REH) $285,626/month + 105% OPPS Converted hospital support Former CAHs/rural hospitals Sole Community Hospital (SCH) Enhanced PPS rates Geographic isolation payment Isolated rural hospitals Medicare Dependent Hospital (MDH) Enhanced PPS rates Medicare-heavy facility support Rural hospitals, 100 beds max Rural Health Clinic (RHC) $152 AIR limit (2025) Primary care reimbursement Certified rural clinics HRSA Programs Program Annual Funding Primary Function Eligible Entities National Health Service Corps ~$900 million Workforce loan repayment/scholarships Clinicians in HPSAs Community Health Center Program ~$6 billion Safety net primary care FQHCs and Look-Alikes Medicare Rural Hospital Flexibility (Flex) ~$55 million CAH technical assistance State agencies (for CAHs) State Offices of Rural Health ~$12 million Coordination and TA State rural health offices Rural Residency Planning \u0026 Development ~$10 million Training pipeline Academic medical centers Rural Health Network Development ~$8 million Network planning/implementation Rural health networks Small Rural Hospital Improvement (SHIP) ~$18 million Small hospital support Rural hospitals under 50 beds IHS Programs Program Annual Funding Primary Function Eligible Entities IHS Direct Services ~$5 billion Direct healthcare delivery IHS facilities Tribal Self-Determination (638) Included in IHS Tribal-operated programs Federally recognized tribes Urban Indian Health ~$90 million Urban Native American care Urban Indian Organizations Special Diabetes Program for Indians $159 million Chronic disease prevention IHS, tribal, and urban programs Behavioral Health Programs ~$80 million (proposed) Mental health and SUD IHS, tribal, and urban programs USDA Programs Program Annual Funding Primary Function Eligible Entities Distance Learning and Telemedicine ~$40 million Telehealth equipment grants Rural providers, tribes, governments Community Facilities Direct Loans $2.8 billion (loan authority) Healthcare facility construction Rural communities under 20,000 Community Facilities Grants ~$5 million + earmarks Healthcare facility grants Rural communities, priority to smallest ReConnect Program $500 million to $1+ billion Broadband infrastructure Rural areas without service Rural Health and Safety Education ~$4 million Community

Permitted Combinations:\nCAH status + RHTP funding: CAHs can receive RHTP transformation dollars while maintaining cost-based reimbursement NHSC placement + RHTP workforce: NHSC clinicians can work at RHTP-funded sites; RHTP cannot duplicate loan repayment FQHC + RHTP: FQHCs can participate in state transformation networks while receiving Section 330 funding DLT equipment + RHTP telehealth: USDA can fund equipment while RHTP funds operations/staffing Prohibited Combinations:\nRHTP backfill: RHTP cannot replace existing revenue streams (Medicaid, Medicare, private pay) Duplicate loan repayment: State RHTP loan repayment cannot stack with federal NHSC for same debt Double capital funding: Same construction project cannot receive both RHTP capital and Community Facilities loan for identical costs Coordination Requirements:\nStates must document non-duplication in RHTP budget narratives NHSC site approval requires demonstration of sustainable funding post-award FQHCs receiving RHTP must maintain Section 330 compliance Part IV: Timeline Alignment Application Cycles Program Application Window Award Announcement Performance Period RHTP September 2025 (initial) December 2025 5

<p>This technical document provides a <strong>comprehensive reference for federal rural health programs</strong> operating alongside the Rural Health Transformation Program (RHTP). The matrix enables state planners, providers, and analysts to identify program overlaps, coordinate funding streams, and understand the federal landscape that RHTP transformation must navigate.</p>
<p><strong>RHTP does not operate in isolation.</strong> CMS, HRSA, IHS, and USDA collectively administer billions in rural health funding through programs with distinct eligibility criteria, funding mechanisms, and reporting requirements. Effective transformation requires understanding these relationships rather than treating RHTP as standalone investment.</p>
