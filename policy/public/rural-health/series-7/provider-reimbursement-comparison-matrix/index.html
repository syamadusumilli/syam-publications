  "articleBody": "Technical Document B Rural Health Transformation Project\nPurpose and Analytical Value This technical document compiles payment methodologies and rates affecting rural healthcare providers across payer types and provider categories. The matrix serves Series 7 articles by revealing how reimbursement environments shape provider financial capacity and, consequently, transformation potential.\nKey insight: Payment policy creates different transformation environments across states and provider types. Providers operating under identical RHTP transformation expectations face radically different financial realities depending on their payer mix, state Medicaid policies, and provider designation. A CAH in Montana receiving cost-based Medicaid reimbursement operates in a fundamentally different environment than a CAH in Texas receiving Medicaid rates that cover 60% of costs.\nThis document enables analysis of why similarly structured providers in similar communities achieve different outcomes. The answer often lies in payment policy variation invisible to observers focused on program design.\nSection 1: Medicare Rates by Provider Type Hospital Providers Provider Type Payment Basis CY 2026 Rate Summary Rural Adjustments Key Limitations Critical Access Hospital Cost-based 101% of allowable costs None beyond cost-based structure 2% sequestration reduces effective rate to ~99%; not all costs allowable; coinsurance based on charges creates patient burden Rural Emergency Hospital OPPS + facility fee 105% of OPPS rate + $293,107/month facility payment (CY 2026 est.) 5% service premium; fixed monthly facility payment No inpatient services; must maintain 24/7 ED; limited to 42 facilities nationally as of October 2025 Sole Community Hospital IPPS with floor Hospital-specific rate floor based on 1982, 1987, 1996, or 2006 base year Rate cannot fall below historical base Must be sole hospital in area; 100+ bed limitation for some benefits Medicare Dependent Hospital IPPS with adjustment 75% of difference between IPPS and hospital-specific rate Available only to hospitals with 60%+ Medicare payer mix Limited to rural hospitals under 100 beds; phases out periodically PPS Hospital (Rural) DRG-based Wage index and rural add-on adjustments Low-volume adjustment; rural floor; geographic reclassification options Volume thresholds can disqualify small hospitals from add-ons Primary Care and Clinic Providers Provider Type Payment Basis CY 2026 Rate Summary Key Features Limitations Rural Health Clinic All-inclusive rate (AIR) $165 per visit payment limit for independent and large hospital PBRHCs Cost-based with statutory cap; grandfathered PBRHCs may exceed cap Cap limits reimbursement for clinics with costs above $165; telehealth flexibilities expire January 31, 2026 without legislation FQHC Prospective payment $207.72 base rate (CY 2026); +34.16% for new patients/AWV/IPPE Geographic adjustment factor applies; separate care management billing at PFS rates Per-encounter payment regardless of visit complexity Provider-Based RHC (Grandfathered) Cost-based Greater of: CY 2025 rate + 2.7% MEI OR $165 national limit Applies to PBRHCs in hospitals under 50 beds enrolled before December 31, 2020 Must maintain qualifying status; associated hospital bed count determines eligibility Emergency Medical Services Service Level Payment Basis CY 2026 Rate Summary Rural Adjustments Notes BLS Ground (A0428) Fee schedule ~$290 base (varies by locality) +3% rural; +22.6% super-rural bonus Locality GPCI adjustments apply ALS Level 1 (A0426) Fee schedule ~$435 base (varies by locality) +3% rural; +22.6% super-rural bonus Higher RVU than BLS ALS Level 2 (A0433) Fee schedule ~$630 base (varies by locality) +3% rural; +22.6% super-rural bonus Highest ground ambulance RVU Ground Mileage (Rural) Per mile ~$8.50 per mile (miles 1-17); ~$5.50 per mile (miles 18+) 1.5x urban mileage rate for rural Loaded miles only; no payment for response Rural Add-Ons Temporary +2% urban; +3% rural Extended through January 30, 2026 Expire January 31, 2026 without legislation Critical EMS payment gap: Medicare pays only for “loaded miles” (patient on board). No payment for response to scene or return after transport. Rural EMS with long response distances loses money on every Medicare transport regardless of payment rates.\nLong-Term Care Service Type Payment Basis CY 2026 Rate Summary Notes SNF (PPS) Per diem case-mix National average ~$600/day; varies by case-mix group Rural adjustment factor applies CAH Swing Bed Cost-based 101% of allowable costs OIG recommends alignment with SNF PPS (~$350/day); CMS has not concurred Home Health LUPA/30-day periods ~$2,000 per 30-day period (average) Geographic and case-mix adjustments Behavioral Health Service Type Payment Basis CY 2026 Rate Summary Notes IPF (Inpatient Psychiatric) Per diem PPS ~$880 base rate; 2.5% update for CY 2026 Teaching and rural adjustment factors increasing in FY 2026 FQHC/RHC Mental Health Same as medical visit $207.72 FQHC / $165 RHC Audio-only permanently allowed; in-person requirement delayed to January 31, 2026 CMHC Partial hospitalization OPPS rates for PHP services Often below actual costs IOP (RHC/FQHC) Per-day rate 3 services: $319.38; 4+ services: $418.45 New benefit effective 2024 Section 2: Medicaid Payment Variation Medicaid reimbursement varies dramatically across states, creating fundamentally different operating environments for providers serving identical patient populations. The following analysis presents state-level variation for key provider types.\nState Medicaid-to-Medicare Fee Index The Medicaid-to-Medicare Fee Index measures state Medicaid physician fees as a percentage of Medicare rates. Rural providers serving high-Medicaid populations in low-fee states face structural deficits no transformation strategy can overcome.\nState Category Medicaid-to-Medicare Ratio Example States Transformation Implication High (\u003e90%) 90-120% of Medicare Alaska, Montana, North Dakota, Wyoming Medicaid revenue approaches adequacy; transformation investment possible Moderate (70-90%) 70-89% of Medicare Colorado, Minnesota, Washington, Oregon Medicaid losses manageable with Medicare cross-subsidy Low (50-70%) 50-69% of Medicare Texas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana Significant Medicaid losses; transformation capacity constrained Very Low (\u003c50%) Below 50% of Medicare Some service categories in multiple states Medicaid services generate substantial losses; providers avoid Medicaid patients Data limitation: KFF Medicaid-to-Medicare Fee Index captures physician services only. Hospital and facility payment variation is more complex and less consistently reported.\nState Medicaid Hospital Payment Approaches Approach States Using Mechanism Impact on Rural Hospitals Cost-based reimbursement for CAHs ~15 states Medicaid pays cost-based (like Medicare) for CAHs Protects CAHs from Medicaid losses DRG-based with rural add-on ~20 states Prospective payment with rural adjustment Adjustment rarely covers rural cost premium Fee schedule ~10 states Fixed rates regardless of provider type Often significantly below cost Managed care rates Varies MCO negotiates with providers Rates often at or below FFS; supplemental payments may apply State-Directed Payments in Managed Care 37 of 41 MCO states reported state-directed payments (SDPs) for hospital services as of July 2024. SDPs supplement base MCO payments to approach Medicare or commercial rates.\nSDP Structure States Mechanism Rural Impact Average Commercial Rate (ACR) Emerging (5+ states pursuing) Supplemental payment to reach commercial rate average Significant increase where implemented; requires state match Medicare Parity ~20 states Supplemental payment to reach Medicare FFS equivalent Helps but does not cover full costs for many rural providers DSH-style distribution ~15 states Directed payments based on uncompensated care burden Benefits high-uncompensated-care providers RHC and FQHC Medicaid Payment Federal law requires states to pay FQHCs and RHCs using a Prospective Payment System (PPS) methodology at rates no lower than their facility-specific historical costs, updated annually.\nState Approach Description Example States PPS with APM option Standard PPS with alternative payment methodology available North Carolina (implemented 2024), California PPS cost-settled Interim payments with cost report settlement Missouri, many others Managed care wrap MCO pays negotiated rate; state pays difference to PPS Most MCO states Key limitation: FQHC/RHC PPS rates are facility-specific based on historical costs. New clinics or expanding clinics may face rates below current costs until cost reports establish new baselines.\nSection 3: Commercial Payer Benchmarks Commercial insurance payment rates establish the ceiling against which Medicare and Medicaid rates compare. Rural providers typically lack negotiating leverage to achieve urban commercial rates.\nCommercial-to-Medicare Ratios by Service Type Service Category National Average Commercial Rate (% of Medicare) Rural Rate (% of Medicare) Gap Inpatient Hospital 224% 150-180% Rural hospitals receive 25-35% less than urban Outpatient Hospital 254% 160-200% Similar urban-rural gap Professional Services 129% 110-125% Smaller but still significant gap Source: Milliman Commercial Reimbursement Benchmarking 2025\nRural Commercial Payment Challenges Negotiating leverage: Rural providers often have limited commercial volume and face dominant regional insurers. Single-hospital markets should theoretically have leverage, but commercial payers can direct patients to urban facilities for elective care.\nNetwork adequacy: State network adequacy requirements may require plans to include rural providers, but adequacy standards rarely specify reimbursement floors.\nSelf-funded employers: ERISA-exempt employer plans negotiate directly with providers and may pay below commercial benchmarks.\nSection 4: Payment-Transformation Relationship Analysis The Revenue Adequacy Threshold Transformation capacity requires revenue adequacy: sufficient reimbursement to cover operating costs plus margin for investment. Providers below the adequacy threshold consume all resources on survival; none remain for transformation.\nPayer Mix Scenario Typical Margin Transformation Capacity Notes High Medicare (\u003e60%) 0-3% for CAHs; negative for PPS Low to moderate Cost-based CAH protection helps; volume decline still threatens High Medicaid (\u003e40%) Negative 2-8% Very low Medicaid losses overwhelm; state payment policy determines viability Balanced Mix 1-4% Moderate Cross-subsidy potential; commercial volume critical High Commercial (\u003e30%) 3-8% Moderate to high Only achievable in markets with commercial employment base High Uninsured (\u003e15%) Negative 5-15% None Bad debt/charity care overwhelms any positive margins State Payment Environment and Provider Outcomes States where rural providers report positive operating margins tend to share characteristics:\nMedicaid expansion reducing uninsured population Cost-based Medicaid payment for CAHs or RHCs Robust supplemental payment programs addressing Medicaid-Medicare gaps State appropriations for rural health infrastructure Commercial rate leverage from network adequacy requirements States where rural providers struggle despite RHTP investment:\nNon-expansion states with high uninsured rates Low Medicaid payment rates creating structural deficits Limited supplemental payment programs High Medicare Advantage penetration with rates below traditional Medicare Declining commercial population as young workers leave rural areas Medicare Advantage Impact on Rural Providers Medicare Advantage penetration creates additional payment variation. MA plans negotiate rates that often fall 10-15% below traditional Medicare FFS for rural providers.\nMA Penetration Level Traditional Medicare Share Impact on CAHs Low (\u003c20%) 80%+ Cost-based protection largely intact Moderate (20-40%) 60-80% Mixed; growing MA share erodes cost-based benefit High (\u003e40%) \u003c60% Significant revenue loss; CAH advantage diminished Critical point: CAH cost-based reimbursement applies only to traditional Medicare. As MA enrollment grows (now exceeding 50% of Medicare beneficiaries nationally), the CAH payment protection weakens proportionally.\nSection 5: Provider-Specific Payment Implications Critical Access Hospitals Optimal payment environment:\nTraditional Medicare dominant (\u003e70% of Medicare patients) State Medicaid cost-based reimbursement Commercial rates at or above Medicare Low uninsured population Challenging payment environment:\nHigh MA penetration eroding cost-based protection State Medicaid paying 60-70% of costs Limited commercial volume High uninsured/self-pay population Rural Health Clinics Optimal payment environment:\nCosts below $165 AIR cap (or grandfathered PBRHC status) State Medicaid PPS above costs Commercial contracts at Medicare parity or above Challenging payment environment:\nCosts significantly above AIR cap State Medicaid PPS below actual costs Heavy Medicaid caseload with wrap payment delays FQHCs Optimal payment environment:\nEstablished PPS rate reflecting actual costs State Medicaid wrap payments timely 330 grant funding supplementing patient revenue Diverse payer mix reducing single-payer dependence Challenging payment environment:\nNew or expanding clinic with below-cost PPS rate State managed care with poor FQHC rate negotiation Heavy uninsured population despite sliding fee scale 330 grant insufficient to cover uncompensated care Emergency Medical Services Payment environment is uniformly challenging:\nMedicare pays only loaded miles Medicaid rates often 50-70% of Medicare Commercial rates inconsistent High uninsured transport volume No sustainable EMS payment model exists in most rural areas without subsidy. Payment reform cannot solve fundamental gap between fee-schedule reimbursement and cost of maintaining 24/7 response capacity in low-volume areas.\nSection 6: Payment Policy Implications for RHTP What RHTP Cannot Change RHTP funding does not alter underlying payment policy. Transformation investments occur on top of existing payment environments. States and providers face identical Medicare fee schedules and state-determined Medicaid rates whether or not RHTP exists.\nImplication: RHTP transformation strategies must account for payment environment variation. A transformation approach viable in Montana (cost-based Medicaid, high traditional Medicare) may be impossible in Texas (low Medicaid rates, non-expansion, high MA penetration).\nWhat RHTP Could Influence RHTP investments could address payment environment challenges by:\nSupporting cost-based Medicaid payment advocacy at state level Funding EMS subsidy models that acknowledge payment gap Enabling value-based payment pilots with shared savings potential Building network arrangements that improve commercial negotiating leverage Supporting managed care contract negotiation for rural provider coalitions Payment Reform Priorities by Provider Type Provider Type Highest-Impact Payment Reform Political Feasibility RHTP Role CAH MA payment parity with traditional Medicare Low (requires legislation) Advocacy support REH Facility payment adjustment for inflation Moderate Demonstration data RHC AIR cap elimination or significant increase Moderate Cost documentation FQHC Complexity adjustment in PPS Moderate Quality/outcome data EMS Response/standby payment model Low in current environment Pilot funding Rural Hospital DSH/uncompensated care methodology reform Low to moderate State supplemental payment advocacy Appendix A: Rate Tables Reference Medicare RHC Payment Limits by Year Calendar Year National Payment Limit Percentage Increase 2021 (April+) $100 Baseline 2022 $113 13.0% 2023 $126 11.5% 2024 $139 10.3% 2025 $152 9.4% 2026 $165 8.6% 2027 $178 7.9% 2028+ $190 + MEI MEI annual Medicare FQHC PPS Base Rate by Year Calendar Year Base Rate Market Basket Increase 2023 $189.51 2.7% 2024 $195.99 3.4% 2025 $202.65 3.4% 2026 $207.72 2.5% Rural Ambulance Add-On Expiration Schedule Add-On Type Current Status Expiration Urban bonus (2%) Active January 31, 2026 Rural bonus (3%) Active January 31, 2026 Super-rural bonus (22.6%) Active Permanent in statute Sources American Hospital Association. “CMS Increases Medicare Hospital Outpatient Department Payment Rates by 2.6% in CY 2026.” AHA News, November 21, 2025.\nAmerican Ambulance Association. “2025 Medicare Rate Calculator.” January 2025.\nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services. “Calendar Year 2026 Update to Rural Health Clinic All Inclusive Rate Payment Limit.” MLN Matters MM14303, December 2025.\nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services. “CY 2026 Payment Rate Update to the FQHC PPS.” R13506BP, December 2025.\nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services. “Information for Critical Access Hospitals.” MLN006400, December 2025.\nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services. “Medicare Learning Network: Rural Emergency Hospitals.” MLN2259384, December 2025.\nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services. “Ambulance Fee Schedule Public Use Files.” CY 2026.\nDepartment of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General. “Medicare Could Save Billions with Comparable Access for Enrollees if Critical Access Hospital Payments for Swing-Bed Services Were Similar to Those of the Fee-for-Service Prospective Payment System.” January 2025.\nKFF. “Medicaid Budget Survey 2024-2025: Provider Rates and Taxes.” September 2025.\nKFF. “Medicaid-to-Medicare Fee Index.” State Health Facts, August 2025.\nMedicare Payment Advisory Commission. “Evaluating the Effects of Medicaid Payment Changes on Access to Physician Services.” January 2025.\nMilliman. “Commercial Reimbursement Benchmarking 2025: Commercial Payment Rates as a Percentage of Medicare Fee-for-Service Rates.” 2025.\nNational Association of Community Health Centers. “FQHC Payment Guide.” July 2025.\nNational Association of Rural Health Clinics. “Rural Health Clinics Secure Major Regulatory Wins in Medicare Physician Fee Schedule Final Rule.” November 2024.\nRural Health Information Hub. “Critical Access Hospitals Overview.” January 2026.\nRural Health Information Hub. “Rural Emergency Hospitals Overview.” October 2025.\nRural Health Information Hub. “Rural Health Clinics Overview.” 2025.\nSeries 7: Healthcare Providers Technical Document B: Provider Reimbursement Comparison Matrix Version 1: January 2026\n",

<h2 id="purpose-and-analytical-value">Purpose and Analytical Value<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#purpose-and-analytical-value">#</a></h2>
<p>This technical document compiles <strong>payment methodologies and rates affecting rural healthcare providers</strong> across payer types and provider categories. The matrix serves Series 7 articles by revealing how reimbursement environments shape provider financial capacity and, consequently, transformation potential.</p>
<p><strong>Key insight:</strong> Payment policy creates different transformation environments across states and provider types. Providers operating under identical RHTP transformation expectations face radically different financial realities depending on their payer mix, state Medicaid policies, and provider designation. <strong>A CAH in Montana receiving cost-based Medicaid reimbursement operates in a fundamentally different environment than a CAH in Texas receiving Medicaid rates that cover 60% of costs.</strong></p>
<p>This document enables analysis of why similarly structured providers in similar communities achieve different outcomes. The answer often lies in payment policy variation invisible to observers focused on program design.</p>

<p><strong>Negotiating leverage:</strong> Rural providers often have limited commercial volume and face dominant regional insurers. Single-hospital markets should theoretically have leverage, but commercial payers can direct patients to urban facilities for elective care.</p>
<p><strong>Network adequacy:</strong> State network adequacy requirements may require plans to include rural providers, but adequacy standards rarely specify reimbursement floors.</p>
<p><strong>Self-funded employers:</strong> ERISA-exempt employer plans negotiate directly with providers and may pay below commercial benchmarks.</p>

<p><strong>Implication:</strong> RHTP transformation strategies must account for payment environment variation. A transformation approach viable in Montana (cost-based Medicaid, high traditional Medicare) may be impossible in Texas (low Medicaid rates, non-expansion, high MA penetration).</p>

<p>RHTP investments could address payment environment challenges by:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Supporting cost-based Medicaid payment advocacy</strong> at state level</li>
<li><strong>Funding EMS subsidy models</strong> that acknowledge payment gap</li>
<li><strong>Enabling value-based payment pilots</strong> with shared savings potential</li>
<li><strong>Building network arrangements</strong> that improve commercial negotiating leverage</li>
<li><strong>Supporting managed care contract negotiation</strong> for rural provider coalitions</li>
