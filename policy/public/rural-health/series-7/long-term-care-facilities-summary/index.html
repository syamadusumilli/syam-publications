  "articleBody": "The collapse of rural long-term care follows predictable mechanics: facilities cannot hire enough workers, cannot pay competitive wages from Medicaid reimbursement covering 82-86% of costs, cannot maintain quality with insufficient staffing, and cannot survive the resulting financial losses. Since February 2020, at least 774 nursing homes have closed nationally, with rural communities absorbing 85% of county-level losses. Forty additional counties became nursing home deserts where no skilled nursing facility exists. The closure rate exceeds new openings by a factor of twenty.\nThe core dynamic operates as a self-reinforcing spiral. Staffing levels correlate directly with quality outcomes. Facilities that cannot staff adequately produce poor quality metrics. Poor metrics generate regulatory problems and low star ratings. Low ratings reduce referrals and census. Reduced census creates financial losses. Financial losses constrain wages and working conditions. Constrained wages worsen recruitment. The cycle feeds itself without external intervention to break it.\nRural nursing homes face systematic disadvantages that urban facilities avoid. They operate 60-70 beds versus 100-120 in urban settings, spreading fixed costs over fewer residents. They maintain 70-75% occupancy versus 80-85% urban rates, widening revenue gaps. They serve payer mixes weighted 60-70% toward Medicaid compared to more balanced urban distributions. Each disadvantage compounds the others. A facility receiving 65% of revenue from Medicaid at 86% of cost, 25% from Medicare at 110% of cost, and 10% from private pay at 120% of cost generates roughly 95% of costs covered, an unsustainable negative margin.\nThe workforce exodus that predated the pandemic accelerated dramatically during it. Nationally, 410,000 workers left nursing homes and long-term care facilities between February 2020 and November 2021. Staffing has recovered only partially, with roughly 103,000 positions refilled. Sixty-six percent of nursing homes report concern that persistent workforce challenges may force closure. Forty-six percent currently limit new admissions due to staffing constraints. Fifty-seven percent maintain waiting lists. Twenty percent have closed units, wings, or floors despite licensed capacity.\nThe staffing crisis reflects both genuine labor scarcity and job quality failure. Rural areas possess shrinking working-age populations while elderly populations grow. The ratio of working-age adults to elderly residents declines annually. Young people leave for metropolitan employment opportunities. Even substantially higher wages cannot hire workers who do not exist in the community. However, annual turnover exceeding 50% indicates workers leaving, not worker scarcity. Workers exist but choose other employment because nursing homes offer low pay, inadequate benefits, understaffing, and exhausting conditions compared to alternatives.\nThe Good Samaritan Society pattern illustrates the dynamics at scale. This Sioux Falls-based organization, the largest nonprofit provider of skilled nursing beds nationally, has closed 13 nursing homes in the past three years, predominantly in rural areas. In 2023, the organization announced plans to exit 15 states entirely, consolidating operations to seven Midwestern states where sufficient density enables viable operations. Facilities in communities like Bloomfield, Nebraska (population 1,000) or Miller, South Dakota (population 1,300) simply cannot recruit the workforce required for sustainable operations. The Syracuse, Nebraska facility operates at barely half its licensed capacity because managers cannot find enough staff to care for more residents despite paying certified nursing assistants $21 per hour and registered nurses $40 per hour.\nThe staffing mandate controversy revealed fundamental tensions between quality goals and capacity constraints. The 2024 Biden administration rule would have required 3.48 hours per resident day of total nursing staff, including 0.55 hours from registered nurses and 2.45 hours from nurse aides. Analysis found only 6% of facilities met all requirements. Rural facilities faced particular challenges: 92% would have needed to hire more RNs to comply with 24/7 RN requirements. The Trump administration rescinded these requirements in December 2025, citing rural and tribal community impacts. Advocates argued the rule would have saved 13,000 lives annually. Industry argued it would have accelerated closures. Both claims contain truth: adequate staffing improves quality, but mandating staffing without funding staffing closes facilities rather than improving them.\nThe Syracuse dilemma captures the impossible choice. Lana Obermeyer visits her mother Sharon at the Good Samaritan facility every week. Sharon has advanced Alzheimer’s disease. The facility operates at half capacity for lack of staff. The memory care unit where Sharon should receive specialized dementia care closed years ago. If Syracuse closed, Sharon would transfer to Lincoln or Omaha, an hour’s drive each way. Weekly visits would become monthly. Sharon would spend her final years among strangers. Federal staffing mandates intended to improve care would eliminate care entirely for communities like Syracuse. Is it better to have a nursing home that struggles to hire workers, or no nursing home at all? Syracuse has no good answer. Neither does federal policy.\nRHTP addresses rural long-term care tangentially rather than directly. Federal funding targets transformation of healthcare delivery systems, with nursing homes appearing primarily as post-acute partners or aging-in-place barriers rather than transformation subjects themselves. Yet the nursing home crisis directly affects RHTP goals in measurable ways. Hospitals cannot discharge patients when nursing homes have no beds. A 2025 University of Rochester study found that reduced nursing home capacity linked directly to longer hospital stays, especially extended stays of 28 days or more. Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester routinely has 50-75 admitted patients waiting in overflow spaces for inpatient rooms, partly because nursing home bed shortages prevent discharge. For RHTP-funded hospitals pursuing efficiency and transformation, nursing home capacity constraints create direct obstacles. Hospitals cannot redesign patient flow when downstream capacity does not exist.\nAging-in-place initiatives face parallel limitations. RHTP prioritizes home and community-based care that allows people to age in place rather than entering institutional settings, aligning with the 62.5% of rural respondents to the National Health and Aging Trends Study who prefer to receive care in their own home. But aging in place has limits. When care needs exceed what home and community services can provide, institutional care becomes necessary. Cognitive decline severe enough to require 24-hour supervision, medical complexity requiring continuous skilled nursing, or family caregiver exhaustion beyond respite services can all necessitate nursing home placement. If nursing home capacity contracts while aging populations grow, the gap creates impossible situations where individuals who need institutional care cannot access it.\nRHTP workforce investments target healthcare workers broadly through loan repayment programs, training pipelines, and recruitment initiatives seeking to increase rural healthcare workforce supply. Nursing homes compete for these same workers, but the competition is unequal. Hospital positions typically offer better wages, more predictable schedules, and higher prestige than nursing home positions. Nursing degrees can lead to hospital employment or nursing home employment; graduates typically prefer hospitals. RHTP workforce investments may increase healthcare worker supply overall while doing little for nursing home staffing specifically. State RHTP strategies that fund nursing education without addressing nursing home working conditions may inadvertently worsen nursing home recruitment.\nThe provider-as-victim narrative contains substantial truth that policy analysis cannot ignore. Medicaid rates are set by government, not providers. Facilities cannot unilaterally raise rates. When government pays 86 cents per dollar of cost, the resulting losses are government-imposed, not provider-chosen. Demanding better quality from underfunded providers represents policy incoherence. The staffing mandate represented an unfunded mandate: requiring facilities to hire workers without providing funding to pay workers shifts costs while claiming to improve quality. COVID was not providers’ fault, yet the pandemic killed nursing home residents at catastrophic rates, traumatized staff, and imposed massive costs for infection control. Demographic change producing older rural populations and younger population outmigration is structural, not something nursing homes caused or can reverse.\nHowever, the narrative is incomplete. For-profit nursing homes extract profits that could fund wages. Related-party transactions transfer revenue to ownership entities. The claim that reimbursement prevents adequate wages sometimes obscures choices about profit extraction. Some facilities in identical reimbursement environments perform better than others. Leadership, management, culture, and community relationships explain variation that reimbursement alone cannot. Many closed facilities had quality problems before financial problems: four of the 17 Iowa facilities that closed in 2022 were in CMS’s special focus program or candidates for it, facing extra scrutiny for poor performance. Context constrains options; it does not eliminate agency.\nTransformation capacity exists unevenly across rural long-term care. Regional scale creates recruitment advantages that standalone facilities cannot match. Facilities operated by regional organizations with multiple locations can offer career advancement, training programs, and transfer opportunities. State Medicaid adequacy enables sustainability: states that have increased Medicaid nursing facility rates substantially, like Wyoming (20% increase in 2023) or Montana (33% increase over two years), give facilities financial capacity for competitive wages. Community engagement sustains facilities in ways that isolated operations cannot achieve. Workforce pipeline investment through CNA\n",

<div class="post-content">
<p>The collapse of rural long-term care follows predictable mechanics: facilities cannot hire enough workers, cannot pay competitive wages from Medicaid reimbursement covering 82-86% of costs, cannot maintain quality with insufficient staffing, and cannot survive the resulting financial losses. Since February 2020, at least 774 nursing homes have closed nationally, with rural communities absorbing 85% of county-level losses. Forty additional counties became nursing home deserts where no skilled nursing facility exists. The closure rate exceeds new openings by a factor of twenty.</p>
<p>The core dynamic operates as a self-reinforcing spiral. <strong>Staffing levels correlate directly with quality outcomes.</strong> Facilities that cannot staff adequately produce poor quality metrics. Poor metrics generate regulatory problems and low star ratings. Low ratings reduce referrals and census. Reduced census creates financial losses. Financial losses constrain wages and working conditions. Constrained wages worsen recruitment. The cycle feeds itself without external intervention to break it.</p>
<p>Rural nursing homes face systematic disadvantages that urban facilities avoid. They operate 60-70 beds versus 100-120 in urban settings, spreading fixed costs over fewer residents. They maintain 70-75% occupancy versus 80-85% urban rates, widening revenue gaps. They serve payer mixes weighted 60-70% toward Medicaid compared to more balanced urban distributions. Each disadvantage compounds the others. A facility receiving 65% of revenue from Medicaid at 86% of cost, 25% from Medicare at 110% of cost, and 10% from private pay at 120% of cost generates roughly 95% of costs covered, an unsustainable negative margin.</p>
<p>The workforce exodus that predated the pandemic accelerated dramatically during it. Nationally, 410,000 workers left nursing homes and long-term care facilities between February 2020 and November 2021. Staffing has recovered only partially, with roughly 103,000 positions refilled. Sixty-six percent of nursing homes report concern that persistent workforce challenges may force closure. Forty-six percent currently limit new admissions due to staffing constraints. Fifty-seven percent maintain waiting lists. Twenty percent have closed units, wings, or floors despite licensed capacity.</p>
<p><strong>The staffing crisis reflects both genuine labor scarcity and job quality failure.</strong> Rural areas possess shrinking working-age populations while elderly populations grow. The ratio of working-age adults to elderly residents declines annually. Young people leave for metropolitan employment opportunities. Even substantially higher wages cannot hire workers who do not exist in the community. However, annual turnover exceeding 50% indicates workers leaving, not worker scarcity. Workers exist but choose other employment because nursing homes offer low pay, inadequate benefits, understaffing, and exhausting conditions compared to alternatives.</p>
<p>The Good Samaritan Society pattern illustrates the dynamics at scale. This Sioux Falls-based organization, the largest nonprofit provider of skilled nursing beds nationally, has closed 13 nursing homes in the past three years, predominantly in rural areas. In 2023, the organization announced plans to exit 15 states entirely, consolidating operations to seven Midwestern states where sufficient density enables viable operations. Facilities in communities like Bloomfield, Nebraska (population 1,000) or Miller, South Dakota (population 1,300) simply cannot recruit the workforce required for sustainable operations. The Syracuse, Nebraska facility operates at barely half its licensed capacity because managers cannot find enough staff to care for more residents despite paying certified nursing assistants $21 per hour and registered nurses $40 per hour.</p>
<p>The staffing mandate controversy revealed fundamental tensions between quality goals and capacity constraints. The 2024 Biden administration rule would have required 3.48 hours per resident day of total nursing staff, including 0.55 hours from registered nurses and 2.45 hours from nurse aides. Analysis found only 6% of facilities met all requirements. Rural facilities faced particular challenges: 92% would have needed to hire more RNs to comply with 24/7 RN requirements. The Trump administration rescinded these requirements in December 2025, citing rural and tribal community impacts. Advocates argued the rule would have saved 13,000 lives annually. Industry argued it would have accelerated closures. <strong>Both claims contain truth: adequate staffing improves quality, but mandating staffing without funding staffing closes facilities rather than improving them.</strong></p>
<p>The Syracuse dilemma captures the impossible choice. Lana Obermeyer visits her mother Sharon at the Good Samaritan facility every week. Sharon has advanced Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. The facility operates at half capacity for lack of staff. The memory care unit where Sharon should receive specialized dementia care closed years ago. If Syracuse closed, Sharon would transfer to Lincoln or Omaha, an hour&rsquo;s drive each way. Weekly visits would become monthly. Sharon would spend her final years among strangers. Federal staffing mandates intended to improve care would eliminate care entirely for communities like Syracuse. Is it better to have a nursing home that struggles to hire workers, or no nursing home at all? Syracuse has no good answer. Neither does federal policy.</p>
<p>RHTP addresses rural long-term care tangentially rather than directly. Federal funding targets transformation of healthcare delivery systems, with nursing homes appearing primarily as post-acute partners or aging-in-place barriers rather than transformation subjects themselves. Yet the nursing home crisis directly affects RHTP goals in measurable ways. Hospitals cannot discharge patients when nursing homes have no beds. A 2025 University of Rochester study found that reduced nursing home capacity linked directly to longer hospital stays, especially extended stays of 28 days or more. Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester routinely has 50-75 admitted patients waiting in overflow spaces for inpatient rooms, partly because nursing home bed shortages prevent discharge. For RHTP-funded hospitals pursuing efficiency and transformation, nursing home capacity constraints create direct obstacles. Hospitals cannot redesign patient flow when downstream capacity does not exist.</p>
<p>Aging-in-place initiatives face parallel limitations. RHTP prioritizes home and community-based care that allows people to age in place rather than entering institutional settings, aligning with the 62.5% of rural respondents to the National Health and Aging Trends Study who prefer to receive care in their own home. But aging in place has limits. <strong>When care needs exceed what home and community services can provide, institutional care becomes necessary.</strong> Cognitive decline severe enough to require 24-hour supervision, medical complexity requiring continuous skilled nursing, or family caregiver exhaustion beyond respite services can all necessitate nursing home placement. If nursing home capacity contracts while aging populations grow, the gap creates impossible situations where individuals who need institutional care cannot access it.</p>
<p>RHTP workforce investments target healthcare workers broadly through loan repayment programs, training pipelines, and recruitment initiatives seeking to increase rural healthcare workforce supply. Nursing homes compete for these same workers, but the competition is unequal. Hospital positions typically offer better wages, more predictable schedules, and higher prestige than nursing home positions. Nursing degrees can lead to hospital employment or nursing home employment; graduates typically prefer hospitals. RHTP workforce investments may increase healthcare worker supply overall while doing little for nursing home staffing specifically. State RHTP strategies that fund nursing education without addressing nursing home working conditions may inadvertently worsen nursing home recruitment.</p>
<p>The provider-as-victim narrative contains substantial truth that policy analysis cannot ignore. Medicaid rates are set by government, not providers. Facilities cannot unilaterally raise rates. When government pays 86 cents per dollar of cost, the resulting losses are government-imposed, not provider-chosen. Demanding better quality from underfunded providers represents policy incoherence. The staffing mandate represented an unfunded mandate: requiring facilities to hire workers without providing funding to pay workers shifts costs while claiming to improve quality. COVID was not providers&rsquo; fault, yet the pandemic killed nursing home residents at catastrophic rates, traumatized staff, and imposed massive costs for infection control. Demographic change producing older rural populations and younger population outmigration is structural, not something nursing homes caused or can reverse.</p>
<p>However, the narrative is incomplete. For-profit nursing homes extract profits that could fund wages. Related-party transactions transfer revenue to ownership entities. The claim that reimbursement prevents adequate wages sometimes obscures choices about profit extraction. Some facilities in identical reimbursement environments perform better than others. Leadership, management, culture, and community relationships explain variation that reimbursement alone cannot. Many closed facilities had quality problems before financial problems: four of the 17 Iowa facilities that closed in 2022 were in CMS&rsquo;s special focus program or candidates for it, facing extra scrutiny for poor performance. <strong>Context constrains options; it does not eliminate agency.</strong></p>
<p>Transformation capacity exists unevenly across rural long-term care. Regional scale creates recruitment advantages that standalone facilities cannot match. Facilities operated by regional organizations with multiple locations can offer career advancement, training programs, and transfer opportunities. State Medicaid adequacy enables sustainability: states that have increased Medicaid nursing facility rates substantially, like Wyoming (20% increase in 2023) or Montana (33% increase over two years), give facilities financial capacity for competitive wages. Community engagement sustains facilities in ways that isolated operations cannot achieve. Workforce pipeline investment through CNA</p>
