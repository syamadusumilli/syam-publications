  "articleBody": "Series 7: Healthcare Providers\nRural nursing homes are disappearing. Between February 2020 and July 2024, at least 774 nursing homes closed nationally, displacing more than 28,000 residents. Rural communities absorbed 85% of the county-level losses. Forty additional counties became “nursing home deserts” during this period, places where no skilled nursing facility exists to serve residents requiring institutional care. The closure rate exceeds new facility openings by a factor of more than twenty: while 774 facilities closed, only 37 new facilities opened in 2023.\nThe cause is not mysterious. Nursing homes cannot hire enough workers. Workforce shortages that predated the pandemic accelerated dramatically during it. Nationally, 410,000 workers left nursing homes and long-term care facilities between February 2020 and November 2021. Staffing has recovered only partially, with roughly 103,000 positions refilled. Sixty-six percent of nursing homes report concern that persistent workforce challenges may force closure.\nThis workforce crisis creates a quality trap. Staffing levels correlate with quality outcomes. Facilities that cannot staff adequately produce poor quality metrics. Poor quality metrics generate regulatory problems and low star ratings. Low ratings reduce referrals and census. Reduced census creates financial losses. Financial losses constrain wages and working conditions. Constrained wages worsen recruitment. The spiral feeds itself.\nRHTP addresses rural long-term care tangentially rather than directly. Federal funding targets transformation of healthcare delivery systems, with nursing homes appearing primarily as post-acute partners or aging-in-place barriers rather than transformation subjects themselves. Yet the nursing home crisis directly affects RHTP goals: hospitals cannot discharge patients when nursing homes have no beds; aging-in-place initiatives fail when institutional care is needed but unavailable; workforce pipelines compete for the same scarce workers.\nThis article examines whether rural long-term care facilities can transform their workforce models, what evidence reveals about rural nursing home capacity, and why the current trajectory produces fewer facilities with uncertain quality serving populations that will only grow older.\nInformation Limits\nAnalysis of rural long-term care relies on CMS Nursing Home Compare data, cost reports, and workforce statistics that capture facility-level indicators. These data cannot convey the lived experience of residents displaced when facilities close, families making impossible decisions about loved ones, or workers choosing between caregiving vocations and sustainable employment. The tension between what data reveals and what communities experience defines the limits of this assessment.\nThe Long-Term Care Landscape Facility Types and Definitions Long-term care encompasses multiple facility types serving overlapping but distinct populations:\nSkilled Nursing Facilities (SNFs), commonly called nursing homes, provide 24-hour skilled nursing care, rehabilitation services, and assistance with activities of daily living. Medicare certifies approximately 15,000 SNFs nationally. These facilities serve both long-term residents requiring ongoing institutional care and short-term residents receiving post-acute rehabilitation following hospitalization.\nAssisted Living Facilities (ALFs) provide housing, personal care support, and some health services for people who need help with daily activities but do not require round-the-clock skilled nursing. State regulation varies dramatically; some states closely regulate assisted living while others barely address it. The assisted living sector includes approximately 30,500 communities housing more than 800,000 residents nationally.\nResidential Care Homes, also called board and care homes or adult family homes, provide care in smaller residential settings, typically serving 20 or fewer residents. These facilities offer personal care and supervision but generally not skilled nursing services.\nHome and Community-Based Services (HCBS) deliver care in private residences rather than institutional settings. Medicaid HCBS waivers fund services allowing people who would otherwise require nursing home care to remain at home with support.\nThis article focuses primarily on skilled nursing facilities because they represent the most regulated, most financially stressed, and most RHTP-relevant segment of long-term care. The workforce and quality challenges affecting SNFs, however, ripple through all long-term care settings.\nRural Nursing Home Profile Rural nursing homes differ systematically from their urban counterparts in ways that shape workforce challenges and transformation capacity.\nCharacteristic Rural SNFs Urban SNFs Implication Average Bed Count 60-70 100-120 Fixed costs spread over fewer residents Occupancy Rate 70-75% 80-85% Revenue gaps more severe Ownership Higher nonprofit share Higher for-profit share Different financial incentives Payer Mix Higher Medicaid share More balanced mix Greater reimbursement gap exposure Staffing Hours (HPRD) Similar to urban Similar to rural Quality implications equivalent Star Ratings Comparable overall Comparable overall Quality variation within, not between Geographic distribution concentrates rural nursing homes in the Midwest and Great Plains, where agricultural communities developed institutional care infrastructure during the twentieth century. States like Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, and the Dakotas contain dense networks of small-town nursing homes, many affiliated with church-based organizations or county governments. The South contains significant rural nursing home presence but with different ownership patterns: more for-profit facilities, more corporate chains, and different financial dynamics.\nResident acuity in rural facilities differs from urban patterns. Research from the National Health and Aging Trends Study found that rural nursing home residents required less complex medical care than urban counterparts but had higher rates of cognitive impairment and challenging behaviors such as aggression and wandering. This acuity profile affects staffing needs: rural facilities may need fewer skilled nurses for medical complexity but more staff overall for behavioral management and supervision.\nThe demographic pressure is relentless. Rural populations are older than urban populations and aging faster. The percentage of rural residents over age 65 exceeds 20% nationally and approaches 30% in many agricultural communities. This demographic reality guarantees increasing demand for long-term care precisely as workforce and facility capacity contracts.\nFacility Experience Analysis Facility State Ownership Operating Margin Payer Mix Staff Turnover Star Rating Good Samaritan Society, Syracuse Nebraska Nonprofit Negative 65% Medicaid High 3 stars Good Samaritan Society, Miller South Dakota Nonprofit Negative 70% Medicaid Very High 2 stars Prairie View Health Care Center, Sanborn Iowa Nonprofit Marginal 60% Medicaid Moderate 4 stars Pleasant View Home, Albert City Iowa Nonprofit Negative (Closed) 65% Medicaid High 3 stars Care Initiatives facilities (40+) Iowa Nonprofit Variable 55% Medicaid High Variable Accura HealthCare facilities (34) IA/MN/NE/SD For-profit Variable 60% Medicaid High Variable Patty Elwood Center, Decorah Iowa Nonprofit (Closed) Negative 50% Medicaid Moderate 4 stars St. Mary’s Healthcare Center, Pierre South Dakota Nonprofit Positive 55% Medicaid Moderate 4 stars The Good Samaritan Society pattern illustrates rural nursing home dynamics. This Sioux Falls-based organization, the largest nonprofit provider of skilled nursing beds nationally, has closed 13 nursing homes in the past three years, predominantly in rural areas. In 2023, the organization announced plans to exit 15 states entirely, consolidating operations to seven Midwestern states where it maintains sufficient density for viable operations. Facilities in communities like Bloomfield, Nebraska (population 1,000) or Miller, South Dakota (population 1,300) simply cannot recruit the workforce required for sustainable operations.\nThe Syracuse, Nebraska facility captures the dilemma. The red-brick nursing home serves a farming community of 1,900 people. It operates at barely half its licensed capacity because managers cannot find enough staff to care for more residents. The facility rates three stars overall on Medicare’s comparison website, with four stars for staffing, though reported staff hours per resident day fall below state and national averages. Most residents are local. Most employees are local. Staff care for their former teachers, coaches, and babysitters. They know each other’s families.\nIf the facility closed, many residents would transfer to nursing homes in Lincoln (40 minutes away) or Omaha (an hour away). They would be placed among strangers. Family visits would become exceptional rather than routine. The social fabric that makes institutional care bearable would disappear.\nThe Core Tension: Workforce Attraction vs. Quality Care The fundamental tension in rural long-term care pits workforce attraction against quality care. Facilities that cannot attract workers cannot deliver quality care. Quality requires adequate staffing. Adequate staffing requires competitive compensation. Competitive compensation requires revenue. Revenue requires census. Census requires reputation. Reputation requires quality. The circle closes.\nThe Workforce Attraction View Proponents of this view argue that nursing homes face genuine workforce constraints beyond their control. The arguments include:\nLabor supply is structurally insufficient. Rural areas have shrinking working-age populations. Young people leave for metropolitan employment opportunities. The ratio of working-age adults to elderly residents declines annually. Even if nursing homes paid more, the workers do not exist to hire.\nWage competition is impossible. Nursing homes operate on Medicaid reimbursement that pays 86% of actual costs. Facilities cannot pay competitive wages from rates that do not cover expenses. CNAs start at $21 per hour in some rural facilities and still cannot fill positions. When Dairy Queen, Amazon distribution centers, and meat processing plants compete for the same workers, nursing homes lose.\nThe pandemic destroyed the workforce. COVID killed workers, traumatized survivors, and demonstrated that caregiving careers mean occupational hazard without occupational reward. Workers found less stressful jobs during pandemic recovery and are not returning. The workforce exodus is structural, not temporary.\nRegulation worsens the crisis. Federal staffing mandates (now rescinded) required staffing levels that rural facilities cannot achieve. When regulators demand six registered nurses for around-the-clock coverage, and the community contains fewer than six RNs total, compliance is impossible. Regulation designed for urban facilities closes rural facilities.\nThe Quality Care View Proponents of this view argue that workforce challenges reflect choices, not constraints. The arguments include:\nJob quality determines recruitment. Nursing home staffing issues stem from working conditions, not worker scarcity. Annual turnover exceeding 50% indicates job quality failure, not labor shortage. Workers exist; they choose other employment because nursing homes offer low pay, inadequate benefits, understaffing, and exhausting conditions. Improving job quality would improve recruitment.\nFinancial choices create wage constraints. For-profit facilities extract profits that could fund wages. Nonprofit facilities sometimes maintain excessive reserves or administrative overhead. Related-party transactions transfer facility revenue to ownership entities. The claim that reimbursement prevents adequate wages ignores choices about how revenue is deployed.\nQuality and staffing are causally linked. Research consistently demonstrates that higher staffing levels produce better quality outcomes: fewer falls, fewer pressure ulcers, fewer hospitalizations, lower mortality. Facilities that choose minimal staffing produce poor quality and then blame quality problems on workforce shortages rather than management decisions.\nClosure patterns reveal priorities. Many facilities that closed had poor quality records and low occupancy before closure. The facilities most likely to close are those providing poor care, not those struggling despite good care. Market discipline is working, albeit imperfectly.\nAssessing the Evidence Both perspectives contain validity, but neither fully explains rural nursing home dynamics.\nThe workforce supply constraint is real but not absolute. Rural areas genuinely have fewer working-age adults per elderly resident than urban areas. However, the claim that workers simply do not exist ignores communities where some facilities maintain adequate staffing while nearby facilities cannot. Worker availability varies by facility as well as geography.\nJob quality matters more than advocates acknowledge. The 50% average annual turnover rate in nursing homes indicates workers leaving, not worker scarcity. Facilities with better working conditions, better management, and better cultures retain staff while neighboring facilities churn. Blaming “workforce shortage” for turnover obscures facility-level variation.\nMedicaid reimbursement is genuinely inadequate. The MACPAC finding that Medicaid payments cover only 82-86 cents per dollar of Medicaid resident costs represents real policy failure, not industry excuse-making. Facilities cannot pay competitive wages from inadequate reimbursement. Demanding quality without funding quality is policy incoherence.\nThe staffing mandate debate revealed genuine tensions. The 2024 Biden administration staffing rule would have required 3.48 hours per resident day of total nursing staff, including 0.55 hours from registered nurses and 2.45 hours from nurse aides. Analysis found only 6% of facilities met all requirements. Rural facilities faced particular challenges: 92% of rural facilities would have needed to hire more RNs to comply with 24/7 RN requirements.\nThe Trump administration rescinded these requirements in December 2025, citing rural and tribal community impacts. Advocates argued the rule would have saved 13,000 lives annually; industry argued it would have accelerated closures. Both claims contain truth: adequate staffing improves quality, but mandating staffing without funding staffing closes facilities rather than improving them.\nCase Study: The Syracuse Dilemma Lana Obermeyer visits her mother at the Good Samaritan Society nursing home in Syracuse, Nebraska every week. Sharon Hudson, 75, has advanced Alzheimer’s disease. She no longer recognizes her daughter consistently, but she smiles and giggles when Lana arrives. The staff know Sharon’s preferences, her history, her family. They have cared for her for five years.\nThe facility has problems. It operates at half capacity because managers cannot hire enough workers. The memory care unit where Sharon should ideally receive specialized dementia care closed years ago for lack of staff. The wing sits dark. Sharon receives general nursing home care rather than memory care because memory care is unavailable in Syracuse.\nWhen federal regulators proposed minimum staffing requirements, Syracuse needed to hire several more aides and an overnight registered nurse. The community has about 1,900 people. Where would Syracuse find these workers? Good Samaritan’s CEO noted that some of their facilities have not had a night nurse for three years or more.\nIf Syracuse closed, Sharon would transfer to Lincoln or Omaha. An hour’s drive each way. Lana works; she cannot visit daily even now. Weekly visits would become monthly. Sharon would be surrounded by strangers during the final years of her life.\n“I truly think it would kill half of these people,” Lana says.\nThe staffing mandate, she acknowledges, was intended to improve care. But improving care at the cost of eliminating care serves no one. Is it better to have a nursing home that struggles to hire workers, or no nursing home at all?\nSyracuse has no good answer. Neither does federal policy.\nThe Financial Death Spiral Revenue Constraints Rural nursing homes face systematic revenue disadvantages that limit their capacity to compete for workers or invest in quality improvement.\nMedicaid dominates the payer mix. Rural facilities typically receive 60-70% of their revenue from Medicaid, compared to more balanced payer mixes in urban facilities. Medicaid is the largest payer for nursing home care nationally, covering approximately 59% of nursing facility residents, but rural facilities exceed this average.\nMedicaid rates do not cover costs. ASPE analysis found that Medicaid payments cover only 82 cents per dollar of costs incurred caring for Medicaid residents. MACPAC’s median finding was 86 cents per dollar. For approximately 40% of nursing homes, Medicaid payments covered 80% or less of Medicaid costs. These losses must be absorbed or offset by other payers.\nMedicare provides offset but limited volume. Medicare reimburses nursing homes for post-acute skilled nursing care following hospitalization, and these rates typically exceed costs. However, Medicare stays are short-term (average under 30 days) and require clinical documentation justifying skilled care. Rural facilities often have lower Medicare volume than urban counterparts, limiting their ability to offset Medicaid losses with Medicare profits.\nCommercial payers are scarce. Private pay and commercial insurance represent a small share of rural nursing home revenue. The populations that carry commercial insurance or can afford private pay rates are precisely the populations leaving rural areas for metropolitan employment.\nThe math does not work. A facility receiving 65% of revenue from Medicaid at 86% of cost, 25% from Medicare at 110% of cost, and 10% from private pay at 120% of cost generates: (0.65 Ãƒâ€” 0.86) + (0.25 Ãƒâ€” 1.10) + (0.10 Ãƒâ€” 1.20) = 0.559 + 0.275 + 0.120 = 0.954, or 95.4% of costs covered. Operating on 4.6% negative margins is unsustainable.\nCost Pressures While revenues are constrained, costs have escalated dramatically.\nLabor costs have surged. Nursing homes have raised wages significantly since 2020, with some facilities increasing CNA starting wages by 30% or more. These increases were necessary to compete for workers but compress already-thin margins. Nebraska facilities report CNA starting wages of $21 per hour and RN wages of $40 per hour, levels that would have seemed generous five years ago but now barely compete with alternative employment.\nAgency staffing is expensive. When facilities cannot hire permanent staff, they turn to staffing agencies that charge premium rates. Agency staff cost 50-100% more than equivalent permanent employees. A facility relying on agency staffing to meet basic requirements faces structural losses on every shift.\nInflation hit everything. Food costs, utility costs, insurance costs, and supply costs all increased during the post-pandemic period. Medicaid rate increases, where they occurred, often lagged inflation. The gap between cost increases and reimbursement increases widened.\nCapital needs go unmet. Rural nursing homes often occupy aging buildings requiring renovation or replacement. But facilities operating on negative margins cannot invest in capital improvements. Deferred maintenance accumulates, eventually creating regulatory compliance problems that compound financial stress.\nThe Result: Closure or Decline Facilities facing these financial dynamics face limited options:\nClosure. The most financially distressed facilities close, displacing residents and eliminating jobs. The 774 closures since February 2020 represent this outcome. Each closure creates a nursing home desert or deepens an existing one.\nAdmission limitation. Facilities unable to staff to capacity limit admissions. Forty-six percent of nursing homes currently limit new admissions due to staffing constraints. Fifty-seven percent have waiting lists. Twenty percent have closed units, wings, or floors. Capacity exists on paper but not in reality.\nQuality decline. Facilities operating with minimal staff produce poor quality outcomes. Quality problems generate regulatory citations, low star ratings, and reputational damage. The downward spiral continues.\nOwnership transfer. Some struggling facilities transfer to new operators, often for-profit chains willing to accept lower staffing levels or regional operators seeking geographic expansion. Whether ownership transfer improves or worsens outcomes varies by acquirer.\nAlternative Perspective: The Provider as Victim View The nursing home industry argues, with substantial justification, that providers face genuine policy failure. The argument deserves serious engagement:\nMedicaid rates are set by government, not providers. Facilities cannot unilaterally raise rates. When government pays 86 cents per dollar of cost, the resulting losses are government-imposed, not provider-chosen. Demanding better quality from underfunded providers is policy incoherence.\nThe staffing mandate represented unfunded mandate. Requiring facilities to hire workers without providing funding to pay workers shifts costs while claiming to improve quality. If government wants specific staffing levels, government should fund specific staffing levels. Otherwise, the mandate simply accelerates closure.\nCOVID was not providers’ fault. The pandemic killed nursing home residents at catastrophic rates, traumatized staff, and imposed massive costs for infection control. Providers did not create the pandemic. Government responses, including some that restricted visitor access and harmed resident wellbeing, were government decisions. Blaming providers for pandemic outcomes ignores context.\nDemographic change is structural. The aging of rural America is not something nursing homes caused or can reverse. The shrinking of rural working-age populations is not something nursing homes caused or can reverse. Demanding that providers solve structural demographic challenges is unrealistic.\nAssessment The provider-as-victim narrative contains substantial truth. Medicaid underfunding is real. Unfunded mandates are real. Pandemic impacts were real. Demographic pressures are real. Providers operate within constraints they did not create and cannot unilaterally change.\nHowever, the narrative is incomplete:\nOwnership matters. For-profit nursing homes extract profits that could fund wages. Related-party transactions transfer revenue to ownership entities. The claim that “reimbursement” prevents adequate wages sometimes obscures choices about profit extraction.\nVariation exists. Some facilities in identical reimbursement environments perform better than others. Leadership, management, culture, and community relationships explain variation that reimbursement alone cannot. Provider victimhood is context; leadership is variable.\nQuality variation precedes closure. Many closed facilities had quality problems before financial problems. Four of the 17 Iowa facilities that closed in 2022 were in CMS’s special focus program or candidates for it, facing extra scrutiny for poor performance. The narrative that good facilities close due to external pressure ignores that struggling facilities often struggled for internal reasons.\nThe honest assessment: Long-term care faces genuine policy failure. But policy failure does not excuse facility-level choices that worsen outcomes. Context constrains options; it does not eliminate agency.\nCase Study: When Good Sam Left Town The City of Mott, North Dakota contains 685 residents. Good Samaritan Society operated a nursing home there for decades, serving elders who had lived their entire lives in the surrounding agricultural community. In 2022, Good Samaritan announced the facility would close. The community formed a working group to develop alternatives.\nThe community proposed that Sanford Health, Good Samaritan’s parent organization, allow use of the facility for senior care under different management. Sanford declined. The facility closed. The building was listed for sale with a stipulation that it cannot be used for rendering health care services of any kind.\nWhy would a health system prevent a community from providing health services in an existing healthcare facility? The answer likely involves liability concerns, licensing complications, and organizational priorities. Whatever the reason, the result was clear: 32 residents displaced, 30 staff unemployed, and a community permanently denied institutional care for its elders.\nMott residents requiring nursing home care now travel to facilities in other communities. Those without transportation, without family to arrange visits, without resources to bridge distance, face isolation from everything they have known.\nThe Good Samaritan Society, founded in 1922 by a Lutheran pastor in Arthur, North Dakota, began with the mission of caring for aging members of rural congregations. A century later, the organization bearing that mission withdrew from rural communities because mission could not overcome financial reality.\n“We can’t find staff,” explained Good Samaritan’s CEO. “We had plenty of people to serve, 32 residents, roughly 30 staff members, but we didn’t see a sustainable future largely because we didn’t have the workforce in place.”\nThe workforce problem is real. The solution, withdrawal from rural communities, is also real. Mission alone does not employ nurses.\nImplications for RHTP RHTP addresses rural healthcare transformation but engages long-term care indirectly. The implications of nursing home decline for RHTP goals deserve explicit attention.\nHospital Discharge Challenges Nursing homes provide post-acute care for patients discharged from hospitals following acute illness, surgery, or injury. When nursing home beds are unavailable, hospitals cannot discharge patients who no longer require acute care but still require skilled nursing.\nThe result is ALC (Alternative Level of Care) patients occupying hospital beds. A 2025 study from the University of Rochester found that reduced nursing home capacity was linked to longer hospital stays, especially extended stays of 28 days or more. Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester routinely has 50-75 admitted patients waiting in overflow spaces for inpatient rooms, partly because nursing home bed shortages prevent discharge.\nFor RHTP-funded hospitals pursuing efficiency and transformation, nursing home capacity constraints create direct obstacles. Hospitals cannot redesign patient flow when downstream capacity does not exist. Length of stay metrics deteriorate when discharge destinations are unavailable.\nAging in Place Limitations RHTP prioritizes home and community-based care that allows people to age in place rather than entering institutional settings. The policy preference for HCBS over institutional care aligns with resident preferences: 62.5% of rural respondents to the National Health and Aging Trends Study expressed preference to receive care in their own home.\nBut aging in place has limits. When care needs exceed what home and community services can provide, institutional care becomes necessary. Cognitive decline severe enough to require 24-hour supervision, medical complexity requiring continuous skilled nursing, or family caregiver exhaustion beyond respite services can all necessitate nursing home placement.\nIf nursing home capacity contracts while aging populations grow, the gap creates impossible situations. Individuals who need institutional care cannot access it. Family caregivers facing impossible burdens receive no relief. The preference for aging in place becomes abandonment when alternatives to institutional care are unavailable.\nWorkforce Competition RHTP workforce investments target healthcare workers broadly. Loan repayment programs, training pipelines, and recruitment initiatives seek to increase rural healthcare workforce supply. Nursing homes compete for these same workers.\nThe competition is unequal. Hospital positions typically offer better wages, more predictable schedules, and higher prestige than nursing home positions. Nursing degrees can lead to hospital employment or nursing home employment; graduates typically prefer hospitals. RHTP workforce investments may increase healthcare worker supply overall while doing little for nursing home staffing specifically.\nState RHTP strategies that fund nursing education without addressing nursing home working conditions may inadvertently worsen nursing home recruitment. More nurses choosing hospital employment means more nurses not choosing nursing home employment.\nQuality and Accountability RHTP emphasizes quality measurement and outcome improvement. CMS tracks nursing home quality through the Five-Star Quality Rating System, combining health inspection results, staffing measures, and quality measures into overall ratings.\nRural nursing homes that cannot staff adequately cannot achieve quality ratings that reflect their communities’ needs. The quality measurement system designed to drive improvement instead documents decline. Facilities receiving two-star ratings for staffing shortage face reputational damage that compounds recruitment challenges.\nRHTP accountability frameworks that penalize facilities for quality problems may accelerate closure rather than improvement. If quality metrics reflect workforce constraints beyond facility control, quality-based accountability is measuring the wrong thing.\nWhen Long-Term Care Can Transform Despite structural challenges, some rural long-term care facilities demonstrate transformation capacity. The conditions enabling transformation merit attention:\nRegional scale creates recruitment advantages. Facilities operated by regional organizations with multiple locations can offer career advancement, training programs, and transfer opportunities that standalone facilities cannot match. Good Samaritan’s consolidation to seven Midwestern states reflects this logic: concentration enables investment that dispersion prevents.\nState Medicaid adequacy enables sustainability. States that have increased Medicaid nursing facility rates substantially, like Wyoming (20% increase in 2023) or Montana (33% increase over two years), give facilities financial capacity for competitive wages. States with chronically inadequate Medicaid rates produce chronic facility distress.\nCommunity engagement sustains facilities. Facilities embedded in community life, supported by local governments, engaged with local employers, and integrated with community institutions demonstrate greater resilience than facilities lacking community connection. Community ownership, whether through nonprofit governance or county operation, creates accountability to residents rather than distant shareholders.\nWorkforce pipeline investment pays off. Facilities that invest in CNA training programs, tuition reimbursement, and career ladders from entry-level to professional positions can develop workforce rather than merely recruiting it. Pipeline investment requires financial capacity, but facilities that achieve capacity can build sustainable workforce strategies.\nTechnology extends workforce capacity. Telehealth for physician services, remote monitoring for clinical status, and operational technology for documentation and care coordination can extend what limited staff can accomplish. Technology does not replace workers but can make workers more effective.\nWhen Long-Term Care Cannot Transform Many rural long-term care facilities lack transformation capacity. Honest assessment requires acknowledging these limitations:\nStandalone facilities in shrinking communities face structural decline. A single nursing home in a community of 700 people with declining population has no recruitment base, no regional support structure, and no path to sustainability. Transformation cannot overcome demographic math.\nFacilities dependent on inadequate Medicaid cannot compete for workers. Without state action on Medicaid rates, facilities receiving 86 cents per dollar of cost cannot pay competitive wages. Transformation requires financial foundation; underfunding eliminates foundation.\nFacilities with poor quality histories face reputational barriers. Facilities in CMS special focus programs, with histories of serious deficiencies, face recruitment challenges beyond normal workforce constraints. Workers choose where to work; they avoid facilities with poor reputations.\nFacilities without leadership capacity cannot implement change. Transformation requires management capacity to redesign operations, implement new models, and sustain change. Facilities struggling to maintain basic operations lack bandwidth for transformation. Survival consumes all attention.\nFacilities serving communities without alternatives face closure, not transformation. When the choice is inadequate care or no care, policy should honestly acknowledge that some communities will lose nursing home access regardless of intervention.\nRecommendations For Long-Term Care Providers Assess sustainability honestly. Facilities facing structural challenges should evaluate whether transformation can achieve sustainability or whether managed transition serves communities better. Planned closure with resident transfer beats unplanned collapse.\nPursue regional affiliation. Standalone facilities facing workforce and financial challenges should explore affiliation with regional organizations that can provide support, resources, and career pathways. Independence that cannot sustain operations is not worth preserving.\nInvest in workforce development. Facilities with financial capacity should develop training pipelines, career advancement structures, and retention programs. Recruiting from a fixed labor pool is zero-sum; developing workers expands the pool.\nEngage communities. Facilities embedded in community life demonstrate greater resilience. Boards with community representation, volunteer programs, family councils, and local partnerships create accountability and support that isolated facilities lack.\nFor State Agencies Prioritize Medicaid rate adequacy. State Medicaid rates determine nursing home sustainability more than any other policy lever. States with adequate rates have sustainable facilities; states with inadequate rates have closing facilities. The connection is direct.\nAssess transformation capacity realistically. Not all nursing homes can transform. State RHTP strategies should differentiate between facilities that can transform with support, facilities that need stabilization before transformation, and facilities that may close despite intervention.\nCoordinate workforce investments. RHTP workforce funding should explicitly address long-term care alongside acute care. Training programs, loan repayment, and recruitment initiatives should include nursing home positions, not just hospital positions.\nConsider alternatives to institutional care. State HCBS capacity affects nursing home demand. Robust home and community-based services allow some individuals to avoid institutional placement, but only if HCBS infrastructure exists. Developing HCBS while nursing homes close requires careful sequencing.\nFor CMS Accept that long-term care is part of rural health transformation. RHTP frameworks that ignore nursing homes while funding hospitals address only part of the system. Discharge bottlenecks, workforce competition, and aging-in-place failures all connect to nursing home capacity.\nFund workforce without mandating workforce. The staffing mandate controversy revealed genuine tension between quality goals and capacity constraints. Funding nursing home workforce development, CNA training, and retention programs could improve staffing without mandating levels that trigger closure.\nAcknowledge nursing home deserts as access problem. CMS tracks hospital closures and healthcare shortage areas. Nursing home deserts receive less systematic attention despite comparable access implications. Surveillance and response systems for nursing home capacity contraction would enable more timely intervention.\nConclusion Rural long-term care facilities embody the workforce versus quality tension with particular intensity. They cannot attract workers because they cannot pay competitive wages. They cannot pay competitive wages because Medicaid does not cover costs. They cannot improve quality without adequate staffing. They cannot achieve adequate staffing without financial foundation. Each element reinforces the others.\nRHTP transformation goals cannot succeed if nursing homes disappear. Hospitals cannot discharge patients to facilities that do not exist. Aging-in-place works until it does not, and when institutional care is needed, someone must provide it. Workforce pipelines that ignore long-term care produce workers who avoid long-term care employment.\nThe evidence suggests that some rural nursing homes can achieve sustainability through regional affiliation, adequate Medicaid rates, workforce development investment, and community engagement. Many cannot. The transformation capacity that policy assumes does not exist uniformly across 15,000 nursing facilities or 3,000+ rural nursing homes.\nHonest assessment requires accepting that some communities will lose nursing home access. The demographic math of shrinking working-age populations serving expanding elderly populations in places that cannot attract workers produces predictable outcomes. Transformation cannot repeal mathematics.\nWhat policy can do is distinguish between facilities that can transform with support and facilities that face structural impossibility. It can fund Medicaid adequately in states willing to act. It can invest in workforce pipelines that include long-term care. It can develop home and community-based alternatives for people who can avoid institutional care. And it can help communities plan for managed transitions when closure becomes inevitable.\nThe alternative, pretending that all nursing homes can transform if they try harder, serves no one. Rural elders deserve honesty about what transformation can and cannot accomplish in the communities where they live and where they hope to age.\nCross-References Series 4: Transformation Approaches\nArticle 4A: Aging in Place (HCBS alternatives to institutional care) Article 4B: Workforce Development (long-term care workforce context) Series 7: Healthcare Providers\nArticle 7A: Critical Access Hospitals (discharge coordination) Article 7B: Rural Health Clinics (primary care linkage) Article 7E: EMS (emergency transport from nursing homes) Series 7 Technical Documents\nTD-B: Provider Reimbursement Comparison Matrix (Medicaid rate context) Sources American Health Care Association/National Center for Assisted Living. “2024 Access to Care Report.” AHCA/NCAL, August 2024. https://www.ahcancal.org/Data-and-Research/Pages/Staffing-Mandate-Analysis.aspx.\nAmerican Health Care Association/National Center for Assisted Living. “Staffing Mandate Analysis.” AHCA/NCAL, 2024. https://www.ahcancal.org/Data-and-Research/Pages/Staffing-Mandate-Analysis.aspx.\nASPE Office of Behavioral Health, Disability, and Aging Policy. “Assessing Medicaid Payment Rates and Costs of Caring for the Medicaid Population Residing in Nursing Homes: Final Report.” U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2023. https://aspe.hhs.gov/reports/assessing-medicaid-payments-costs-nursing-homes.\nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services. “Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Minimum Staffing Standards for Long-Term Care Facilities and Medicaid Institutional Payment Transparency Reporting Final Rule (CMS 3442-F).” Federal Register, May 10, 2024. https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/05/10/2024-08273/.\nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services. “Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Repeal of Minimum Staffing Standards for Long-Term Care Facilities.” Federal Register, December 3, 2025. https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/12/03/2025-21792/.\nKFF. “50 State Medicaid Budget Survey FY 2023-2024: Provider Rates and Taxes.” Kaiser Family Foundation, September 2025. https://www.kff.org/report-section/50-state-medicaid-budget-survey-fy-2023-2024-provider-rates-and-taxes/.\nLeys, Tony. “Rural Nursing Home Operators Say New Staff Rules Would Cause More Closures.” NPR/KFF Health News, September 14, 2023. https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/09/14/1199317652/rural-nursing-home-workforce-closures-staffing-minimums.\nMACPAC. “Estimates of Medicaid Nursing Facility Payments Relative to Costs.” Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission, January 2023. https://www.macpac.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Estimates-of-Medicaid-Nursing-Facility-Payments-Relative-to-Costs-1-6-23.pdf.\nMcGarry, Brian E., et al. “Decline in U.S. Nursing Home Capacity Since COVID-19: Rural Areas Hit Hardest.” University of Rochester Medical Center Newsroom, January 2026. https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/news/story/decline-in-u-s-nursing-home-capacity-since-covid-19-rural-areas-hit-hardest.\nMcKnight’s Long-Term Care News. “BREAKING: Good Samaritan Society to Exit 15 States, Trim Capacity by 30 Percent.” McKnight’s, January 2023. https://www.mcknights.com/news/breaking-good-samaritan-society-to-exit-15-states-trim-capacity-by-30-percent/.\nRural Health Information Hub. “Rural Long-Term Care Facilities Overview.” RHIhub, accessed January 2026. https://www.ruralhealthinfo.org/topics/long-term-care.\nSkilled Nursing News. “‘A National Crisis’: New AHCA Report Shows Alarming Trends in Nursing Home Access.” Skilled Nursing News, August 23, 2024. https://skillednursingnews.com/2024/08/a-national-crisis-new-ahca-report-shows-alarming-trends-in-nursing-home-access/.\nThe Consumer Voice. “CMS Takes Action to Rescind Minimum Staffing Rule.” National Consumer Voice for Quality Long-Term Care, December 3, 2025. https://theconsumervoice.org/news/cms-takes-action-to-rescind-minimum-staffing-rule/.\nArticle 7.F Series 7: Healthcare Providers Rural Health Transformation Project Version 1: January 2026\n",

<p><strong>Series 7: Healthcare Providers</strong></p>
<p>Rural nursing homes are disappearing. Between February 2020 and July 2024, <strong>at least 774 nursing homes closed nationally</strong>, displacing more than 28,000 residents. Rural communities absorbed 85% of the county-level losses. Forty additional counties became &ldquo;nursing home deserts&rdquo; during this period, places where no skilled nursing facility exists to serve residents requiring institutional care. The closure rate exceeds new facility openings by a factor of more than twenty: while 774 facilities closed, only 37 new facilities opened in 2023.</p>
<p>The cause is not mysterious. <strong>Nursing homes cannot hire enough workers.</strong> Workforce shortages that predated the pandemic accelerated dramatically during it. Nationally, 410,000 workers left nursing homes and long-term care facilities between February 2020 and November 2021. Staffing has recovered only partially, with roughly 103,000 positions refilled. Sixty-six percent of nursing homes report concern that persistent workforce challenges may force closure.</p>
<p>This workforce crisis creates a quality trap. Staffing levels correlate with quality outcomes. Facilities that cannot staff adequately produce poor quality metrics. Poor quality metrics generate regulatory problems and low star ratings. Low ratings reduce referrals and census. Reduced census creates financial losses. Financial losses constrain wages and working conditions. Constrained wages worsen recruitment. <strong>The spiral feeds itself.</strong></p>
<p>RHTP addresses rural long-term care tangentially rather than directly. Federal funding targets transformation of healthcare delivery systems, with nursing homes appearing primarily as post-acute partners or aging-in-place barriers rather than transformation subjects themselves. Yet the nursing home crisis directly affects RHTP goals: hospitals cannot discharge patients when nursing homes have no beds; aging-in-place initiatives fail when institutional care is needed but unavailable; workforce pipelines compete for the same scarce workers.</p>
<p>This article examines whether rural long-term care facilities can transform their workforce models, what evidence reveals about rural nursing home capacity, and why the current trajectory produces fewer facilities with uncertain quality serving populations that will only grow older.</p>
<p><strong>Information Limits</strong></p>
<p>Analysis of rural long-term care relies on CMS Nursing Home Compare data, cost reports, and workforce statistics that capture facility-level indicators. These data cannot convey the lived experience of residents displaced when facilities close, families making impossible decisions about loved ones, or workers choosing between caregiving vocations and sustainable employment. The tension between what data reveals and what communities experience defines the limits of this assessment.</p>

<h3 id="facility-types-and-definitions">Facility Types and Definitions<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#facility-types-and-definitions">#</a></h3>
<p>Long-term care encompasses multiple facility types serving overlapping but distinct populations:</p>
<p><strong>Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNFs)</strong>, commonly called nursing homes, provide 24-hour skilled nursing care, rehabilitation services, and assistance with activities of daily living. Medicare certifies approximately 15,000 SNFs nationally. These facilities serve both long-term residents requiring ongoing institutional care and short-term residents receiving post-acute rehabilitation following hospitalization.</p>
<p><strong>Assisted Living Facilities (ALFs)</strong> provide housing, personal care support, and some health services for people who need help with daily activities but do not require round-the-clock skilled nursing. State regulation varies dramatically; some states closely regulate assisted living while others barely address it. The assisted living sector includes approximately 30,500 communities housing more than 800,000 residents nationally.</p>
<p><strong>Residential Care Homes</strong>, also called board and care homes or adult family homes, provide care in smaller residential settings, typically serving 20 or fewer residents. These facilities offer personal care and supervision but generally not skilled nursing services.</p>
<p><strong>Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS)</strong> deliver care in private residences rather than institutional settings. Medicaid HCBS waivers fund services allowing people who would otherwise require nursing home care to remain at home with support.</p>
<p>This article focuses primarily on skilled nursing facilities because they represent the most regulated, most financially stressed, and most RHTP-relevant segment of long-term care. The workforce and quality challenges affecting SNFs, however, ripple through all long-term care settings.</p>

<p><strong>Geographic distribution</strong> concentrates rural nursing homes in the Midwest and Great Plains, where agricultural communities developed institutional care infrastructure during the twentieth century. States like Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, and the Dakotas contain dense networks of small-town nursing homes, many affiliated with church-based organizations or county governments. The South contains significant rural nursing home presence but with different ownership patterns: more for-profit facilities, more corporate chains, and different financial dynamics.</p>
<p><strong>Resident acuity in rural facilities differs from urban patterns.</strong> Research from the National Health and Aging Trends Study found that rural nursing home residents required less complex medical care than urban counterparts but had higher rates of cognitive impairment and challenging behaviors such as aggression and wandering. This acuity profile affects staffing needs: rural facilities may need fewer skilled nurses for medical complexity but more staff overall for behavioral management and supervision.</p>
<p><strong>The demographic pressure is relentless.</strong> Rural populations are older than urban populations and aging faster. The percentage of rural residents over age 65 exceeds 20% nationally and approaches 30% in many agricultural communities. This demographic reality guarantees increasing demand for long-term care precisely as workforce and facility capacity contracts.</p>

<p>The Good Samaritan Society pattern illustrates rural nursing home dynamics. This Sioux Falls-based organization, the largest nonprofit provider of skilled nursing beds nationally, has closed 13 nursing homes in the past three years, predominantly in rural areas. In 2023, the organization announced plans to exit 15 states entirely, consolidating operations to seven Midwestern states where it maintains sufficient density for viable operations. Facilities in communities like Bloomfield, Nebraska (population 1,000) or Miller, South Dakota (population 1,300) simply cannot recruit the workforce required for sustainable operations.</p>
<p>The Syracuse, Nebraska facility captures the dilemma. The red-brick nursing home serves a farming community of 1,900 people. It operates at barely half its licensed capacity because managers cannot find enough staff to care for more residents. The facility rates three stars overall on Medicare&rsquo;s comparison website, with four stars for staffing, though reported staff hours per resident day fall below state and national averages. Most residents are local. Most employees are local. Staff care for their former teachers, coaches, and babysitters. They know each other&rsquo;s families.</p>
<p><strong>If the facility closed, many residents would transfer to nursing homes in Lincoln (40 minutes away) or Omaha (an hour away).</strong> They would be placed among strangers. Family visits would become exceptional rather than routine. The social fabric that makes institutional care bearable would disappear.</p>
<h2 id="the-core-tension-workforce-attraction-vs-quality-care">The Core Tension: Workforce Attraction vs. Quality Care<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-core-tension-workforce-attraction-vs-quality-care">#</a></h2>
<p>The fundamental tension in rural long-term care pits <strong>workforce attraction against quality care</strong>. Facilities that cannot attract workers cannot deliver quality care. Quality requires adequate staffing. Adequate staffing requires competitive compensation. Competitive compensation requires revenue. Revenue requires census. Census requires reputation. Reputation requires quality. <strong>The circle closes.</strong></p>
<h3 id="the-workforce-attraction-view">The Workforce Attraction View<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-workforce-attraction-view">#</a></h3>
<p>Proponents of this view argue that nursing homes face genuine workforce constraints beyond their control. The arguments include:</p>
<p><strong>Labor supply is structurally insufficient.</strong> Rural areas have shrinking working-age populations. Young people leave for metropolitan employment opportunities. The ratio of working-age adults to elderly residents declines annually. Even if nursing homes paid more, the workers do not exist to hire.</p>
<p><strong>Wage competition is impossible.</strong> Nursing homes operate on Medicaid reimbursement that pays 86% of actual costs. Facilities cannot pay competitive wages from rates that do not cover expenses. CNAs start at $21 per hour in some rural facilities and still cannot fill positions. When Dairy Queen, Amazon distribution centers, and meat processing plants compete for the same workers, nursing homes lose.</p>
<p><strong>The pandemic destroyed the workforce.</strong> COVID killed workers, traumatized survivors, and demonstrated that caregiving careers mean occupational hazard without occupational reward. Workers found less stressful jobs during pandemic recovery and are not returning. The workforce exodus is structural, not temporary.</p>
<p><strong>Regulation worsens the crisis.</strong> Federal staffing mandates (now rescinded) required staffing levels that rural facilities cannot achieve. When regulators demand six registered nurses for around-the-clock coverage, and the community contains fewer than six RNs total, compliance is impossible. Regulation designed for urban facilities closes rural facilities.</p>
<h3 id="the-quality-care-view">The Quality Care View<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-quality-care-view">#</a></h3>
<p>Proponents of this view argue that workforce challenges reflect choices, not constraints. The arguments include:</p>
<p><strong>Job quality determines recruitment.</strong> Nursing home staffing issues stem from working conditions, not worker scarcity. Annual turnover exceeding 50% indicates job quality failure, not labor shortage. Workers exist; they choose other employment because nursing homes offer low pay, inadequate benefits, understaffing, and exhausting conditions. Improving job quality would improve recruitment.</p>
<p><strong>Financial choices create wage constraints.</strong> For-profit facilities extract profits that could fund wages. Nonprofit facilities sometimes maintain excessive reserves or administrative overhead. Related-party transactions transfer facility revenue to ownership entities. The claim that reimbursement prevents adequate wages ignores choices about how revenue is deployed.</p>
<p><strong>Quality and staffing are causally linked.</strong> Research consistently demonstrates that higher staffing levels produce better quality outcomes: fewer falls, fewer pressure ulcers, fewer hospitalizations, lower mortality. Facilities that choose minimal staffing produce poor quality and then blame quality problems on workforce shortages rather than management decisions.</p>
<p><strong>Closure patterns reveal priorities.</strong> Many facilities that closed had poor quality records and low occupancy before closure. The facilities most likely to close are those providing poor care, not those struggling despite good care. Market discipline is working, albeit imperfectly.</p>
<h3 id="assessing-the-evidence">Assessing the Evidence<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#assessing-the-evidence">#</a></h3>
<p>Both perspectives contain validity, but neither fully explains rural nursing home dynamics.</p>
<p><strong>The workforce supply constraint is real but not absolute.</strong> Rural areas genuinely have fewer working-age adults per elderly resident than urban areas. However, the claim that workers simply do not exist ignores communities where some facilities maintain adequate staffing while nearby facilities cannot. Worker availability varies by facility as well as geography.</p>
<p><strong>Job quality matters more than advocates acknowledge.</strong> The 50% average annual turnover rate in nursing homes indicates workers leaving, not worker scarcity. Facilities with better working conditions, better management, and better cultures retain staff while neighboring facilities churn. Blaming &ldquo;workforce shortage&rdquo; for turnover obscures facility-level variation.</p>
<p><strong>Medicaid reimbursement is genuinely inadequate.</strong> The MACPAC finding that Medicaid payments cover only 82-86 cents per dollar of Medicaid resident costs represents real policy failure, not industry excuse-making. Facilities cannot pay competitive wages from inadequate reimbursement. Demanding quality without funding quality is policy incoherence.</p>
<p><strong>The staffing mandate debate revealed genuine tensions.</strong> The 2024 Biden administration staffing rule would have required 3.48 hours per resident day of total nursing staff, including 0.55 hours from registered nurses and 2.45 hours from nurse aides. Analysis found only 6% of facilities met all requirements. Rural facilities faced particular challenges: 92% of rural facilities would have needed to hire more RNs to comply with 24/7 RN requirements.</p>
<p>The Trump administration rescinded these requirements in December 2025, citing rural and tribal community impacts. Advocates argued the rule would have saved 13,000 lives annually; industry argued it would have accelerated closures. Both claims contain truth: <strong>adequate staffing improves quality, but mandating staffing without funding staffing closes facilities rather than improving them.</strong></p>
<h2 id="case-study-the-syracuse-dilemma">Case Study: The Syracuse Dilemma<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#case-study-the-syracuse-dilemma">#</a></h2>
<p>Lana Obermeyer visits her mother at the Good Samaritan Society nursing home in Syracuse, Nebraska every week. Sharon Hudson, 75, has advanced Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. She no longer recognizes her daughter consistently, but she smiles and giggles when Lana arrives. The staff know Sharon&rsquo;s preferences, her history, her family. They have cared for her for five years.</p>
<p>The facility has problems. It operates at half capacity because managers cannot hire enough workers. The memory care unit where Sharon should ideally receive specialized dementia care closed years ago for lack of staff. The wing sits dark. Sharon receives general nursing home care rather than memory care because memory care is unavailable in Syracuse.</p>
<p>When federal regulators proposed minimum staffing requirements, Syracuse needed to hire several more aides and an overnight registered nurse. The community has about 1,900 people. Where would Syracuse find these workers? Good Samaritan&rsquo;s CEO noted that some of their facilities have not had a night nurse for three years or more.</p>
<p>If Syracuse closed, Sharon would transfer to Lincoln or Omaha. An hour&rsquo;s drive each way. Lana works; she cannot visit daily even now. Weekly visits would become monthly. Sharon would be surrounded by strangers during the final years of her life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I truly think it would kill half of these people,&rdquo; Lana says.</p>
<p>The staffing mandate, she acknowledges, was intended to improve care. But improving care at the cost of eliminating care serves no one. Is it better to have a nursing home that struggles to hire workers, or no nursing home at all?</p>
<p>Syracuse has no good answer. Neither does federal policy.</p>
<h2 id="the-financial-death-spiral">The Financial Death Spiral<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-financial-death-spiral">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="revenue-constraints">Revenue Constraints<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#revenue-constraints">#</a></h3>
<p>Rural nursing homes face systematic revenue disadvantages that limit their capacity to compete for workers or invest in quality improvement.</p>
<p><strong>Medicaid dominates the payer mix.</strong> Rural facilities typically receive 60-70% of their revenue from Medicaid, compared to more balanced payer mixes in urban facilities. Medicaid is the largest payer for nursing home care nationally, covering approximately 59% of nursing facility residents, but rural facilities exceed this average.</p>
<p><strong>Medicaid rates do not cover costs.</strong> ASPE analysis found that Medicaid payments cover only 82 cents per dollar of costs incurred caring for Medicaid residents. MACPAC&rsquo;s median finding was 86 cents per dollar. For approximately 40% of nursing homes, Medicaid payments covered 80% or less of Medicaid costs. These losses must be absorbed or offset by other payers.</p>
<p><strong>Medicare provides offset but limited volume.</strong> Medicare reimburses nursing homes for post-acute skilled nursing care following hospitalization, and these rates typically exceed costs. However, Medicare stays are short-term (average under 30 days) and require clinical documentation justifying skilled care. Rural facilities often have lower Medicare volume than urban counterparts, limiting their ability to offset Medicaid losses with Medicare profits.</p>
<p><strong>Commercial payers are scarce.</strong> Private pay and commercial insurance represent a small share of rural nursing home revenue. The populations that carry commercial insurance or can afford private pay rates are precisely the populations leaving rural areas for metropolitan employment.</p>
<p><strong>The math does not work.</strong> A facility receiving 65% of revenue from Medicaid at 86% of cost, 25% from Medicare at 110% of cost, and 10% from private pay at 120% of cost generates: (0.65 Ãƒâ€” 0.86) + (0.25 Ãƒâ€” 1.10) + (0.10 Ãƒâ€” 1.20) = 0.559 + 0.275 + 0.120 = 0.954, or 95.4% of costs covered. Operating on 4.6% negative margins is unsustainable.</p>
<h3 id="cost-pressures">Cost Pressures<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#cost-pressures">#</a></h3>
<p>While revenues are constrained, costs have escalated dramatically.</p>
<p><strong>Labor costs have surged.</strong> Nursing homes have raised wages significantly since 2020, with some facilities increasing CNA starting wages by 30% or more. These increases were necessary to compete for workers but compress already-thin margins. Nebraska facilities report CNA starting wages of $21 per hour and RN wages of $40 per hour, levels that would have seemed generous five years ago but now barely compete with alternative employment.</p>
<p><strong>Agency staffing is expensive.</strong> When facilities cannot hire permanent staff, they turn to staffing agencies that charge premium rates. Agency staff cost 50-100% more than equivalent permanent employees. A facility relying on agency staffing to meet basic requirements faces structural losses on every shift.</p>
<p><strong>Inflation hit everything.</strong> Food costs, utility costs, insurance costs, and supply costs all increased during the post-pandemic period. Medicaid rate increases, where they occurred, often lagged inflation. The gap between cost increases and reimbursement increases widened.</p>
<p><strong>Capital needs go unmet.</strong> Rural nursing homes often occupy aging buildings requiring renovation or replacement. But facilities operating on negative margins cannot invest in capital improvements. Deferred maintenance accumulates, eventually creating regulatory compliance problems that compound financial stress.</p>
<h3 id="the-result-closure-or-decline">The Result: Closure or Decline<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-result-closure-or-decline">#</a></h3>
<p>Facilities facing these financial dynamics face limited options:</p>
<p><strong>Closure.</strong> The most financially distressed facilities close, displacing residents and eliminating jobs. The 774 closures since February 2020 represent this outcome. Each closure creates a nursing home desert or deepens an existing one.</p>
<p><strong>Admission limitation.</strong> Facilities unable to staff to capacity limit admissions. Forty-six percent of nursing homes currently limit new admissions due to staffing constraints. Fifty-seven percent have waiting lists. Twenty percent have closed units, wings, or floors. Capacity exists on paper but not in reality.</p>
<p><strong>Quality decline.</strong> Facilities operating with minimal staff produce poor quality outcomes. Quality problems generate regulatory citations, low star ratings, and reputational damage. The downward spiral continues.</p>
<p><strong>Ownership transfer.</strong> Some struggling facilities transfer to new operators, often for-profit chains willing to accept lower staffing levels or regional operators seeking geographic expansion. Whether ownership transfer improves or worsens outcomes varies by acquirer.</p>
<h2 id="alternative-perspective-the-provider-as-victim-view">Alternative Perspective: The Provider as Victim View<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#alternative-perspective-the-provider-as-victim-view">#</a></h2>
<p>The nursing home industry argues, with substantial justification, that providers face genuine policy failure. The argument deserves serious engagement:</p>
<p><strong>Medicaid rates are set by government, not providers.</strong> Facilities cannot unilaterally raise rates. When government pays 86 cents per dollar of cost, the resulting losses are government-imposed, not provider-chosen. Demanding better quality from underfunded providers is policy incoherence.</p>
<p><strong>The staffing mandate represented unfunded mandate.</strong> Requiring facilities to hire workers without providing funding to pay workers shifts costs while claiming to improve quality. If government wants specific staffing levels, government should fund specific staffing levels. Otherwise, the mandate simply accelerates closure.</p>
<p><strong>COVID was not providers&rsquo; fault.</strong> The pandemic killed nursing home residents at catastrophic rates, traumatized staff, and imposed massive costs for infection control. Providers did not create the pandemic. Government responses, including some that restricted visitor access and harmed resident wellbeing, were government decisions. Blaming providers for pandemic outcomes ignores context.</p>
<p><strong>Demographic change is structural.</strong> The aging of rural America is not something nursing homes caused or can reverse. The shrinking of rural working-age populations is not something nursing homes caused or can reverse. Demanding that providers solve structural demographic challenges is unrealistic.</p>
<h3 id="assessment">Assessment<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#assessment">#</a></h3>
<p>The provider-as-victim narrative contains substantial truth. Medicaid underfunding is real. Unfunded mandates are real. Pandemic impacts were real. Demographic pressures are real. Providers operate within constraints they did not create and cannot unilaterally change.</p>
<p>However, the narrative is incomplete:</p>
<p><strong>Ownership matters.</strong> For-profit nursing homes extract profits that could fund wages. Related-party transactions transfer revenue to ownership entities. The claim that &ldquo;reimbursement&rdquo; prevents adequate wages sometimes obscures choices about profit extraction.</p>
<p><strong>Variation exists.</strong> Some facilities in identical reimbursement environments perform better than others. Leadership, management, culture, and community relationships explain variation that reimbursement alone cannot. Provider victimhood is context; leadership is variable.</p>
<p><strong>Quality variation precedes closure.</strong> Many closed facilities had quality problems before financial problems. Four of the 17 Iowa facilities that closed in 2022 were in CMS&rsquo;s special focus program or candidates for it, facing extra scrutiny for poor performance. The narrative that good facilities close due to external pressure ignores that struggling facilities often struggled for internal reasons.</p>
<p><strong>The honest assessment:</strong> Long-term care faces genuine policy failure. But policy failure does not excuse facility-level choices that worsen outcomes. Context constrains options; it does not eliminate agency.</p>
<h2 id="case-study-when-good-sam-left-town">Case Study: When Good Sam Left Town<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#case-study-when-good-sam-left-town">#</a></h2>
<p>The City of Mott, North Dakota contains 685 residents. Good Samaritan Society operated a nursing home there for decades, serving elders who had lived their entire lives in the surrounding agricultural community. In 2022, Good Samaritan announced the facility would close. The community formed a working group to develop alternatives.</p>
<p>The community proposed that Sanford Health, Good Samaritan&rsquo;s parent organization, allow use of the facility for senior care under different management. Sanford declined. The facility closed. The building was listed for sale with a stipulation that it cannot be used for rendering health care services of any kind.</p>
<p>Why would a health system prevent a community from providing health services in an existing healthcare facility? The answer likely involves liability concerns, licensing complications, and organizational priorities. Whatever the reason, the result was clear: 32 residents displaced, 30 staff unemployed, and a community permanently denied institutional care for its elders.</p>
<p>Mott residents requiring nursing home care now travel to facilities in other communities. Those without transportation, without family to arrange visits, without resources to bridge distance, face isolation from everything they have known.</p>
<p>The Good Samaritan Society, founded in 1922 by a Lutheran pastor in Arthur, North Dakota, began with the mission of caring for aging members of rural congregations. A century later, the organization bearing that mission withdrew from rural communities because mission could not overcome financial reality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t find staff,&rdquo; explained Good Samaritan&rsquo;s CEO. &ldquo;We had plenty of people to serve, 32 residents, roughly 30 staff members, but we didn&rsquo;t see a sustainable future largely because we didn&rsquo;t have the workforce in place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The workforce problem is real. The solution, withdrawal from rural communities, is also real. Mission alone does not employ nurses.</p>
<h2 id="implications-for-rhtp">Implications for RHTP<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#implications-for-rhtp">#</a></h2>
<p>RHTP addresses rural healthcare transformation but engages long-term care indirectly. The implications of nursing home decline for RHTP goals deserve explicit attention.</p>
<h3 id="hospital-discharge-challenges">Hospital Discharge Challenges<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#hospital-discharge-challenges">#</a></h3>
<p>Nursing homes provide post-acute care for patients discharged from hospitals following acute illness, surgery, or injury. When nursing home beds are unavailable, hospitals cannot discharge patients who no longer require acute care but still require skilled nursing.</p>
<p><strong>The result is ALC (Alternative Level of Care) patients occupying hospital beds.</strong> A 2025 study from the University of Rochester found that reduced nursing home capacity was linked to longer hospital stays, especially extended stays of 28 days or more. Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester routinely has 50-75 admitted patients waiting in overflow spaces for inpatient rooms, partly because nursing home bed shortages prevent discharge.</p>
<p>For RHTP-funded hospitals pursuing efficiency and transformation, nursing home capacity constraints create direct obstacles. Hospitals cannot redesign patient flow when downstream capacity does not exist. Length of stay metrics deteriorate when discharge destinations are unavailable.</p>
<h3 id="aging-in-place-limitations">Aging in Place Limitations<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#aging-in-place-limitations">#</a></h3>
<p>RHTP prioritizes home and community-based care that allows people to age in place rather than entering institutional settings. The policy preference for HCBS over institutional care aligns with resident preferences: 62.5% of rural respondents to the National Health and Aging Trends Study expressed preference to receive care in their own home.</p>
<p>But aging in place has limits. <strong>When care needs exceed what home and community services can provide, institutional care becomes necessary.</strong> Cognitive decline severe enough to require 24-hour supervision, medical complexity requiring continuous skilled nursing, or family caregiver exhaustion beyond respite services can all necessitate nursing home placement.</p>
<p>If nursing home capacity contracts while aging populations grow, the gap creates impossible situations. Individuals who need institutional care cannot access it. Family caregivers facing impossible burdens receive no relief. The preference for aging in place becomes abandonment when alternatives to institutional care are unavailable.</p>
<h3 id="workforce-competition">Workforce Competition<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#workforce-competition">#</a></h3>
<p>RHTP workforce investments target healthcare workers broadly. Loan repayment programs, training pipelines, and recruitment initiatives seek to increase rural healthcare workforce supply. Nursing homes compete for these same workers.</p>
<p><strong>The competition is unequal.</strong> Hospital positions typically offer better wages, more predictable schedules, and higher prestige than nursing home positions. Nursing degrees can lead to hospital employment or nursing home employment; graduates typically prefer hospitals. RHTP workforce investments may increase healthcare worker supply overall while doing little for nursing home staffing specifically.</p>
<p>State RHTP strategies that fund nursing education without addressing nursing home working conditions may inadvertently worsen nursing home recruitment. More nurses choosing hospital employment means more nurses not choosing nursing home employment.</p>
<h3 id="quality-and-accountability">Quality and Accountability<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#quality-and-accountability">#</a></h3>
<p>RHTP emphasizes quality measurement and outcome improvement. CMS tracks nursing home quality through the Five-Star Quality Rating System, combining health inspection results, staffing measures, and quality measures into overall ratings.</p>
<p>Rural nursing homes that cannot staff adequately cannot achieve quality ratings that reflect their communities&rsquo; needs. <strong>The quality measurement system designed to drive improvement instead documents decline.</strong> Facilities receiving two-star ratings for staffing shortage face reputational damage that compounds recruitment challenges.</p>
<p>RHTP accountability frameworks that penalize facilities for quality problems may accelerate closure rather than improvement. If quality metrics reflect workforce constraints beyond facility control, quality-based accountability is measuring the wrong thing.</p>
<h2 id="when-long-term-care-can-transform">When Long-Term Care Can Transform<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#when-long-term-care-can-transform">#</a></h2>
<p>Despite structural challenges, some rural long-term care facilities demonstrate transformation capacity. The conditions enabling transformation merit attention:</p>
<p><strong>Regional scale creates recruitment advantages.</strong> Facilities operated by regional organizations with multiple locations can offer career advancement, training programs, and transfer opportunities that standalone facilities cannot match. Good Samaritan&rsquo;s consolidation to seven Midwestern states reflects this logic: concentration enables investment that dispersion prevents.</p>
<p><strong>State Medicaid adequacy enables sustainability.</strong> States that have increased Medicaid nursing facility rates substantially, like Wyoming (20% increase in 2023) or Montana (33% increase over two years), give facilities financial capacity for competitive wages. States with chronically inadequate Medicaid rates produce chronic facility distress.</p>
<p><strong>Community engagement sustains facilities.</strong> Facilities embedded in community life, supported by local governments, engaged with local employers, and integrated with community institutions demonstrate greater resilience than facilities lacking community connection. Community ownership, whether through nonprofit governance or county operation, creates accountability to residents rather than distant shareholders.</p>
<p><strong>Workforce pipeline investment pays off.</strong> Facilities that invest in CNA training programs, tuition reimbursement, and career ladders from entry-level to professional positions can develop workforce rather than merely recruiting it. Pipeline investment requires financial capacity, but facilities that achieve capacity can build sustainable workforce strategies.</p>
<p><strong>Technology extends workforce capacity.</strong> Telehealth for physician services, remote monitoring for clinical status, and operational technology for documentation and care coordination can extend what limited staff can accomplish. Technology does not replace workers but can make workers more effective.</p>
<h2 id="when-long-term-care-cannot-transform">When Long-Term Care Cannot Transform<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#when-long-term-care-cannot-transform">#</a></h2>
<p>Many rural long-term care facilities lack transformation capacity. Honest assessment requires acknowledging these limitations:</p>
<p><strong>Standalone facilities in shrinking communities face structural decline.</strong> A single nursing home in a community of 700 people with declining population has no recruitment base, no regional support structure, and no path to sustainability. Transformation cannot overcome demographic math.</p>
<p><strong>Facilities dependent on inadequate Medicaid cannot compete for workers.</strong> Without state action on Medicaid rates, facilities receiving 86 cents per dollar of cost cannot pay competitive wages. Transformation requires financial foundation; underfunding eliminates foundation.</p>
<p><strong>Facilities with poor quality histories face reputational barriers.</strong> Facilities in CMS special focus programs, with histories of serious deficiencies, face recruitment challenges beyond normal workforce constraints. Workers choose where to work; they avoid facilities with poor reputations.</p>
<p><strong>Facilities without leadership capacity cannot implement change.</strong> Transformation requires management capacity to redesign operations, implement new models, and sustain change. Facilities struggling to maintain basic operations lack bandwidth for transformation. Survival consumes all attention.</p>
<p><strong>Facilities serving communities without alternatives face closure, not transformation.</strong> When the choice is inadequate care or no care, policy should honestly acknowledge that some communities will lose nursing home access regardless of intervention.</p>
<h2 id="recommendations">Recommendations<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#recommendations">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="for-long-term-care-providers">For Long-Term Care Providers<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#for-long-term-care-providers">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Assess sustainability honestly.</strong> Facilities facing structural challenges should evaluate whether transformation can achieve sustainability or whether managed transition serves communities better. Planned closure with resident transfer beats unplanned collapse.</p>
<p><strong>Pursue regional affiliation.</strong> Standalone facilities facing workforce and financial challenges should explore affiliation with regional organizations that can provide support, resources, and career pathways. Independence that cannot sustain operations is not worth preserving.</p>
<p><strong>Invest in workforce development.</strong> Facilities with financial capacity should develop training pipelines, career advancement structures, and retention programs. Recruiting from a fixed labor pool is zero-sum; developing workers expands the pool.</p>
<p><strong>Engage communities.</strong> Facilities embedded in community life demonstrate greater resilience. Boards with community representation, volunteer programs, family councils, and local partnerships create accountability and support that isolated facilities lack.</p>
<h3 id="for-state-agencies">For State Agencies<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#for-state-agencies">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Prioritize Medicaid rate adequacy.</strong> State Medicaid rates determine nursing home sustainability more than any other policy lever. States with adequate rates have sustainable facilities; states with inadequate rates have closing facilities. The connection is direct.</p>
<p><strong>Assess transformation capacity realistically.</strong> Not all nursing homes can transform. State RHTP strategies should differentiate between facilities that can transform with support, facilities that need stabilization before transformation, and facilities that may close despite intervention.</p>
<p><strong>Coordinate workforce investments.</strong> RHTP workforce funding should explicitly address long-term care alongside acute care. Training programs, loan repayment, and recruitment initiatives should include nursing home positions, not just hospital positions.</p>
<p><strong>Consider alternatives to institutional care.</strong> State HCBS capacity affects nursing home demand. Robust home and community-based services allow some individuals to avoid institutional placement, but only if HCBS infrastructure exists. Developing HCBS while nursing homes close requires careful sequencing.</p>
<h3 id="for-cms">For CMS<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#for-cms">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Accept that long-term care is part of rural health transformation.</strong> RHTP frameworks that ignore nursing homes while funding hospitals address only part of the system. Discharge bottlenecks, workforce competition, and aging-in-place failures all connect to nursing home capacity.</p>
<p><strong>Fund workforce without mandating workforce.</strong> The staffing mandate controversy revealed genuine tension between quality goals and capacity constraints. Funding nursing home workforce development, CNA training, and retention programs could improve staffing without mandating levels that trigger closure.</p>
<p><strong>Acknowledge nursing home deserts as access problem.</strong> CMS tracks hospital closures and healthcare shortage areas. Nursing home deserts receive less systematic attention despite comparable access implications. Surveillance and response systems for nursing home capacity contraction would enable more timely intervention.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>Rural long-term care facilities embody the workforce versus quality tension with particular intensity. They cannot attract workers because they cannot pay competitive wages. They cannot pay competitive wages because Medicaid does not cover costs. They cannot improve quality without adequate staffing. They cannot achieve adequate staffing without financial foundation. <strong>Each element reinforces the others.</strong></p>
<p>RHTP transformation goals cannot succeed if nursing homes disappear. Hospitals cannot discharge patients to facilities that do not exist. Aging-in-place works until it does not, and when institutional care is needed, someone must provide it. Workforce pipelines that ignore long-term care produce workers who avoid long-term care employment.</p>
<p>The evidence suggests that some rural nursing homes can achieve sustainability through regional affiliation, adequate Medicaid rates, workforce development investment, and community engagement. Many cannot. The transformation capacity that policy assumes does not exist uniformly across 15,000 nursing facilities or 3,000+ rural nursing homes.</p>
<p><strong>Honest assessment requires accepting that some communities will lose nursing home access.</strong> The demographic math of shrinking working-age populations serving expanding elderly populations in places that cannot attract workers produces predictable outcomes. Transformation cannot repeal mathematics.</p>
<p>What policy can do is distinguish between facilities that can transform with support and facilities that face structural impossibility. It can fund Medicaid adequately in states willing to act. It can invest in workforce pipelines that include long-term care. It can develop home and community-based alternatives for people who can avoid institutional care. And it can help communities plan for managed transitions when closure becomes inevitable.</p>
<p>The alternative, pretending that all nursing homes can transform if they try harder, serves no one. Rural elders deserve honesty about what transformation can and cannot accomplish in the communities where they live and where they hope to age.</p>
