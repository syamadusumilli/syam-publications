### About This Site

This site hosts two long-form analytical series:

**Rural Health Transformation Project** examines the $50 billion federal Rural Health Transformation Program across all 50 states. The analysis covers federal policy architecture, state implementation strategies, evidence-based interventions, stakeholder ecosystems, special populations, and regional variation. The series asks whether rural health transformation can succeed when federal investment is accompanied by simultaneous Medicaid coverage erosion.

**Medicaid Work Requirements** analyzes the policy, implementation, and population impact of Medicaid work requirement programs across states pursuing these waivers.

Both series prioritize **honest assessment over advocacy**, documenting what evidence supports versus what represents aspirational goals.

### Other Projects

**[Blue Gray Matters](https://bluegraymatters.com)** covers neurodivergent perspectives on technology and society.
