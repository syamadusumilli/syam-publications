The Rural Health Transformation Program confronts a fundamental mismatch between geography and governance. Rural health crises operate at regional scale while policy operates at state scale, creating coordination failures that undermine transformation before it begins. The Mississippi Delta spans eight states, Appalachia crosses thirteen, yet no governance structure exists to coordinate health policy across these regions. **A patient in Texarkana lives simultaneously under Texas and Arkansas regulatory frameworks**, their healthcare fragmented by an invisible line. Alternative architecture models assume coordination capacity that current infrastructure cannot provide: the inverse hub requires specialists serving patients across state lines through telehealth, nomadic professionals need practice authority in multiple jurisdictions, regional service centers demand shared staffing networks. Building interstate infrastructure becomes not a peripheral administrative concern but an enabling condition without which transformation remains theoretical.

The barrier inventory reveals coordination failures across four domains. **Interstate licensure compacts have proliferated without creating unified practice authority**. Forty-two states participate in the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact, yet this merely expedites separate state licenses rather than providing automatic multi-state practice rights. The Nurse Licensure Compact covers forty-three jurisdictions, leaving holdouts including New York, California, and Illinois outside the framework. Psychology, counseling, physical therapy, and social work each operate separate compacts under different rules with different member states. A rural service center employing multi-disciplinary teams must navigate multiple independent compact systems, some of which have not yet begun issuing privileges despite legislative enactment. No unified health workforce compact exists. The holdout states create particular regional problems: any coordination effort must either exclude major population centers or maintain parallel systems for accessing their markets. Opposition comes from predictable sources protecting competitive position and fee revenue, proving that compact participation remains voluntary and reversible rather than providing the stability long-term transformation requires.

Regional governance gaps compound licensure barriers. **No regional health authority exists with meaningful implementation power over healthcare delivery**. The Appalachian Regional Commission has invested $188.6 million in sixty-nine multi-state health projects since 2022, demonstrating coordination value but operating through competitive grants without regulatory authority. The 2025 program evaluation documented that cross-state collaboration enabled knowledge transfer and broader-reach strategies impossible within single states, yet ARC cannot require state participation, align regulations, or create binding coordination mechanisms. The Delta Regional Authority operates health systems development programs across eight states and 252 counties but coordinates rather than governs, unable to mandate that Mississippi and Arkansas align rural hospital policies or require Louisiana and Missouri to coordinate behavioral health systems. Federal regional commissions provide funding and facilitation while lacking authority over the healthcare delivery systems they attempt to coordinate.

Health information exchange remains fragmented across state boundaries, each state developing its own infrastructure with limited interstate connectivity. **A patient receiving care in Kentucky, Tennessee, and West Virginia has records scattered across three state systems with no guaranteed interoperability**. Different state consent requirements, different data formats, different reporting obligations create navigation barriers for both patients and nomadic professionals. The Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement provides a national framework for health information exchange, but participation remains voluntary and implementation uneven. Rural areas needing interstate coordination most acutely often lack technical capacity to participate in sophisticated exchange networks. Prescription drug monitoring operates through state-specific databases with incomplete interstate query capability. Disease surveillance coordinates through CDC rather than direct interstate connection. Quality reporting uses state-specific measures without regional performance benchmarking. Emergency resource tracking proceeds through separate state management systems with limited real-time interstate coordination.

Payment system misalignment fragments regional coordination even when licensure and data barriers fall. **Medicare operates nationally but Medicaid operates state by state**, creating rate variation that leads providers to avoid low-rate states in regional networks. A regional health network serving the Mississippi Delta navigates eight different Medicaid programs with eight different rate structures, eight different prior authorization systems, eight different telehealth policies. Administrative costs of multi-state Medicaid participation can exceed revenue from serving patients in low-rate states, leading networks to avoid those populations entirely. Patients lose coverage when crossing state lines. Value-based contracts operate through state-specific programs unable to span regions. The payment fragmentation means that even when workforce mobility and data sharing become possible, financial incentives still push against regional coordination.

Current reform demonstrates acceleration without adequacy. The Interstate Medical Licensure Compact has processed over 95,000 applications since launch, the Nurse Licensure Compact added Michigan as its forty-fourth member in early 2026, the Psychology Interjurisdictional Compact reached forty-three states by late 2025. The Counseling Compact enacted legislation in thirty-nine states plus DC but requires months or years of database integration and regulatory alignment before providing practical benefit to counselors in enacted states. New compacts continue emerging: social work at twenty-eight states, audiology and speech-language pathology at thirty-six states plus Virgin Islands, school psychology at six states needing seven for activation. **Each new compact addresses one more profession while proliferation creates its own coordination challenge**. The ARISE Initiative demonstrates effective multi-state outcomes impossible within single states, serving over 14,500 people and 3,300 businesses through collaborative projects. The Delta Health Systems Implementation Program provides continuity from planning through execution. Yet these successes remain grant-funded and voluntary rather than creating permanent infrastructure.

Federal agencies encourage but do not require interstate coordination despite possessing unused authority. CMS could condition Medicare participation on interstate data sharing using existing regulatory power already exercised for quality reporting and anti-discrimination policies. HRSA could require regional coordination for rural health grants. HHS could establish binding interstate health corridors. The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation convened expert panels producing detailed recommendations for federal action on licensure barriers, coordination infrastructure grants, compact adoption support, credentialing technology investment. These recommendations remain largely unimplemented. **Federal enabling actions could include practice authority for rural underserved areas paralleling existing authorities for Veterans Administration, Indian Health Service, and military healthcare**, allowing professionals licensed in one state to practice anywhere designated as a Health Professional Shortage Area. This requires Congressional action facing predictable opposition from state medical boards and specialty organizations, but would eliminate interstate barriers where they matter most.

Regional infrastructure investment requires sustained funding beyond current grant programs. Connecting state health information exchanges within regions costs $50-100 million per region. Multi-state workforce coordination centers providing unified credentialing and placement cost $20-30 million per region. Regional emergency health response networks for coordinated crisis response cost $30-50 million per region. Interstate care coordination platforms for shared management of multi-state patients cost $40-60 million per region. ARISE demonstrates coordination value but operates through competitive grants with uncertain renewal. **Permanent regional health authorities with dedicated funding would provide stability that long-term transformation requires** rather than dependence on appropriation cycles that create start-stop investment patterns.

Stakeholder analysis reveals interests shaping political feasibility. State medical boards maintain licensing authority and fee revenue through opposition to federal practice authority and caution on compact enhancement. Board members often include physicians with competitive interests in limiting workforce supply. Board revenue depends on licensing fees that compacts may reduce. State nursing associations protect state-specific standards with mixed positions on the Nurse Licensure Compact, some actively opposing. Rural health systems seeking workforce access from broader geography strongly support interstate coordination but individual systems lack political power compared to state-level stakeholders. Health IT vendors face conflicting incentives: fragmentation creates market opportunities as each state represents a separate sale, but genuine interoperability would expand total market by enabling regional health systems currently unable to exist. State governors demonstrate state-level achievement with limited incentive for regional credit-sharing that requires sharing political returns from coordination investment.

The Southeastern Corridor Initiative provides implementation evidence from the Lower Tombigbee River Valley spanning Alabama-Mississippi. Choctaw County, Alabama had no hospital, its 12,000 residents driving 35 miles to Meridian, Mississippi or 45 miles to Demopolis, Alabama for emergency care. Noxubee County, Mississippi operated a 25-bed hospital perpetually on closure's edge. Both counties applied separately for RHTP funding, both rejected for insufficient scale. Joint application faced initial resistance from state health agencies seeing cross-state coordination as distraction from in-state priorities and liability exposure risk. **Federal pressure combined with regional advocacy changed dynamics**: HRSA's Fiscal Year 2028 guidance explicitly prioritized interstate coordination in persistent poverty counties, Delta Regional Authority offered supplemental funding for cross-state projects. The corridor now operates a shared health system serving 22,000 people across the state line through a single federally qualified health center running clinics in both counties, the former Noxubee hospital converted to rural emergency hospital and rehabilitation center with Alabama patients comprising 40 percent of volume.

Infrastructure investment preceded demand in the corridor model. Federal grants funded health information exchange bridges connecting Alabama and Mississippi systems. State Medicaid agencies negotiated reciprocity agreements allowing patients to access corridor services regardless of which state issued coverage. The Counseling Compact and Interstate Medical Licensure Compact enabled workforce deployment that would have been administratively impossible under separate state licensing. Dr. Patricia Coleman's administrative burden reduced by two-thirds through unified credentialing rather than maintaining separate licenses, malpractice coverage, and credentialing in each state. Lessons for replication include that federal
