Rural health challenges do not respect state lines. The **Mississippi Delta spans eight states**. Appalachia crosses thirteen. The Great Plains stretch from Texas to the Canadian border through a dozen jurisdictions. A patient in Texarkana lives simultaneously under Texas and Arkansas regulatory frameworks. A tribal nation's health service area may cross three state boundaries. Yet health policy is organized around states, creating governance structures that fragment problems requiring regional solutions.

Alternative architecture assumes coordination that **current infrastructure cannot provide**. The inverse hub model requires specialists to serve patients across state lines through telehealth. The nomadic professional model requires practitioners to rotate through communities in multiple states. Regional service centers require shared staffing and coordinated referral networks. AI and robotic systems require consistent governance across the regions they serve.

Building interstate infrastructure is an enabling condition that individual state action cannot achieve. **Federal authority must enable**, regional institutions must coordinate, and states must cede some autonomy for regional benefit. The political economy of interstate coordination rewards cooperation in theory while punishing it in practice: governors get credit for state-level wins, not regional outcomes; legislators answer to state constituents, not regional populations; agencies operate within state budgets and state priorities. Overcoming these structural incentives requires deliberate infrastructure investment that creates new coordination pathways.

## The Barrier Inventory

Interstate coordination barriers span four domains: workforce mobility, regional governance, data infrastructure, and payment alignment. Each domain presents distinct challenges requiring different solutions.

### Workforce Mobility Barriers

**Interstate licensure compacts** have expanded dramatically, yet fundamental barriers remain. The landscape includes multiple profession-specific compacts operating under different rules.

| Compact | Member States | Limitation |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| Interstate Medical Licensure (IMLC) | 42 states + DC, Guam | Expedited separate licenses, not automatic authority |
| Nurse Licensure (NLC) | 43 jurisdictions | Multistate license, but 8 holdout states |
| Psychology (PSYPACT) | 43 states | Telepsychology focus, temporary in-person limits |
| Counseling Compact | 39 states + DC | Not yet issuing privileges (expected 2025) |
| Physical Therapy Compact | 37 states | Strong model, limited to one profession |
| Social Work Compact | 28 states | Early implementation stage |

Each compact operates independently with its own governance structure, fee schedule, and participation rules. **No unified health workforce compact** enables a multi-disciplinary team to practice across state lines under a single framework. A rural service center employing physicians, nurses, behavioral health specialists, and rehabilitation professionals must navigate multiple separate compact systems with different member states.

The **holdout states** create particular problems for regional coordination. New York, California, and Illinois have not joined the Nurse Licensure Compact. California and New York remain outside the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact. These states represent significant populations and healthcare markets, meaning regional coordination must either exclude them or maintain parallel systems for accessing their markets.

Opposition to compacts comes from **predictable sources**: state nursing associations concerned about lowered standards, physician organizations protecting competitive position, licensing boards protecting fee revenue and regulatory authority. But the opposition proves that compact participation remains voluntary and reversible, undermining the infrastructure stability that long-term transformation requires.

### Regional Governance Gaps

**No regional health governance authority** exists with meaningful implementation power. Federal regional commissions provide funding and coordination but lack regulatory authority over healthcare delivery.

| Regional Authority | Coverage | Health Activities | Limitation |
|-------------------|----------|------------------|------------|
| Appalachian Regional Commission | 13 states, 423 counties | ARISE Initiative, workforce development | No regulatory authority |
| Delta Regional Authority | 8 states, 252 counties | DRCHSD Program, health IT loans | Advisory role only |
| Denali Commission | Alaska | Health facility construction | Single state focus |
| Northern Border Regional Commission | 4 states | Limited health focus | Minimal health infrastructure |

The **Appalachian Regional Commission** represents the most developed regional health infrastructure. Since 2022, ARC has invested $188.6 million in 69 ARISE projects across all 13 Appalachian states. The 2025 program evaluation reported multi-state impact as a "significant strength," with grantees noting that cross-state collaboration facilitated knowledge transfer and built strategies with broader reach than single-state efforts. Yet ARISE remains a grant program, not a governance structure. It cannot require state participation, align state regulations, or create binding coordination mechanisms.

The **Delta Regional Authority** operates the Delta Region Community Health Systems Development Program in partnership with HRSA. Since 2017, 68 healthcare organizations have participated in technical assistance covering financial sustainability, quality improvement, and workforce development. But DRA coordinates rather than governs. It cannot mandate that Mississippi and Arkansas align their rural hospital policies or require Louisiana and Missouri to coordinate behavioral health crisis systems.

### Data Infrastructure Fragmentation

**Health information exchange** remains fragmented across state boundaries. Each state has developed its own HIE infrastructure with limited interstate connectivity.

| Data Type | Interstate Challenge | Coordination Gap |
|-----------|---------------------|------------------|
| Electronic health records | Different state consent requirements | No uniform interstate data sharing framework |
| Prescription drug monitoring | State-specific databases | Incomplete interstate query capability |
| Disease surveillance | State public health systems | Coordination through CDC, not direct interstate |
| Quality reporting | State-specific measures | No regional performance benchmarking |
| Resource tracking | State emergency management | Limited real-time interstate coordination |

A patient who lives in Kentucky but receives care in Tennessee and West Virginia has **records scattered across three state systems** with no guaranteed interoperability. A nomadic professional serving communities in multiple states must navigate different consent requirements, different data formats, and different reporting obligations.

The **Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement (TEFCA)** launched by ONC provides a national framework for health information exchange, but participation remains voluntary and implementation uneven. Rural areas, which most need interstate coordination, often lack the technical capacity to participate in sophisticated exchange networks.

### Payment System Misalignment

**Medicare operates nationally** but **Medicaid operates state by state**, creating payment misalignment that fragments regional coordination.

| Payment Issue | Interstate Effect |
|---------------|------------------|
| Medicaid rate variation | Providers avoid low-rate states in regional networks |
| Enrollment portability | Patients lose coverage when crossing state lines |
| Prior authorization | Different requirements per state Medicaid program |
| Telehealth payment | State-specific policies, no regional alignment |
| Value-based contracts | State-specific programs cannot span regions |

A regional health network serving the Mississippi Delta must navigate eight different Medicaid programs with eight different rate structures, eight different prior authorization systems, and eight different telehealth policies. Administrative costs of multi-state Medicaid participation can exceed the revenue from serving patients in low-rate states, leading networks to avoid those populations entirely.

## Current Reform Landscape

Progress on interstate coordination has accelerated but remains insufficient for alternative architecture requirements.

### Compact Expansion

Interstate licensure compacts continue expanding. The **IMLC has processed over 95,000 applications** since launch, with the percentage of expedited licenses approved increasing yearly. The Nurse Licensure Compact added jurisdictions through 2025, with Michigan advancing legislation in early 2026 to become the 44th member. The Psychology Interjurisdictional Compact reached 43 states by late 2025, providing the most comprehensive interstate practice framework for behavioral health.

The **Counseling Compact** illustrates both promise and limitation. With 39 states plus DC having enacted legislation, the compact was expected to begin issuing privileges in late 2025. But implementation requires database integration and regulatory alignment that takes time even after legislative enactment. Counselors in enacted states must wait months or years before the compact provides practical benefit.

New compacts continue emerging. The **Social Work Licensure Compact** reached 28 member states by 2025. The **Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology Compact** includes 36 states plus the Virgin Islands. A **School Psychology Compact** launched with six states, needing seven for activation. Each new compact addresses one more profession, but the proliferation of separate compacts creates its own coordination challenge.

### Regional Health Initiatives

The **ARISE Initiative** demonstrates effective multi-state health coordination. ARC's 2025 evaluation documented that cross-state collaboration produced outcomes impossible within single states: shared workforce training programs, coordinated care pathways, regional health IT infrastructure. Grantees reported serving over 14,500 people and 3,300 businesses through collaborative projects.

HRSA's **Delta Health Systems Implementation Program** represents another coordination model. The program provides implementation funding to organizations that received technical assistance through the Delta Region Community Health Systems Development Program, creating continuity from planning through execution. But participation remains voluntary and funding time-limited.

### Federal Coordination Gaps

Federal agencies **encourage** but do not **require** interstate coordination. CMS could condition Medicare participation on interstate data sharing. HRSA could require regional coordination for rural health grants. HHS could establish binding interstate health corridors. None of these authorities have been exercised.

The **Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation** convened expert panels on interstate licensure barriers, producing detailed recommendations for federal action: grants for coordination infrastructure, support for compact adoption, technology investment for credentialing systems. These recommendations remain largely unimplemented.

## The Enabling Change

Building interstate infrastructure requires action at federal, regional, and state levels.

### Federal Enabling Actions

| Action | Authority | Effect |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Condition Medicare participation on interstate data sharing | CMS regulatory authority | Universal health information exchange |
| Establish interstate health corridors with enhanced funding | Congressional appropriation | Incentivize regional coordination |
| Require RHTP spending alignment across states | HRSA grant conditions | Coordinated transformation investment |
| Create federal practice authority for rural underserved areas | Congressional legislation | Bypass state licensure barriers |
| Fund unified health workforce compact development | Congressional appropriation | Replace profession-specific fragmentation |

**Federal practice authority** for rural underserved areas would parallel existing authorities for Veterans Administration, Indian Health Service, and military healthcare. Professionals licensed in one state could practice anywhere designated as a Health Professional Shortage Area, eliminating interstate barriers where they matter most. This authority requires Congressional action but faces predictable opposition from state medical boards and specialty organizations.

**Conditioning Medicare participation** on interstate coordination uses existing regulatory authority. CMS already conditions participation on quality reporting, anti-discrimination policies, and data standards. Adding interstate data sharing requirements would create powerful incentive for coordination without requiring new legislation.

### Regional Infrastructure Investment

| Investment | Purpose | Cost Estimate |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| Regional health information exchange bridges | Connect state HIEs within regions | $50-100M per region |
| Multi-state workforce coordination centers | Unified credentialing and placement | $20-30M per region |
| Regional emergency health response networks | Coordinated crisis response | $30-50M per region |
| Interstate care coordination platforms | Shared care management for multi-state patients | $40-60M per region |

Regional infrastructure requires **sustained funding** beyond current grant programs. ARISE demonstrates what multi-state coordination can accomplish but operates through competitive grants with uncertain renewal. Permanent regional health authorities with dedicated funding would provide the stability that long-term transformation requires.

### State Compact Optimization

States should pursue **comprehensive compact participation** rather than selective adoption.

| State Category | Priority Action |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Non-compact holdouts (NY, CA, IL for NLC) | Legislative campaign for compact adoption |
| Partial participants | Complete participation across all health professions |
| Full participants | Advocate for compact enhancement and unification |

**Compact enhancement** matters as much as expansion. Current compacts provide expedited licensing or practice privileges, but none create the seamless practice authority that nomadic professionals need. A unified health workforce compact with automatic practice authority across all member states would transform interstate practice more than incremental expansion of separate profession-specific compacts.

## Stakeholder Analysis

Interstate coordination creates winners and losers whose interests shape political feasibility.

| Stakeholder | Interest | Position |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| State medical boards | Maintain licensing authority and fee revenue | Oppose federal practice authority, cautious on compact enhancement |
| State nursing associations | Protect state-specific standards | Mixed on NLC, some actively oppose |
| Rural health systems | Access workforce from broader geography | Strong support for interstate coordination |
| Specialty societies | Protect scope and competitive position | Selective support based on competitive dynamics |
| Health IT vendors | Sell to fragmented state markets | Mixed incentives on interoperability |
| State governors | Demonstrate state-level achievement | Limited incentive for regional credit-sharing |
| Regional commissions | Expand coordination role | Strong support but limited authority |

**State medical boards** represent the most consistent opposition to interstate coordination that reduces their authority. Board members often include physicians with competitive interests in limiting workforce supply. Board revenue depends on licensing fees that compacts may reduce. The Federation of State Medical Boards provides coordination among boards but has institutional interest in preserving state-level authority.

**Rural health systems** are natural advocates for interstate coordination. They struggle to recruit from limited state-specific pools and would benefit from access to regional or national labor markets. But individual rural systems have limited political power compared to state-level stakeholders.

**Health IT vendors** face conflicting incentives. Fragmentation creates market opportunities, as each state represents a separate sale. But vendors also recognize that genuine interoperability would expand the total market by enabling regional health systems that currently cannot exist. Large vendors increasingly support national standards while protecting proprietary advantages.

## Implementation Pathway

Interstate infrastructure development requires **phased approach** building from current momentum.

**Phase 1 (2026-2027): Compact Completion**
- Campaign for NLC adoption in remaining holdout states
- Complete Counseling Compact implementation
- Accelerate Social Work Compact activation
- Develop unified health workforce compact proposal

**Phase 2 (2027-2028): Regional Infrastructure**
- Establish regional health coordination authorities in Appalachia and Delta
- Deploy interstate health information exchange bridges
- Create multi-state workforce coordination centers
- Launch regional care coordination platforms

**Phase 3 (2028-2030): Federal Enablement**
- Enact federal practice authority for rural underserved areas
- Condition Medicare participation on interstate data sharing
- Establish permanent regional health authority funding
- Implement interstate health corridors with enhanced RHTP alignment

The pathway assumes **political conditions** that may not materialize. Federal practice authority faces organized opposition from state medical boards and physician organizations. Medicare conditioning faces industry resistance. Regional authority funding faces Congressional appropriation challenges. Each step requires coalition building and political momentum that cannot be guaranteed.

## The Southeastern Corridor Initiative

*Lower Tombigbee River Valley, Alabama-Mississippi Border, 2029*

The counties look identical from the highway: pine forests, catfish ponds, chicken houses, small towns with empty storefronts. But the invisible line between Alabama and Mississippi created **two separate healthcare systems** serving the same population.

Choctaw County, Alabama had no hospital. Its 12,000 residents drove 35 miles to Meridian, Mississippi for emergency care, or 45 miles to Demopolis, Alabama. Noxubee County, Mississippi had a 25-bed hospital perpetually on the edge of closure, serving a population of 10,000 with aging physicians who had no succession plan.

The **Southeastern Health Corridor Initiative** emerged from desperation. Both counties' health councils had applied separately for RHTP funding, both been rejected for insufficient scale. A regional economic development officer suggested joint application. The state health agencies initially resisted: Mississippi's lead agency saw Alabama coordination as distraction from in-state priorities; Alabama's agency worried about liability exposure from cross-state arrangements.

What changed was **federal pressure combined with regional advocacy**. HRSA's Fiscal Year 2028 guidance explicitly prioritized "interstate coordination in persistent poverty counties." The Delta Regional Authority offered supplemental funding for cross-state projects. The Appalachian Regional Commission, whose territory included neither county, shared lessons from ARISE about multi-state collaboration.

The corridor now operates a **shared health system** serving 22,000 people across the state line. A single federally qualified health center runs clinics in both counties under a governance structure that includes representatives from both states. The former Noxubee hospital converted to a rural emergency hospital and rehabilitation center, with Alabama patients comprising 40% of volume. Behavioral health services operate from a single center in Mississippi that employs Alabama-licensed counselors under the Counseling Compact.

Dr. Patricia Coleman rotates between sites weekly. **"Before the corridor, I had to maintain separate licenses, separate malpractice coverage, separate credentialing."** The unified system reduced her administrative burden by two-thirds. Her patients no longer face coverage gaps when they cross the state line for specialty appointments in Meridian.

The corridor works because **infrastructure investment preceded demand**. Federal grants funded the health information exchange bridge connecting Alabama and Mississippi systems. State Medicaid agencies negotiated a reciprocity agreement allowing patients to access corridor services regardless of which state issued their coverage. The Counseling Compact and IMLC enabled workforce deployment that would have been administratively impossible under separate state licensing.

Lessons emerged for replication. First, **federal pressure matters**: without HRSA's interstate priority and DRA's supplemental funding, state agencies would not have invested coordination effort. Second, **governance complexity requires dedicated resources**: the corridor employs a full-time executive director whose sole job is navigating interstate arrangements. Third, **community ownership sustains political support**: both counties' residents view the corridor as their system, reducing the political risk of interstate arrangements for state officials.

The corridor has not solved all problems. Alabama and Mississippi Medicaid rates differ substantially, creating financial tension in the shared system. State regulatory changes require coordination that bureaucracies resist. Political leadership turnover in either state could disrupt arrangements that depend on gubernatorial support.

But for Dorothy Wilson in Choctaw County, these abstractions matter less than the outcome. **Her cardiologist appointment is now 15 miles away, not 45.** Her medications come from a pharmacy that coordinates with providers in both states. Her behavioral health counselor sees her in the same building where she gets her blood pressure checked. The infrastructure that made this possible took three years to build. It should not take that long again.

## Conclusion

Interstate infrastructure requires **deliberate construction** that current institutions cannot provide. States optimize for state-level outcomes. Federal agencies encourage but do not require coordination. Regional commissions coordinate but do not govern. The governance gap leaves rural communities with fragmented health systems that reflect political boundaries rather than population needs.

Building the infrastructure requires federal action that exercises dormant authority: conditioning Medicare on interstate data sharing, establishing federal practice authority for underserved areas, creating permanent regional health coordination funding. It requires state action that accepts reduced autonomy for regional benefit: comprehensive compact participation, reciprocity agreements, shared governance structures.

**The alternative is continued fragmentation**. A patient in the Mississippi Delta will navigate eight different state systems. A professional serving Appalachian communities will maintain licenses in a dozen states. Regional health networks that could serve multi-state populations will not form because the infrastructure cost exceeds any single organization's capacity.

Series 14's alternative architecture assumes coordination that current infrastructure cannot provide. The inverse hub requires seamless interstate practice authority. The nomadic professional model requires multi-state credentialing infrastructure. Regional service centers require cross-state governance. Without interstate infrastructure, these alternatives remain theoretical possibilities rather than practical options.

The stakes are measured in **lives lost to fragmentation**. Every year that interstate coordination remains aspirational is another year that regional health systems cannot form, that workforce cannot flow to need, that patients face coverage gaps at state boundaries. The infrastructure investment required is substantial: hundreds of millions for regional coordination systems, years of policy development for compact unification, sustained political effort to overcome state-level interests.

But the alternative is permanent fragmentation of problems that require regional solutions.
