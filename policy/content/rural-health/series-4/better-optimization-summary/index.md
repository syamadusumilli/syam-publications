Rosa Medina will bring groceries from her own kitchen on Thursday because the navigation system generates referrals to a food bank 72 miles away that Maria Gonzalez cannot reach in a county with no public transit. This pattern repeats across rural health transformation efforts: programs designed for resource-rich environments deployed where resources fundamentally do not exist, creating activity without impact, documentation without resolution, referrals without services. With five years and $50 billion through the Rural Health Transformation Program, most states will pursue optimization strategies within existing systems, recruiting providers and deploying telehealth and building infrastructure. The question is not whether these conventional approaches should be pursued but whether states will pursue them competently enough to generate real benefit from limited resources.

State applications cluster around predictable transformation approaches. Workforce recruitment and retention programs appear in virtually every application. Telehealth expansion is universal. Community health worker deployment has become standard. Hub-and-spoke network development anchors regional strategies, while payment model experimentation promises sustainability and social needs screening addresses determinants literature. These approaches address real problems with evidence-supported interventions, yet recurring failure patterns undermine their effectiveness. Navigation infrastructure assumes destinations exist, but **coordination systems that connect people to nonexistent services produce documentation without impact**. Recruitment without retention creates treadmills where signing bonuses attract providers who leave within three years due to practice conditions that remain unaddressed. Long-cycle workforce investments face timeline mathematics that cannot work: RHTP ends in 2030, but physician training started in 2025 produces practitioners in 2036. Capital without operations builds facilities that close when grant funding ends, creating stranded assets rather than sustained capacity. Technology without connectivity deploys telehealth equipment where broadband does not reach, inflating transformation claims without delivering transformation benefits. Complexity beyond capacity overwhelms rural organizations lacking the administrative infrastructure that sophisticated programs require. **The pattern is clear: optimization goes wrong when programs assume resources, capabilities, and infrastructure that rural settings do not possess.**

Ten principles offer guidance for better optimization within these constraints. First, build destinations before navigation. Care coordinators and referral platforms create value only when services actually exist within accessible distance. States should audit service availability before investing in navigation infrastructure, expand service capacity alongside or before navigation capacity, and use navigation data to identify gaps that then get filled rather than merely documented. **The referral is not the point; the service is the point.** Successful referral completion rates matter more than referral volume, and resolution of identified needs matters more than documentation of identified needs. Second, maintain retention investment at 2:1 over recruitment. Every dollar spent recruiting a provider who leaves in three years could have retained a provider for ten years at lower total cost. Root causes of rural provider departure are well documented: spouse employment challenges, educational limitations forcing families to leave, professional isolation, administrative burden, and burnout from coverage gaps. Retention investment addresses these causes through spouse employment programs, educational partnerships, peer networks, practice support, and coverage arrangements that enable actual time off. For every dollar spent on recruitment bonuses, spending two on retention infrastructure reflects the economics of provider stability.

Third, match workforce cycle to program cycle. Community health workers deploy within months and offer the fastest workforce returns for RHTP-timeline impact. Medical assistants and nursing assistants require one to two years. Nurses require two to four years depending on pathway. Advanced practice providers require two to four years beyond nursing preparation. Use longer-cycle investments like medical school partnerships and residency program expansion only with clear sustainability planning, because **long-cycle investments without sustainability plans are grants to organizations that may not exist when the workforce arrives**. Fourth, prioritize scope expansion before supply expansion. The workforce shortage cannot be solved through supply expansion alone; training pipelines cannot produce the 20,000-plus additional primary care providers that rural America needs within any reasonable timeframe. Full practice authority for nurse practitioners eliminates supervisory overhead, expanded pharmacist scope enables chronic disease management and care delivery that reduces physician burden, and standing orders and protocols extend physician coverage through nursing staff and medical assistants addressing routine needs. Competency-based training builds workforce capability faster than credential-based hiring.

Fifth, ensure operations before capital. RHTP can fund construction and equipment but cannot guarantee that what gets built remains operational. **Capital investment creates assets, but operational sustainability keeps assets functioning.** Demonstrate operational viability before capital investment through identified patients, committed payers, and operational budgets that balance without grant support. Require staffing plans with identified candidates rather than projected positions. Fund operations reserves alongside capital projects to sustain clinics through their first years until revenue stabilizes. Prioritize renovation and equipment over new construction, and right-size facilities to sustainable service volume rather than projected demand. Sixth, deploy broadband first and telehealth second. Video consultations require bandwidth that many rural connections cannot support. **Telehealth deployment should follow broadband deployment, not precede it.** Assess actual available bandwidth before deploying telehealth solutions, coordinate with broadband expansion initiatives, and design telehealth for actual bandwidth available rather than ideal conditions. Do not count telehealth capacity that residents cannot access; capacity should be measured from the patient perspective, not the provider perspective.

Seventh, build hub-and-spoke networks that extend rather than extract. Regional networks promise to extend specialized services from well-resourced hubs to underserved spokes, but in practice often consolidate services at hubs, leaving spokes with less capacity than before. **The test of a regional network is spoke capacity, not hub activity.** Hub specialists should travel to spokes for routine services, telemedicine should extend hub expertise to spoke locations rather than replace spoke services, and referral relationships should include explicit return pathways that send patients back to community care for ongoing management. Measure spoke capacity before and after network formation; if spoke communities have less access to services after joining a network than before, the network has failed its stated purpose. Eighth, choose payment simplicity over payment innovation. Value-based payment models require data infrastructure, quality reporting capability, risk management capacity, and administrative sophistication that many rural organizations lack. **Rural providers struggling to stay open cannot simultaneously transform their payment models.** Start with simplified fee-for-service enhancement rather than full capitation, provide administrative support alongside payment innovation, and phase complexity gradually with demonstrated capacity.

Ninth, scale investment to evidence quality. Strong evidence from multiple randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews supports full-scale deployment. Moderate evidence from observational studies and limited trials supports expanded pilots. Limited evidence from theory-based approaches and single studies supports demonstration projects with evaluation requirements. **Large investments in unproven interventions are bets, not strategies.** Pilot unproven approaches before system-wide deployment, build evaluation into program design from the start, and require outcome data for continued funding. Tenth, treat sustainability as a design requirement, not an afterthought. RHTP provides five years of transformation funding, but year six arrives regardless of transformation progress. **Transformation that depends on transformation funding is not transformation; it is a temporary program.** Require sustainability plans identifying specific revenue sources before approving any RHTP investment. Build toward sustainable scale rather than maximum scale, prioritize approaches with clear sustainability pathways, and accept that some worthy programs without sustainable financing models should not be started rather than creating dependencies that will inevitably collapse.

These optimization principles can slow rural health infrastructure decline, extend the functional lifespan of existing institutions, improve efficiency and reach of current models, build workforce stability in some communities, and create pockets of excellence that demonstrate possibility. What optimization cannot achieve is equally important to acknowledge. Optimization will not solve the fundamental workforce supply problem; the national healthcare workforce cannot be distributed to cover rural America through any optimization strategy because training pipelines are too slow, competition from urban systems is too intense, and practice economics are too unfavorable. Optimization cannot make current models economically viable in low-density settings, because **healthcare delivery models designed for population density do not work in sparse populations regardless of management quality**. Fee-for-service payment requires volume that does not exist, and facility-based care requires utilization that small populations cannot generate. Optimization cannot address the Medicaid funding cliff; RHTP provides $50 billion over five years for transformation while proposed Medicaid changes would cut hundreds of billions over the same period, and the math does not work. Optimization cannot transform communities from service recipients to health producers, and it cannot build the generational capacity rural health requires through workforce development, educational infrastructure, and community ownership.

The core tension is whether better optimization merely delays inevitable decline or buys time that enables something more fundamental. States pursuing transformation within existing systems can optimize competently or incompetently, and competent optimization produces more benefit from limited resources, buys more time for communities in decline, and creates conditions where paradigm shifts might eventually become possible. Rosa will continue bringing groceries from her own kitchen, and optimization principles will not solve the Presidio County food access problem. But elsewhere, these principles may prevent navigation systems from generating referrals to services that do not exist, may keep providers in communities longer through retention investment, may match workforce strategies to program timelines, may ensure that capital projects have operations to sustain them, and may build hub-and-spoke networks that actually extend services rather than extract volume. The question the companion document leaves unresolved is whether optimization is sufficient or merely necessary: whether doing current approaches well represents the realistic ceiling
