Rosa Medina closes her laptop after generating three referrals for Maria Gonzalez in Presidio County, Texas, where the nearest food bank sits 72 miles away and public transit does not exist. On Thursday, Rosa will bring groceries from her own kitchen, as she has for three years, because this is what the job actually requires when the navigation model assumes resources that do not exist. The referrals remain technically active in the system, practically meaningless, illustrating a pattern that emerges across twelve transformation domains examined in Series 4: **interventions with the strongest evidence require infrastructure that rural communities lack, while interventions feasible in sparse populations often lack rigorous evaluation**. States proposing to spend $50 billion through the Rural Health Transformation Program are operating partially on evidence, partially on theory, and partially on faith.

The evidence landscape reveals more nuance than either advocates or skeptics typically acknowledge. Strong evidence exists for several interventions. Telestroke networks demonstrate large mortality reductions in rural settings. Perinatal regionalization saves lives when high-risk pregnancies reach appropriate facilities. Midwifery-led care improves outcomes for low-risk pregnancies. Community health worker programs show moderate effects on chronic disease management and cancer screening. Loan repayment successfully recruits providers to rural areas. However, evidence quality degrades along predictable dimensions. Strong evidence appears for interventions with discrete, measurable outcomes like mortality reduction from stroke care or placement rates from loan repayment. Evidence weakens for interventions requiring sustained behavior change, system coordination, or long-term follow-up. The interventions that transformation rhetoric most emphasizes (systemic redesign, culture change, integrated care) have the thinnest evaluation support. Rural-specific evidence remains scarce across nearly every domain, with most studies occurring in urban or mixed settings where rural subgroup analyses, when reported, often show attenuated effects.

Five core findings structure the evidence synthesis. First, **the navigation model fails without destinations**. Community health workers, social care screening, and social determinants of health integration all assume that identifying needs and generating referrals produces value. In urban settings with dense service networks, navigation creates connections that improve outcomes. In rural settings where services do not exist, navigation documents unmet need without addressing it. Rosa's referrals remain technically active because the system does not distinguish between referral and resolution. Second, **workforce constraints bind every other transformation**. Telehealth requires someone on each end of the connection. Community paramedicine requires trained paramedics. Hub-and-spoke networks require hub capacity. Community health worker programs require supervision infrastructure. Even interventions designed to extend workforce reach ultimately depend on workforce presence. States cannot transform what they cannot staff. Third, evidence strength inversely correlates with implementation complexity. Interventions with strong evidence typically involve discrete deployments like a program, a technology, or a payment. Interventions requiring systemic coordination, culture change, or infrastructure development show weaker evidence precisely because they are harder to implement, evaluate, and attribute. The transformation that would matter most for rural health (fundamental restructuring of care delivery, financing, and workforce distribution) is the transformation with least evidentiary support.

Fourth, timing mismatches undermine strategy. RHTP requires states to obligate funds within two years and demonstrate transformation by 2030. Physician pipeline investments require 11 to 14 years to produce practitioners. Rural residency expansion initiated in 2025 produces no meaningful supply increase until the 2030s. Community health workers can deploy in months, but physicians cannot. States emphasizing long-cycle investments in RHTP applications are investing in outcomes they will not see within the program period. Fifth, infrastructure investments without operational funding create stranded assets. RHTP can purchase telehealth equipment, build broadband networks, and construct facilities, but RHTP cannot fund ongoing operations. Technology deployed without maintenance budgets degrades. Facilities opened without sustainable revenue streams close. The question is not what RHTP builds but what survives when RHTP ends.

Three interpretive frameworks examine this evidence from different perspectives, each illuminating aspects the others obscure. The evidence-based practice perspective evaluates transformation approaches based on rigorous evidence hierarchies, prioritizing randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and demonstrated effect sizes. This framework argues that RHTP investments should align with evidence strength, that states should prioritize telebehavioral health (strong evidence, low implementation difficulty) over social care integration (limited evidence, high implementation difficulty). It emphasizes that the evidence-practice gap is addressable through properly scaled implementation of what we know works. The limitation of this framework lies in its assumption that evidence from controlled settings transfers to resource-poor contexts, and it privileges interventions amenable to randomization over systemic changes that cannot be randomized.

The implementation science perspective emphasizes that evidence-based interventions routinely fail in practice due to implementation challenges. **Context determines outcomes more than intervention design**. Community paramedicine shows promising evidence in Nova Scotia and Oregon, but whether it produces similar results in West Virginia depends on factors the studies cannot capture: EMS system organization, Medicaid policy, hospital relationships, workforce stability. Implementation difficulty correlates with failure risk, meaning high-complexity interventions (payment reform, regional networks, infrastructure development) fail more often than low-complexity interventions (loan repayment, telehealth deployment) regardless of evidence strength. This framework argues that adaptation is not failure, that evidence-based models require modification for rural contexts, and that insisting on fidelity to protocols developed in resource-rich settings prevents the adaptation rural settings require. Its limitation is that it can excuse failure by attributing poor outcomes to context rather than intervention design, potentially discouraging ambitious transformation in favor of incremental improvements.

The structural reform perspective argues that transformation approaches address symptoms rather than causes. Rural health crisis results from structural failures in healthcare financing, workforce policy, and community economic development. **The Medicaid math remains determinative**: RHTP provides $50 billion over five years for transformation while the Congressional Budget Office estimates $911 billion in Medicaid cuts over the same period. States lose more in coverage than they gain in transformation funding. Hospitals close because the mathematics of rural care do not work, not because hospitals lack transformation programs. This framework emphasizes that workforce maldistribution is a policy choice, with graduate medical education funding flowing to urban academic medical centers and practice incentives favoring specialty care over primary care and urban settings over rural. It argues that coverage expansion would accomplish more than transformation programs, noting that if the 2.2 million people in the Medicaid coverage gap gained coverage, rural providers would gain patients and revenue, hospital margins would improve, and closure pressure would ease. The limitation of this framework is that it can produce paralysis by insisting on structural reform that will not happen, dismissing incremental improvements that provide real value to real people.

Where the three frameworks converge reveals what any adequate assessment must include. All three agree that **the rural evidence base cannot support confident allocation of $50 billion**. The evidence-based practice perspective identifies gaps requiring research. The implementation science perspective notes that evidence from one context provides limited guidance elsewhere. The structural reform perspective observes that evidence for interventions operating within broken systems tells us little about what would work in repaired systems. This convergence does not counsel paralysis but humility: states should acknowledge uncertainty, build evaluation into implementation, and avoid claiming confidence that evidence cannot support. All three frameworks agree that workforce scarcity limits what transformation can accomplish, that **sustainability determines value** (temporary improvements do not constitute transformation), and that some approaches face better odds than others based on evidence quality, implementation feasibility, and sustainability prospects.

Helen Caudill is 79 years old and has lived in Owsley County, Kentucky, her entire life. The nursing home where staff knew her name closed in March 2024. She refused to relocate 68 miles away. She installed a commode in her kitchen behind a curtain she sewed herself and sleeps on the couch because her knees no longer manage stairs. She manages her diabetes by feel because the clinic is 40 minutes away and she no longer drives. She falls sometimes and has learned to wait on the floor until she can pull herself up using the kitchen chair. **She has not told anyone about the falls**. Earl Stinson farms in Jefferson County, Nebraska. Diabetic, on dialysis three times weekly, he drives himself 26 miles to treatment at 6 AM and home four hours later. His nephrologist mentioned that patients his age with his disease profile average four more years. Amber Dawson delivered her daughter in Kearney, 47 miles from home, 22 minutes after walking through the door. She thinks about what would have happened if there had been ice on Highway 30, if her labor had progressed faster, if anything had gone differently in any of the ways that things go differently.

**Transformation programs succeed or fail in individual lives**. The aggregate metrics that evaluation emphasizes (mortality rates, utilization changes, cost savings) emerge from accumulation of individual experiences. The human stakes establish the standard: did this help actual people facing actual problems? Certain findings achieve sufficient confidence to guide action.
