Over 35 percent of U.S. counties contain no hospital offering obstetric services, no birth center, and no obstetrician, gynecologist, or certified nurse midwife. These 1,104 maternity care deserts contain 2.3 million women of reproductive age who produce approximately 150,000 births annually. Nearly two-thirds of these deserts are rural. More than 400 maternity services closed between 2006 and 2020, a cascade that accelerated as rural hospitals collapsed under financial pressure. Maternal mortality in the most rural counties runs 60 percent higher than in large metropolitan areas, with rates reaching 32.9 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2021, an 89 percent increase since 2018. Black women die at 2.6 times the rate of white women regardless of education or income, with rural residence compounding disparities through distance, delay, and absence of care.

RHTP applications universally acknowledge this crisis. States propose telehealth prenatal care, midwifery expansion, doula programs, community health worker deployment, and perinatal regionalization. **The question is whether any intervention can meaningfully address a crisis caused by the financial unsustainability of low-volume obstetric services.** Rural hospitals closed maternity units because delivering 50 to 100 babies annually cannot support the staffing, equipment, and liability costs required. Grant funding can purchase equipment and train workers. Grant funding cannot change the arithmetic that made obstetric closures financially inevitable.

The evidence on rural maternal health interventions offers both promise and limitation. Midwifery-led care demonstrates strong outcomes for low-risk pregnancies. Doula support reduces cesarean rates and improves birth experiences. Community-based perinatal workers connect pregnant women to resources and care. **But each intervention assumes some level of healthcare infrastructure exists.** Telehealth prenatal care requires a facility for in-person delivery. Midwifery expansion requires practice authority and hospital relationships. Doula programs require someone to catch the baby when labor progresses. The hardest question is not which interventions work but whether any amount of intervention can substitute for missing hospitals, absent physicians, and closed obstetric units.

Fifty-six percent of rural counties lack any hospital obstetric services. The closures cluster across the Great Plains, the Deep South, Appalachia, and the interior West. Texas, Missouri, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Nebraska contain dozens of counties where the nearest delivering hospital lies 60, 80, or 100 miles away. Rural counties average five obstetrician-gynecologists per 100,000 population compared to 15 per 100,000 in urban areas. Nearly 40 percent of U.S. counties lack a single OB-GYN or certified nurse midwife. While midwives attend only 10 percent of U.S. births nationally, they provide care in one-third of rural hospitals that retain obstetric services.

OB unit closure does not occur in isolation. When a rural hospital discontinues obstetric services, it typically predicts broader facility decline. Obstetric closure signals the hospital cannot sustain specialized service lines requiring 24/7 staffing, call coverage, and capital investment. Within years, emergency services often degrade, specialists stop visiting, and the facility itself may close. From 2011 to 2023, 293 rural hospitals stopped providing obstetric services, representing 24 percent of rural obstetric units eliminated in just over a decade.

**The economics of rural obstetrics create a structural problem no grant can solve.** Medicaid pays for more than 40 percent of U.S. births and covers nearly half of births in maternity care deserts. Medicaid obstetric reimbursement averages half the rate of commercial insurance. Rural hospitals depending on Medicaid-dominant payer mixes cannot cover the costs of maintaining delivery capacity: round-the-clock nursing, anesthesia availability, blood bank requirements, emergency cesarean capability, and malpractice insurance premiums that reflect obstetric exposure. A rural hospital delivering 75 babies annually at Medicaid rates may generate $500,000 in obstetric revenue while incurring $800,000 in direct and indirect obstetric costs. The mathematics explain the closures without requiring explanations of hospital mismanagement or rural economic decline. The business model fails even when everything else succeeds.

The strongest evidence in maternal health supports risk-appropriate care through regionalization systems. High-risk pregnancies and deliveries concentrated at facilities with appropriate capability produce better outcomes than equivalent cases at lower-level facilities. Regionalization works for trauma, stroke, and cardiac care. It works for high-risk obstetrics. **The challenge in rural areas is that regionalization means travel.** Moving high-risk deliveries to Level III and IV facilities improves outcomes for those patients while potentially destabilizing lower-level rural facilities that lose volume and revenue. The policy question becomes whether to concentrate resources at regional centers accepting that rural facilities may close, or to distribute resources maintaining rural access accepting that outcomes may suffer. A 2024 study found that residing in a maternity care desert is significantly associated with higher rates of maternal and pregnancy-related mortality independent of socioeconomic factors. Counties without practitioners or facilities showed elevated mortality compared to counties with full maternity care access.

The evidence supporting midwifery-led care is extensive and consistent. A 2016 Cochrane systematic review of 15 trials involving over 17,000 women found that midwife-led continuity models reduce preterm birth, reduce fetal loss, and increase satisfaction compared to physician-led or fragmented care models. Women receiving midwife-led care experienced fewer interventions including regional anesthesia, episiotomy, and instrumental birth with no differences in cesarean rates or adverse outcomes. States where midwives are well integrated into healthcare systems demonstrate better maternal health outcomes than states with restrictive midwifery practice environments. Midwives disproportionately serve populations at risk of poor outcomes. Despite attending only 10 percent of U.S. births, midwives provide care for higher proportions of Medicaid patients, women of color, adolescents, and immigrants than the physician workforce. A 2023 analysis found that CNM full practice authority increased use of existing midwifery capacity without changes in obstetric outcomes, maternal mortality, or neonatal mortality.

The rural evidence limitation is important. Most midwifery research occurs in integrated systems with hospital backup, collaborative relationships, and transfer capacity. **Rural midwifery practice faces challenges when the nearest hospital with obstetric capability is 50 miles away.** The evidence supporting midwifery applies most clearly to contexts with functional referral systems, precisely the systems rural areas lack.

Freestanding birth centers provide evidence-based care for low-risk pregnancies with outcomes comparable to or better than hospital birth for appropriately selected patients. The American Association of Birth Centers Perinatal Data Registry tracked 88,574 courses of care across 82 sites between 2012 and 2020. Quality outcomes exceeded national benchmarks in both rural and urban settings. The cesarean rate among birth center patients was six percent compared to national averages exceeding 30 percent. Approximately 30 percent of birth centers operate in rural areas and small towns. The number of birth centers doubled over the past decade to 384 nationally, yet they account for only 0.5 percent of U.S. births (roughly 20,000 annually). **Regulatory barriers limit expansion.** Certificate of need requirements, facility building codes designed for hospitals, proximity requirements to hospitals, and mandatory transfer agreements with reluctant physician partners create obstacles particularly burdensome for rural areas lacking the hospital infrastructure these requirements assume.

Birth center care requires appropriate patient selection. The model serves low-risk patients: term gestation, singleton vertex presentation, no prior cesarean, no preeclampsia or gestational diabetes, no complications requiring specialized intervention. Transfer rates run 12 to 15 percent during labor, with 30 percent of first-time mothers transferring compared to four percent of mothers with prior births. The 98 percent of transfers are non-emergent, involving labor augmentation or epidural requests rather than emergencies. For communities that have lost hospital obstetric services, birth centers could potentially provide care for the majority of low-risk pregnancies while developing transfer agreements with distant hospitals for complications and high-risk patients. This model requires regulatory flexibility that most states have not provided.

Doula care improves birth outcomes through continuous emotional, physical, and informational support during pregnancy, labor, and postpartum. A 2017 Cochrane review of 26 randomized controlled trials involving over 15,000 women found that continuous labor support reduces cesarean births by 22 percent, decreases instrumental vaginal deliveries, shortens labor duration, and increases satisfaction. Effects are strongest for women who are low-income, socially disadvantaged, or face cultural and language barriers. Medicaid coverage for doula services expanded from zero states to 13 states plus the District of
