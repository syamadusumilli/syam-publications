The Rural Health Transformation Program's $50 billion flows primarily through hub-and-spoke networks that appear in nearly every state application. California proposes regional networks anchored by hospital hubs extending to critical access hospitals and rural clinics. Ohio envisions 5-7 geographic hubs coordinating care across rural regions. North Carolina plans four to six Hub Leads managing regional provider networks. The model's intuitive appeal is straightforward: concentrate specialized expertise at central hubs while maintaining distributed access points at spokes, allowing small facilities to deliver care they could not sustain independently.

This theoretical elegance obscures a fundamental tension. Hub-and-spoke models can either extend capacity outward from hubs to strengthen spokes or extract patients inward from spokes to consolidate volume at hubs. The same organizational architecture enables both outcomes. A hub providing telehealth consultations to rural emergency departments extends capacity. A hub absorbing patient volume from rural hospitals until they close extracts it. Whether RHTP hub-and-spoke investments strengthen or weaken rural healthcare depends entirely on implementation incentives that most state applications do not address.

Evidence for hub-and-spoke models shows strong outcomes for specific clinical conditions where regionalization is appropriate. Perinatal regionalization reduces neonatal and maternal mortality. Trauma system regionalization improves survival for seriously injured patients. Stroke networks increase thrombolysis rates and reduce disability. These successes share common features: time-sensitive conditions where specialized intervention clearly improves outcomes, established protocols for patient transfer and care coordination, and hub investment in spoke capabilities rather than spoke replacement.

The RHTP context differs fundamentally from these clinical successes. States propose hub-and-spoke models not for specific conditions but as general organizational architecture for rural health transformation. Innovation hubs coordinating primary care, maternal care networks spanning entire regions, behavioral health integration across provider types. The evidence supporting condition-specific regionalization does not automatically transfer to comprehensive healthcare coordination across diverse service lines. Rural hospital affiliation with health systems shows mixed results: improved mortality for some time-sensitive conditions but reduced service availability, eliminated service lines, and increased patient bypass to urban facilities. Affiliating rural hospitals experienced significant reductions in on-site diagnostic imaging, obstetric services, and primary care availability.

The critical question is whether RHTP networks preserve local capacity or accelerate the consolidation trend that has closed 146 rural hospitals since 2010. Hub-and-spoke models built through system affiliation may improve outcomes for transferred patients while reducing access for patients who do not transfer. This dynamic is not hypothetical. Research documents that rural hospitals affiliating with health systems see improved operating margins and better clinical outcomes for certain conditions, yet they also experience substantial service line reductions. The same organizational structure that produces better standardized care at hubs simultaneously drains volume from spokes until local services cannot sustain operations.

Geographic dispersion creates fundamental challenges for hub models designed in denser settings. Vermont's hub-and-spoke opioid treatment system operates across 9,600 square miles where 86 percent of residents are enrolled in primary care medical homes. Texas proposes similar coordination across 268,000 square miles where many rural counties have no primary care provider at all. The organizational architecture may be identical, but implementation contexts differ so dramatically that assuming transferability requires justification the applications do not provide. Critical access hospital financial dependence on hub relationships creates power asymmetries that shape network dynamics. CAHs operating on 2-3 percent margins cannot negotiate effectively with health systems whose resources dwarf their own. Transfer agreements, specialty consultation contracts, and electronic health record integration decisions occur between parties with vastly unequal leverage. The hub determines terms; spokes accept them or lose access to capabilities they cannot provide independently.

Patient bypass patterns reveal how rural residents perceive hub-and-spoke care. Approximately one-third of Medicare inpatient stays occur at facilities other than beneficiaries' closest hospital, even when services are available locally. Research shows rural residents are more likely to seek care at urban hospitals if their nearest hospital affiliates with a system. Affiliation may signal to rural residents that better care exists at the hub, encouraging bypass that drains volume from local facilities. Whether this benefits patients depends on whether hub care quality exceeds spoke care quality by enough to justify travel burden. For time-sensitive conditions, the answer is often yes. For routine care, the answer is often no, yet patients bypass anyway.

Transfer patterns and leakage determine whether spokes remain viable. A spoke that loses its more profitable service lines to hub transfer cannot sustain the less profitable services that remain. Obstetric delivery concentrates at hubs because liability, call coverage, and volume requirements exceed what small facilities can sustain. Emergency cases transfer to hubs for specialty intervention. What remains at spokes may not generate sufficient revenue for continued operation. The hub-and-spoke model that began as capacity extension becomes the pathway to spoke closure. Administrative burden of network participation falls disproportionately on small facilities with limited staff. Coordination meetings, data sharing requirements, protocol compliance, reporting obligations, and quality improvement activities consume administrative time that CAHs and rural health clinics can barely spare. A 25-bed hospital with one administrator cannot participate in network activities with the same intensity as a 500-bed hub with dedicated coordination staff.

The strongest evidence for hub-and-spoke healthcare comes from perinatal regionalization, the organization of maternity and newborn care into tiered systems where complexity of care matches facility capability. Evidence demonstrates that delivery at an appropriate-level facility reduces neonatal mortality. Very low birth weight infants born at Level III or IV facilities have significantly better survival rates than those born at lower-level facilities and transferred after birth. Implementation challenges persist despite strong evidence. The model works for identified high-risk pregnancies with time to transfer; it fails for emergencies presenting at local facilities. As rural maternity units close (more than 200 since 2004), the spoke infrastructure disappears. Patients travel farther for routine prenatal care or receive none. High-risk pregnancies go unidentified until labor presents at whatever facility remains accessible.

Trauma system development represents another hub-and-spoke success story, with documented mortality reductions from systematic organization of trauma care. Patients treated at Level I trauma centers have better outcomes than those treated at non-trauma centers. Higher trauma center volumes correlate with better outcomes. Rural interhospital transfer for trauma patients, though involving transport risk, produces net mortality benefit for appropriate cases. The volume-outcome relationship creates inherent tension with local access. Trauma centers need volume to maintain expertise and justify expense. Rural areas lack volume by definition. The solution has been to concentrate trauma capability at regional centers serving large geographic areas, improving outcomes for seriously injured patients who reach appropriate care while potentially worsening outcomes for patients who need emergent stabilization but face longer transport to any care at all.

Hub-and-spoke telestroke networks demonstrate effective capacity extension through technology. Comprehensive stroke centers provide remote consultation to primary stroke centers and non-certified hospitals that lack on-site neurology expertise. Evidence shows telestroke networks increase thrombolysis rates without requiring neurologist presence at every hospital. New York State data comparing hub-and-spoke care to exclusive comprehensive center care found no worse outcomes for patients treated in hub-and-spoke systems, challenging the assumption that patients must be transported directly to comprehensive centers. Technology enables genuine capacity extension without requiring specialized personnel at every site. Hub investment in spoke capability (stroke coordinators, certification support, protocol development) improves spoke performance rather than extracting patients.

Vermont's hub-and-spoke system for opioid use disorder treatment provides the most extensively documented behavioral health application of the model in rural settings. Within four years of implementation, Vermont achieved the highest per capita rate of medication-assisted treatment in the United States, with 1.47 percent of the entire state population receiving treatment. The number of waivered buprenorphine prescribers increased 64 percent. Patients served per waivered physician increased 50 percent. Waiting lists for treatment were eliminated statewide. The bidirectional transfer design proved critical: patients could start treatment at hubs and transfer to spokes when stable, while patients who became unstable at spokes could transfer back to hubs for intensive support. This safety net function prevented treatment disruption that would otherwise result from provider turnover or practice closure.

Applicability to RHTP contexts requires caution. Vermont is small, has high primary care medical home enrollment, and implemented the model statewide with dedicated Medicaid financing. States proposing similar models across much larger geographies, with weaker primary care infrastructure, and without equivalent financing mechanisms cannot assume comparable results. The Willis-Knighton partnership with DeSoto General Hospital provides the longest-documented hub-and-spoke rural health partnership in the literature. A struggling 34-bed rural hospital on the brink of closure partnered with a larger urban health system that provided expertise, capital investment, and operational support. Over three decades, the hospital transformed into a regional health system, expanding from a single struggling facility to include three rural primary care clinics, an industrial medicine clinic, and a therapy services center. Services expanded rather than contracted. The model demonstrates what long-term hub commitment to spoke viability can produce when both parties benefit continuously over decades.

Most state applications lack explicit protections against hub-and-spoke
