The Rural Health Transformation Program confronts a foundational paradox: **transformation strategies depend on infrastructure that transformation dollars cannot build**. Every state application invokes telehealth, remote patient monitoring, and electronic health records. Every state assumes connectivity exists to support these technologies. The assumption is frequently wrong. Approximately 26 million Americans lack broadband meeting minimum federal standards, with rural areas bearing disproportionate shares of disconnection. The result is a $50 billion investment in technology-dependent healthcare transformation proceeding simultaneously with persistent infrastructure gaps in the very communities transformation aims to serve.

The digital divide operates across multiple dimensions that compound to exclude populations from technology-enabled healthcare. Availability represents the first barrier: approximately 28 percent of rural Americans lack fixed terrestrial broadband access, compared to roughly 5 percent in urban areas. Tribal lands face steeper challenges, with more than 23 percent lacking access and some reservations reporting connectivity rates below 50 percent. The geography of unconnectedness overlaps substantially with health need. The Delta region, Appalachia, the rural South, and remote Western states appear consistently in both broadband desert maps and health shortage area designations. Communities most needing telehealth as substitute for absent providers often lack connectivity to support it.

Where infrastructure exists, significant adoption gaps persist. Income predicts adoption more strongly than availability: 81 percent of rural households with annual incomes above $150,000 subscribe to wireline broadband, compared with 55 percent of those with annual incomes below $25,000. Rural households pay more for service, averaging $72 monthly versus $62 in non-rural areas. Higher costs combined with lower incomes create affordability barriers that infrastructure investment alone cannot address. The Affordable Connectivity Program's expiration in June 2024 eliminated the primary federal mechanism for addressing affordability. At its peak, ACP served 23 million households nationwide, including 3.1 million in rural counties and 2.6 million in persistent poverty counties. With ACP's lapse, estimates suggest 5 million households have cut internet service entirely, with many more downgrading to slower, cheaper plans insufficient for telehealth video. No federal replacement program exists, and state-level affordability programs remain fragmented and inadequate.

Digital literacy represents the third barrier determining whether populations can actually use technology-enabled healthcare. Telehealth platforms require navigating video interfaces, patient portals demand password management and form completion, and remote monitoring devices require consistent patient engagement with connected equipment. Age correlates strongly with digital skill gaps, and rural populations skew older than urban populations, amplifying the literacy challenge. Elderly patients managing multiple chronic conditions represent both the population most likely to benefit from remote monitoring and the population least likely to successfully use it. The COVID-era telehealth expansion revealed these literacy barriers starkly: providers reported that audio-only services reached populations that video visits excluded. Medicare data confirmed that beneficiaries who were older, had lower incomes, were Black or Hispanic, or lived in rural areas were less likely to have smartphones with wireless plans or computers with high-speed internet. Digital literacy programs exist but remain small-scale and inconsistent. Most RHTP applications mention digital literacy briefly if at all, and few states allocate significant transformation dollars to helping patients actually use the technology being deployed.

RHTP technology investments exist within a broader federal infrastructure investment landscape creating both opportunity and coordination challenges. The Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program represents the largest federal broadband infrastructure investment in history at $42.45 billion. As of January 2026, 42 of 56 states and territories have had Final Proposals approved by NTIA. Construction on BEAD-funded projects is expected to begin in summer 2026, with network completion extending through 2028 or later. For RHTP purposes, **BEAD timing creates a critical sequencing problem**: states are implementing telehealth and remote monitoring programs now, while BEAD-funded infrastructure will not become operational until 2027 or 2028. The two-to-three year gap means transformation investments may precede connectivity in some communities. Program restructuring in June 2025 significantly altered implementation, with the Trump administration's reforms shifting technology selection criteria, reducing fiber prioritization and enabling greater use of fixed wireless and satellite alternatives. States' revised proposals came in approximately $21 billion under original budget projections, raising questions about whether scope reductions mean fewer locations served or less future-proof infrastructure.

Analysis of state RHTP applications reveals that **technology investment proceeds largely without realistic assessment of infrastructure prerequisites**. Telehealth expansion appears in every state's plan, 47 states include remote patient monitoring initiatives, and 44 states include health information exchange enhancements. Most applications treat connectivity as existing condition rather than prerequisite requiring investment. States with established broadband programs (Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi) coordinate explicitly, referencing BEAD timelines in their RHTP applications and sequencing technology deployments accordingly. States with advanced state broadband offices demonstrate better integration. States with significant unconnected populations often acknowledge the gap without resolving it, expressing hope that federal infrastructure programs will address them while giving insufficient attention to the gap between RHTP implementation timelines and BEAD completion. Tribal health initiatives within state applications face the most acute prerequisite problems, with Indian Health Service facilities and Tribal health programs often serving communities with the lowest connectivity rates and few state applications adequately addressing Tribal infrastructure coordination.

Digital literacy receives cursory treatment in most applications. Common approaches include brief mentions without budget allocation, assumptions of existing programs without assessing their adequacy for health technology training, and device provision without instruction. A minority of states (California, Oregon, Washington) include funded digital navigator positions connecting communities with both technology and training, but these programs remain exceptions. The pattern suggests states recognize the problem while declining to allocate resources sufficient to address it.

RHTP program rules prohibit direct broadband infrastructure construction. States cannot use transformation dollars to build fiber networks, install fixed wireless towers, or subsidize internet service. The funding mechanism assumes infrastructure exists or will exist through other programs. This constraint reflects appropriate program scope (CMS runs healthcare programs, not telecommunications infrastructure programs), but it creates implementation tension when transformation strategies depend on infrastructure that falls outside program authority. Workarounds exist but remain limited: states can fund connectivity equipment for healthcare facilities (routers, network termination equipment), and some interpret digital health platform investments broadly. Patient-facing connectivity remains firmly outside scope.

RHTP technology investments face stranding risk if infrastructure fails to materialize. Equipment deployed to facilities lacks utility without patient connectivity, training provided to providers produces no benefit if patients cannot access services, and care coordination platforms serve no purpose if participating entities cannot reliably connect. The sequencing mismatch between RHTP and BEAD amplifies this risk. States implementing telehealth expansion in 2026 while BEAD networks complete in 2028 face two years of partial functionality. Rural communities may receive transformation investments before they can use them. Digital infrastructure also requires ongoing operational funding that one-time grants cannot sustain: broadband subscriptions continue monthly after installation, devices require replacement as technology advances, and platforms require licensing fees and maintenance. RHTP's five-year timeframe provides limited sustainability runway. Without sustainable funding models through Medicaid reimbursement for telehealth, value-based payment arrangements including technology costs, or dedicated state appropriations, transformation gains erode as grant periods end.

The realistic scenario by 2030 suggests mixed results across states and communities. States with strong coordination between RHTP, BEAD, and state broadband programs achieve meaningful technology-enabled transformation. States with fragmented authority and limited coordination experience partial failures. Within states, communities with existing infrastructure benefit while infrastructure-gap communities wait. Urban-rural and income-based digital divides persist within rural areas themselves. Current evidence suggests coordination quality varies substantially across states, producing uneven outcomes that track existing implementation capacity disparities.

The central question is whether states should sequence digital infrastructure before health technology, pursue parallel investments hoping timing aligns, or accept that some populations will remain excluded from technology-dependent transformation. The answer varies by state context, but honest assessment of infrastructure gaps should inform program design, directing technology investments where prerequisites exist and alternative approaches where they do not. Communities lacking infrastructure can still benefit from transformation investments that do not require patient-side connectivity: facility upgrades, provider training, care coordination improvements, and workforce development. Technology-dependent initiatives should target high-connectivity communities while infrastructure programs address gaps. The alternative is expensive equipment sitting unused, training that produces no benefit, and transformation that excludes the populations most needing it. **The question is not whether broadband improves health, but whether transformation investments proceed faster than the infrastructure required to support them.**
