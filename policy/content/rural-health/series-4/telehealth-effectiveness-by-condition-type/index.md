Every state RHTP application proposes telehealth expansion. Few applications distinguish between telehealth modalities or acknowledge that effectiveness varies dramatically by clinical application. This technical document provides **condition-specific evidence synthesis** enabling states and evaluators to assess whether proposed telehealth investments match evidence-supported use cases.

The document applies the evidence rating framework from Technical Document 4A to telehealth specifically, organizing findings by both **condition category** and **telehealth modality**. Not all telehealth is created equal. Video psychiatry consultations have different evidence than remote monitoring for heart failure, which differs from direct-to-consumer urgent care visits. RHTP investments should flow toward applications with demonstrated effectiveness, not toward telehealth generically.

Rural context matters throughout. **Most telehealth research originates in urban academic medical centers** with populations, infrastructure, and clinical resources that differ from rural implementation settings. This document explicitly notes rural evidence availability and identifies where urban findings may or may not transfer.

## Telehealth Modality Definitions

Four primary telehealth modalities appear in RHTP applications. Each has distinct technical requirements, clinical applications, and evidence bases.

### Synchronous Video (Real-Time)

**Definition:** Live, two-way audiovisual communication between patient and provider or between providers, occurring in real time.

**Technical Requirements:**
- Minimum **3 Mbps download/upload** for reliable video quality
- HIPAA-compliant platform with encryption
- Camera, microphone, and display on both ends
- Scheduling and workflow integration

**Clinical Applications:**
- Behavioral health therapy and medication management
- Specialist consultations
- Follow-up visits
- Provider-to-provider consultations (telestroke, tele-ICU)

**Strengths:** Approximates in-person interaction, enables visual assessment, allows real-time dialogue.

**Limitations:** Requires simultaneous availability, depends on connectivity, cannot perform physical examination, patient technology barriers.

### Asynchronous (Store-and-Forward)

**Definition:** Transmission of recorded health information (images, video, audio, text) to a provider who reviews and responds at a later time.

**Technical Requirements:**
- Lower bandwidth acceptable (can transmit during connectivity windows)
- Image capture devices appropriate to specialty
- Secure transmission and storage
- Response time protocols

**Clinical Applications:**
- Dermatology (clinical images)
- Ophthalmology (retinal imaging)
- Radiology (image interpretation)
- Wound care documentation
- Pathology consultation

**Strengths:** Does not require simultaneous connectivity, works in low-bandwidth environments, specialist reviews on own schedule, documentation inherent.

**Limitations:** No real-time interaction, requires adequate image quality, delay in response, limited to conditions amenable to image-based assessment.

### Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM)

**Definition:** Collection and transmission of patient health data from home to care team using connected devices, with clinical oversight and intervention protocols.

**Technical Requirements:**
- Connected monitoring devices (scales, blood pressure cuffs, glucometers, pulse oximeters)
- Cellular or WiFi connectivity for data transmission
- Platform for data aggregation and alerting
- Staff for monitoring and response

**Clinical Applications:**
- Heart failure (weight, vital signs)
- Hypertension (blood pressure)
- Diabetes (glucose monitoring)
- COPD (pulse oximetry, symptoms)
- Post-discharge monitoring

**Strengths:** Continuous data collection, early deterioration detection, patient engagement, reduced travel for monitoring visits.

**Limitations:** Requires patient device use compliance, alert fatigue risk, staffing for monitoring, limited evidence for many conditions.

### Audio-Only

**Definition:** Telephone-based healthcare encounters without video component.

**Technical Requirements:**
- Telephone access only
- No broadband required
- Minimal technology barriers

**Clinical Applications:**
- Behavioral health (therapy, medication management)
- Care coordination
- Chronic disease check-ins
- Results communication
- Triage and guidance

**Strengths:** Universal access, no technology barriers, reaches populations excluded by video, familiar medium.

**Limitations:** No visual assessment, limited documentation, lower reimbursement in some states, perception as inferior to video.

## Condition-Specific Evidence Detail

### Mental Health

**Evidence Quality: Strong**
**Effect Size: Moderate to Large (equivalent outcomes)**
**Rural Evidence: Yes**

Mental health represents telehealth's **strongest and most consistent evidence domain**. The AHRQ 2016 Evidence Map identified multiple systematic reviews showing equivalent outcomes between telehealth and in-person mental health treatment across depression, anxiety, PTSD, and substance use disorders.

**Synchronous Video:**
Randomized controlled trials demonstrate non-inferiority of video-based cognitive behavioral therapy compared to in-person delivery. Patient satisfaction scores are generally equivalent or higher for telehealth. **Effect sizes for symptom improvement match in-person care across conditions.**

**Audio-Only:**
COVID-era research confirmed that audio-only mental health services reach populations excluded by video requirements. Medicare data show that beneficiaries using audio-only services are **older, have lower incomes, and are more likely to be Black or Hispanic** than video users. Congress established permanent payment parity for audio-only mental health services recognizing this access function.

**Rural Considerations:**
Rural behavioral health telehealth addresses both **provider shortage and stigma**. Patients in small communities may avoid local mental health services due to confidentiality concerns. Receiving care from a distant provider removes this barrier. Evidence from rural-specific programs (Mississippi, Montana, Wyoming) shows strong uptake and outcomes.

**Implementation Factors:**
- Licensing: Interstate telehealth requires licensure in patient's state
- Prescribing: Controlled substance prescribing has specific requirements (Ryan Haight Act modifications)
- Relationship establishment: Some payers require initial in-person visit
- Crisis protocols: Remote providers need local emergency response connections

### Stroke (Acute Telestroke)

**Evidence Quality: Strong**
**Effect Size: Large (mortality and disability reduction)**
**Rural Evidence: Yes**

**Telestroke represents telehealth's clearest success story.** The STRokE DOC trials established that video-based neurologist consultation produces outcomes equivalent to in-person evaluation, with the critical advantage of availability where neurologists are not physically present.

**Synchronous Video:**
Rural hospitals implementing telestroke networks demonstrate **significant improvements in tPA administration rates and door-to-needle times**. The Medical University of South Carolina network documented meaningful outcome improvements across rural South Carolina hospitals. Similar results appear in Montana, Arizona, Georgia, and international settings.

The evidence base includes **multiple randomized trials and large observational studies** with consistent findings. Effect sizes are clinically meaningful: getting tPA to eligible patients within the treatment window prevents disability and death.

**Implementation Factors:**
- 24/7 hub neurologist availability required
- Rural hospital must maintain CT imaging capability
- Staff training in stroke protocols essential
- Equipment and connectivity reliability critical for emergency use
- Sustainability requires ongoing operational funding beyond initial capital

**Rural Considerations:**
Time-critical stroke intervention cannot wait for patient transfer. **Telestroke enables treatment initiation at the presenting facility** while arranging transfer if needed. Networks must include protocols for both "drip and ship" (treat and transfer) and "drip and stay" (treat locally when appropriate) scenarios.

### Critical Care (Tele-ICU)

**Evidence Quality: Moderate**
**Effect Size: Moderate (mortality reduction)**
**Rural Evidence: Yes**

Remote ICU consultation enables intensivists at academic medical centers to monitor multiple rural ICUs simultaneously. **AHRQ synthesis found moderate-strength evidence** that tele-ICU likely reduces ICU and total hospital mortality with no significant difference in length of stay.

**Technical Model:**
Central monitoring facility with intensivists and critical care nurses reviews patient data, responds to alerts, and conducts scheduled rounds via video. Some models involve continuous monitoring; others provide on-demand consultation.

**Implementation Factors:**
- **Very high implementation costs** (equipment, connectivity, staffing)
- Requires rural hospital willingness to accept outside oversight
- Workflow integration challenges between tele-ICU and local teams
- Sustainability requires health system investment or sustainable financing model

**Rural Considerations:**
Rural critical access hospitals often lack intensivist coverage. Tele-ICU extends specialist oversight without requiring local intensivist recruitment. However, **cost makes this intervention feasible primarily for resourced health systems**, limiting applicability to independent rural hospitals.

### Dermatology

**Evidence Quality: Strong (store-and-forward), Moderate (synchronous)**
**Effect Size: Moderate**
**Rural Evidence: Yes**

Dermatology represents the **strongest use case for asynchronous telehealth**. Image-based diagnosis allows specialists to review clinical photographs without requiring simultaneous connectivity.

**Store-and-Forward:**
High-quality clinical images enable diagnosis of most dermatologic conditions. Multiple studies demonstrate diagnostic concordance between store-and-forward teledermatology and in-person examination. The **Alaska AFHCAN model** pioneered this approach in extreme rural and frontier settings with limited connectivity.

**Synchronous Video:**
Real-time video consultation provides acceptable visualization for many conditions but is generally **inferior to store-and-forward** for dermatology specifically. High-resolution images captured deliberately outperform video frame captures.

**Implementation Factors:**
- Image capture training essential for quality
- Standardized photography protocols improve diagnostic accuracy
- Some conditions require in-person examination (palpation for depth, dermoscopy)
- Integration with dermatopathology when biopsy needed

### Diabetic Retinopathy Screening

**Evidence Quality: Strong (store-and-forward)**
**Effect Size: Moderate to Large (screening rates)**
**Rural Evidence: Yes**

Retinal imaging transmitted to ophthalmologists for interpretation enables diabetic retinopathy screening in primary care settings. **This represents a proven population health intervention** with strong evidence.

**Store-and-Forward:**
Non-mydriatic retinal cameras operated by trained technicians capture images in primary care clinics. Images transmit to reading centers where ophthalmologists interpret and provide recommendations. Studies demonstrate **high sensitivity and specificity** compared to in-person dilated examination.

**Implementation Factors:**
- Camera equipment cost ($15,000-$50,000)
- Technician training for image capture
- Reading center relationship or contracted interpretation
- Follow-up protocols for abnormal findings

**Rural Considerations:**
Many rural diabetic patients have never had retinal examination. **Point-of-care screening eliminates the travel and specialty access barrier** that prevents recommended screening. Multiple HRSA-funded programs demonstrate feasibility in rural FQHCs.

### Chronic Disease Management (Heart Failure, Diabetes, Hypertension, COPD)

**Evidence Quality: Moderate**
**Effect Size: Small to Moderate**
**Rural Evidence: Limited**

Chronic disease represents telehealth's most promoted yet most variable evidence domain. Effectiveness depends heavily on condition, modality, and implementation quality.

**Remote Patient Monitoring:**
AHRQ evidence synthesis found positive outcomes for RPM in chronic conditions, particularly heart failure and COPD, with improvements in mortality, quality of life, and hospital admissions. However, **effect sizes are generally small**, and evidence quality is moderate due to study heterogeneity.

Heart failure monitoring (daily weights, symptom tracking) shows the strongest RPM evidence. Significant reductions in heart failure hospitalizations appear in well-implemented programs. However, **implementation difficulty is substantial**: programs require monitoring staff, response protocols, and patient engagement.

Diabetes RPM (continuous glucose monitoring, connected glucometers) demonstrates moderate effectiveness for glycemic control but **primarily in motivated, technologically capable patients**. Rural generalizability concerns exist.

**Synchronous Video:**
Video visits for chronic disease management provide acceptable care for stable patients but **cannot substitute entirely for in-person evaluation**. Periodic hands-on assessment remains necessary. The optimal model combines telehealth for routine monitoring with in-person visits for comprehensive evaluation.

**Audio-Only:**
Telephone-based chronic disease management reaches patients excluded by video technology requirements. Evidence suggests acceptable outcomes for stable chronic disease follow-up, though **less data exist than for video**.

**Rural Considerations:**
Most RPM research occurred in **urban academic medical center populations**. Device provision, connectivity, digital literacy, and monitoring infrastructure create implementation barriers in rural settings. RHTP applications proposing extensive RPM should acknowledge these limitations.

### Post-Surgical Follow-Up

**Evidence Quality: Moderate**
**Effect Size: Moderate**
**Rural Evidence: Limited**

Video visits for post-surgical follow-up demonstrate **acceptable outcomes for uncomplicated cases**. Wound visualization, symptom review, and activity progression can occur remotely.

**Synchronous Video:**
Orthopedic, general surgery, and other specialties report satisfactory outcomes using video follow-up for appropriate patients. Patient satisfaction is generally high due to eliminated travel. **Selection criteria matter**: complex wounds, signs of infection, or functional concerns require in-person evaluation.

**Asynchronous:**
Patient-submitted wound photographs with structured questionnaires enable asynchronous post-operative assessment. Some practices use this for routine check-ins between scheduled visits.

**Implementation Factors:**
- Patient selection protocols essential
- Clear criteria for escalation to in-person evaluation
- Integration with surgical team workflow
- Emergency contact protocols

### Pediatrics

**Evidence Quality: Variable by Application**
**Effect Size: Variable**
**Rural Evidence: Limited**

Pediatric telehealth effectiveness varies substantially by clinical application and child age.

**Behavioral Health:**
Pediatric behavioral health via telehealth shows **moderate effectiveness** but faces engagement challenges with younger children. Parent involvement is essential for successful pediatric telebehavioral health.

**Primary Care:**
Limited evidence supports telehealth for pediatric primary care. **Physical examination limitations are more significant in pediatrics** where developmental assessment, growth monitoring, and hands-on evaluation remain essential.

**Specialty Consultations:**
Provider-to-provider telehealth enables pediatric specialists to consult on complex cases without requiring family travel. This model shows promise but **evidence base remains limited**.

**Rural Considerations:**
Rural families face significant travel burden for pediatric specialty care. Telehealth offers genuine access improvement. However, **pediatric-specific evidence is sparse**, and extrapolation from adult studies has limitations.

## Inappropriate Telehealth Applications

Certain clinical scenarios are **not appropriate for telehealth regardless of modality**. RHTP applications should not propose telehealth for:

**Conditions Requiring Physical Examination:**
- Initial diagnostic evaluation for undifferentiated symptoms
- Complex multisystem disease requiring integrated assessment
- Pediatric developmental evaluation
- Conditions requiring palpation, auscultation, or neurological examination

**Emergency Conditions:**
- Acute chest pain, shortness of breath, or stroke symptoms requiring immediate intervention
- Trauma assessment
- Acute psychiatric emergencies requiring physical safety assessment

**Conditions Requiring Procedures:**
- Surgical interventions
- Diagnostic procedures (endoscopy, cardiac catheterization)
- Therapeutic procedures (injections, wound care beyond visual monitoring)
