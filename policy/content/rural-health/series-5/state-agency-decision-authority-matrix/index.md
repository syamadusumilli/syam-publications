This technical document provides a **comprehensive reference** documenting who holds decision authority for RHTP implementation across all 50 states. The document distinguishes between formal authority (what organizational charts show) and actual authority (who makes decisions in practice), revealing the authority gaps that shape implementation outcomes.

This is not merely a directory. It organizes data to reveal **patterns of authority concentration, fragmentation, and gap** that predict implementation success or struggle. Users should consult this document when seeking to understand state-specific governance dynamics, identify comparable states for cross-state learning, or assess where formal accountability diverges from actual implementation control.

## Methodology

### Data Sources

**Primary sources** include state RHTP applications, CMS cooperative agreement documentation, state organizational charts, and Governor executive orders. **Secondary sources** include NASHP policy analyses, state news coverage, and prior federal program evaluations. **Gap assessments** derive from analysis of decision patterns, revision histories, and stakeholder interviews where available.

### Authority Gap Classification

| Classification | Definition | Indicators |
|----------------|------------|------------|
| **Low** | Lead agency controls resources and decisions | Fast implementation timelines, minimal revision to proposals, lead agency spokesperson dominance |
| **Moderate** | Lead agency decides within constraints set by others | Required coordination with Medicaid/Governor, moderate revision patterns, shared public representation |
| **High** | Lead agency implements decisions made elsewhere | Extensive Governor review, Medicaid override on key decisions, long approval timelines |
| **Very High** | Lead agency lacks meaningful decision authority | Nominal lead with decisions made by Governor's office or other agencies, symbolic role |

### Limitations

Authority gaps are difficult to observe directly. Assessments reflect available evidence but cannot capture all informal dynamics, personal relationships, or political contexts that shape actual decision-making. Assessments should be treated as **informed estimates subject to revision** as implementation proceeds and additional evidence emerges.

## Section 6: States to Watch

### High Authority Gap States

These states demonstrate significant gaps between formal lead agency designation and actual implementation control:

| State | Gap Level | Key Concern | Monitoring Priority |
|-------|-----------|-------------|---------------------|
| Mississippi | High | Capacity limitations, non-expansion politics | Implementation delays, CMS intervention |
| South Carolina | High | Political constraints, under-resourced agency | Subaward execution, performance |
| Arkansas | Moderate-High | Fiscal lead vs. programmatic implementation | DFA-UAMS coordination, budget alignment |
| Tennessee | Moderate-High | Separate TennCare, non-expansion politics | DOH-TennCare coordination |
| Pennsylvania | Moderate-High | Split health/welfare, procurement constraints | Timeline execution |

### Low Gap States with Scale Challenges

These states have aligned authority but face implementation complexity:

| State | Authority Alignment | Scale Challenge | Monitoring Priority |
|-------|--------------------|-----------------|--------------------|
| Texas | Moderate | 4.3M rural residents, 254 counties | Regional coordination, equity |
| California | Moderate | 2.7M rural residents, CalAIM complexity | Waiver integration, hub execution |
| Michigan | Low | 2.0M rural residents, Upper Peninsula | Geographic variation |
| North Carolina | Low-Moderate | 3.4M rural residents, recent expansion | Expansion integration |

### States with Political Transition Risk

| State | Current Structure | Risk Factor | Potential Impact |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|------------------|
| Georgia | DCH with expansion transition | 2026 elections | Policy direction |
| North Carolina | DHHS with recent expansion | Political volatility | Program continuity |
| Wisconsin | DHS with BadgerCare | Expansion politics | Coverage integration |
| Arizona | AHCCCS with trigger law | FMAP reduction risk | Fundamental restructuring |
