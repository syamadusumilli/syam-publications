The Rural Health Transformation Program confronts a fundamental governance problem: the federal government awarded $50 billion to 50 lead agencies operating under vastly different structures, with authority gaps that often separate formal designation from actual implementation control. This technical document maps who truly holds decision power across all states, revealing that **30% of lead agencies face moderate to very high authority gaps** where the designated implementer lacks meaningful control over budgets, contracts, or program direction.

The document distinguishes between organizational charts and operational reality. Alabama's Department of Public Health appears to lead implementation, but budget authority flows through the Governor's office while Medicaid operates independently. Arkansas designated its Department of Finance and Administration as lead, creating a fiscal-programmatic split where DFA manages money while the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences delivers services. Pennsylvania's Department of Health holds formal authority yet must coordinate with a separate Department of Human Services for Medicaid decisions, procurement running through Department of General Services, and political oversight from the Governor. These are not administrative details. They are **structural impediments that determine whether programs move at startup speed or bureaucratic pace**.

The data show clear patterns. States with consolidated health and human services agencies demonstrate low authority gaps 63% of the time, while states separating health departments from Medicaid agencies generate moderate or higher gaps in most cases. Small population states like Delaware, Vermont, and North Dakota concentrate authority effectively regardless of formal structure, benefiting from direct relationships and minimal bureaucratic distance. Large states face authority distribution by necessity, but some manage complexity better than others. Michigan consolidated its Department of Health and Human Services and built implementation capacity. Texas runs an enormous system through its Health and Human Services Commission but maintains clear internal coordination. Illinois and Pennsylvania, by contrast, operate fragmented structures where authority scatters across multiple agencies with competing priorities.

**Medicaid positioning shapes implementation velocity more than any other structural factor**. The four states where Medicaid agencies serve as RHTP leads (Arizona, Connecticut, Missouri, New Mexico) demonstrate low to low-moderate authority gaps because payment reform and provider network development sit within a single organizational boundary. Oregon's unified Health Authority produces similar alignment. Conversely, states where health departments lead while Medicaid operates separately face persistent coordination friction. Minnesota's Department of Health must negotiate continuously with the Department of Human Services. Virginia's Department of Health coordinates with the Department of Medical Assistance Services. These relationships function, but they require constant maintenance and introduce decision delays that consolidated structures avoid.

Authority gaps concentrate in non-expansion states facing both political constraints and capacity limitations. Mississippi, South Carolina, Kansas, and Tennessee designated lead agencies that formally control RHTP implementation while operating in political environments hostile to Medicaid expansion, federal healthcare initiatives, or both. **Mississippi's State Department of Health holds lead designation but functions within a context where the Governor opposes expansion, the legislature restricts federal program flexibility, and agency capacity remains limited after years of constrained budgets**. South Carolina's Department of Health and Environmental Control faces similar dynamics. These gaps do not necessarily predict failure, but they create implementation conditions where federal expectations diverge sharply from state political realities.

The functional authority assessment reveals where implementation decisions actually get made. Only 20 states operate under lead-dominant patterns where the designated agency controls budgets, approves subawards, selects vendors, and takes performance action without extensive external coordination. Another 22 states function under lead-with-constraints patterns where agencies make decisions within procurement rules, budget approval processes, or administrative requirements that slow but do not block action. Six states distribute authority across multiple entities, requiring Governor approval for major decisions, shared control between lead agencies and Medicaid, or fiscal oversight that operates as de facto program control. Arkansas represents the extreme case: its Department of Finance and Administration leads on paper, but UAMS implements programs, central procurement selects vendors, and actual authority fragments across the governance structure.

Federal relationship patterns compound or mitigate authority gaps. CMS maintains collaborative relationships with 29 states characterized by proactive communication, problem-solving orientation, and high trust levels. These partnerships develop fastest in expansion states with Medicaid innovation history (Kentucky, Massachusetts, Oregon, New Mexico) or small states where direct relationships form easily (Alaska, Delaware, Rhode Island). **Twelve states operate under compliance-focused patterns where federal engagement remains formal, rule-bound, and minimally flexible**. Florida, Tennessee, Texas, and others in this category face political dynamics that constrain both state initiative and federal accommodation. CMS cannot ignore formal requirements when state governments signal potential conflict, and states cannot request flexibility when political leadership views federal accommodation as ideological compromise.

Six states show developing relationships where trajectories remain unclear. Missouri and Nebraska recently expanded Medicaid through ballot initiatives despite gubernatorial opposition, creating partnership possibilities alongside political complications. North Carolina expanded in 2023, transforming its federal relationship but still building the administrative infrastructure that mature expansion states developed over the past decade. Georgia implemented limited expansion in 2024 under a waiver model that creates coordination complexity. These states operate in transition, with implementation success depending partly on how quickly federal and state administrators build trust and establish reliable communication patterns.

The states-to-watch section identifies where authority gaps create highest implementation risk. Mississippi and South Carolina combine high authority gaps with capacity constraints and political resistance, producing conditions where CMS may need to intervene directly if subaward execution stalls or performance requirements go unmet. Arkansas presents a different risk profile: moderate-high authority gap stemming from structural fragmentation rather than political opposition, where the Department of Finance and Administration must coordinate with UAMS, procurement systems, and budget authorities in ways that slow decision-making. Tennessee and Pennsylvania face moderate-high gaps from different sources, Tennessee from political tensions between the Department of Health and separately operated TennCare, Pennsylvania from the sheer complexity of coordinating health, human services, and procurement across a large state bureaucracy.

Low-gap states with scale challenges present the inverse problem: aligned authority structures attempting to implement programs across massive populations or complex geographies. Texas serves 4.3 million rural residents across 254 counties, a scale that strains even well-designed coordination systems. California coordinates 2.7 million rural residents while integrating RHTP with CalAIM waiver requirements that add layers of federal approval and reporting. Michigan covers 2.0 million rural residents including the isolated Upper Peninsula, where geographic variation complicates standardized approaches. North Carolina's 3.4 million rural residents make it the largest rural population receiving RHTP funds, a scale that tests the Department of Health and Human Services' capacity even as expansion integration proceeds.

**Political transition risk operates independently of authority gaps**. Georgia, North Carolina, Wisconsin, and Arizona maintain functional governance structures but face 2026 elections or policy triggers that could fundamentally alter program direction. Georgia's partial expansion created a fragile political compromise that subsequent administrations might reverse or expand. North Carolina's recent expansion came through legislative action despite years of opposition, leaving implementation vulnerable to political shifts. Wisconsin's expansion debate continues despite BadgerCare's long history, with RHTP implementation potentially caught in broader coverage fights. Arizona's AHCCCS operates under a trigger law that could require complete program restructuring if federal Medicaid matching rates decline, transforming a smoothly functioning lead agency model into emergency crisis management.

The document rests on specific methodological limitations that users must understand. Authority gap assessments derive from state applications, organizational charts, executive orders, public documentation, and available interviews, but they cannot capture all informal dynamics, personal relationships, or political contexts that shape decision-making in practice. A state assessed as having moderate authority gap might function smoothly because of strong personal relationships between agency heads, or it might experience significant friction despite formal coordination mechanisms. These assessments represent informed estimates based on observable evidence, not definitive judgments about implementation capacity. They should guide analysis and monitoring priorities, not replace ongoing observation of how authority actually operates as implementation proceeds.

The comprehensive state listings provide reference data for cross-state comparison and pattern analysis. Lead agency types distribute unevenly: 24 health departments, 19 combined health and human services agencies, four Medicaid or social services departments, and three other configurations including Oregon's unique Health Authority and California's Department of Health Care Access and Information. **Authority gap levels distribute across a spectrum from 15 low-gap states through 11 low-moderate, 17 moderate, four moderate-high, to three high-gap states**, showing that most lead agencies function with at least moderate decision authority even when facing coordination requirements or political constraints.

The coordination partner assessments identify where implementation authority truly concentrates by mapping relationships between lead agencies, Medicaid programs, hospital networks, tribal health systems, academic medical centers, and regional organizations. These relationships reveal power distribution more accurately than organizational charts. California's coordination involves the Department of Health Care Services, local health departments, and CalAIM waiver partners in a complex distributed network. Arkansas coordinates between DFA, UAMS, hospitals, and Delta region partners with authority genuinely shared rather than concentrated. Small states like Vermont, Rhode Island, and Delaware operate tight networks where all major players interact directly, reducing coordination costs through relationship density.

The federal relationship patterns connect to authority gaps without determining them. Collaborative CMS relationships develop most readily with states demonstrating aligned internal authority, expansion status providing both coverage infrastructure and federal partnership experience. But exceptions exist: Oklahoma maintains collaborative CMS relationships despite SoonerSelect complexity
