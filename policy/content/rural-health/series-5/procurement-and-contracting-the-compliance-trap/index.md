RHTP 5.C
Procurement and Contracting: The Compliance Trap

Procurement determines who implements RHTP. The organizations selected through state contracting processes, the vendors awarded technology platforms, the intermediaries designated as subawardees: these decisions shape whether transformation dollars produce transformation outcomes. Yet state procurement systems were designed to purchase commodities, not to build transformation partnerships. The rules that protect against corruption and favoritism also slow implementation, favor incumbent vendors, and prioritize procedural compliance over results achievement.

**This article examines the fundamental tension between process compliance and outcome achievement.** States that follow procurement rules meticulously may fail to meet RHTP implementation timelines. States that streamline procurement to accelerate implementation may face audit findings, political criticism, or federal compliance concerns. Neither approach is obviously correct. The evidence suggests that most states can manage corruption risk better than they can manage implementation delay, but the political economy of procurement makes streamlining difficult even when it would improve outcomes.

**Analytical uncertainty is significant.** Procurement processes are documented, but their actual effects on implementation quality are rarely measured. States do not track whether competitive procurement produces better vendors than sole-source selection. The relationship between procurement timeline and implementation success remains largely unexamined. This article assesses available evidence while acknowledging substantial gaps.

## The Fundamental Tension

### The Case for Rigorous Procurement

State procurement regulations exist for legitimate reasons. **Public funds require accountability.** Taxpayers deserve assurance that their dollars flow to qualified vendors through fair processes rather than to political allies through backroom deals. Competitive procurement theoretically identifies the most capable vendors at the best prices. Documentation requirements create audit trails that enable oversight. Standardized processes ensure consistent treatment across vendors and regions.

The history of government contracting justifies caution. **Procurement scandals regularly damage public trust**: no-bid contracts to connected firms, vendors that underperform after award, cost overruns that dwarf original estimates. Rigorous procurement processes developed as responses to these failures. Relaxing standards invites their recurrence.

Federal requirements reinforce state caution. **2 CFR Part 200, the Uniform Administrative Requirements for federal awards, mandates competitive procurement for most purchases exceeding simplified acquisition thresholds.** States must document procurement methods, maintain records demonstrating fair and open competition, and justify any deviations from competitive processes. CMS oversight of RHTP includes procurement compliance review. States that circumvent procurement requirements risk audit findings, fund disallowances, or enhanced federal monitoring.

### The Case for Procurement Flexibility

Procurement rules designed to prevent problems create different problems. **Lowest-bid requirements favor vendors that underbid to win contracts, then underperform or request change orders once work begins.** The vendors most skilled at writing proposals may not be the vendors most skilled at implementation. Evaluation criteria that can be objectively scored (price, years of experience, number of references) may matter less than factors that resist quantification (organizational culture, leadership quality, genuine commitment to mission).

**Transformation differs from commodity purchasing.** Procurement rules assume that purchasers know exactly what they need and can specify requirements clearly. But transformation involves adaptation, learning, and evolution. Requirements that seem appropriate at RFP issuance may prove inadequate as implementation reveals unforeseen challenges. Procurement processes that lock in specifications for five-year contracts assume stability that transformation programs cannot provide.

**Timeline collision is the most concrete problem.** RHTP requires states to obligate FY2026 funds by September 30, 2027: approximately 21 months from award announcement to obligation deadline. Standard state procurement processes for major contracts typically require 12 to 18 months from needs assessment to contract execution. The math does not work. States that follow standard procurement timelines may fail to obligate funds before deadlines, losing both the money and credibility for future awards.

### What Would Resolve the Tension

Evidence could inform this debate but largely does not exist. **Comparative analysis of procurement approaches and implementation outcomes would clarify which methods work.** Do states using streamlined procurement achieve better or worse implementation results than states using full competitive processes? Do sole-source contracts produce higher or lower vendor performance than competitively awarded contracts? Does procurement timeline predict implementation quality?

These questions remain unanswered because **states track procurement process compliance, not procurement outcome quality.** Audit functions verify that procedures were followed, not that procedures produced good results. The compliance orientation of procurement oversight creates the compliance orientation of procurement practice.

### Why the Tension Cannot Be Fully Resolved

Process compliance and outcome achievement exist in genuine tension that cannot be fully resolved. **Any procurement system involves tradeoffs.** Faster processes increase implementation risk. More thorough evaluations extend timelines. Greater flexibility enables both better adaptation and worse favoritism. No process design eliminates all failure modes.

The political economy of procurement reinforces process orientation. **Officials face asymmetric consequences.** Procurement scandals end careers. Implementation delays generate criticism but rarely remove officials from positions. A rational bureaucrat prioritizes avoiding scandal over accelerating implementation, even when slower procurement produces worse outcomes for communities.

## Federal Framework

### CMS Requirements for RHTP Procurement

CMS administers RHTP through cooperative agreements governed by 45 CFR Part 75, HHS's implementation of the Uniform Administrative Requirements. **Key procurement requirements include:**

**Competition requirements.** Recipients must conduct procurement transactions in a manner providing full and open competition consistent with standards in 45 CFR 75.328. Procurement by noncompetitive proposals (sole source) is permitted only when specific conditions apply: the item is available only from a single source, public emergency precludes competitive solicitation, CMS authorizes noncompetitive procurement, or after solicitation from several sources competition is determined inadequate.

**Conflict of interest provisions.** Recipients must maintain written standards of conduct covering conflicts of interest and governing actions of employees engaged in selection, award, and administration of contracts. No employee or agent may participate in selection when a real or apparent conflict exists.

**Documentation requirements.** Recipients must maintain records sufficient to detail the history of procurement, including rationale for method of procurement, selection of contract type, contractor selection or rejection, and basis for contract price.

**Cost and price analysis.** Recipients must perform cost or price analysis for every procurement action exceeding the Simplified Acquisition Threshold (currently $250,000) to determine reasonableness of proposed contract price.

### Federal Requirements Layered on State Requirements

**RHTP procurement involves dual compliance.** States must satisfy both federal requirements under 45 CFR Part 75 and their own state procurement laws and regulations. Where state requirements are more stringent than federal requirements, states must follow state requirements. Where federal requirements are more stringent, federal requirements govern.

This dual system creates complexity. **State procurement officials must understand both rule sets and identify which applies in each situation.** Federal rules may permit approaches that state rules prohibit. State rules may require processes that federal rules do not mandate. Navigating the intersection requires procurement expertise that many state health agencies lack.

### Where Federal Flexibility Exists

Federal rules provide more flexibility than many states utilize. **45 CFR 75.329 explicitly permits procurement by noncompetitive proposals when:**

The item is available only from a single source. For specialized health information technology or transformation consulting, states can legitimately document that only one vendor possesses the required capabilities.

A public emergency exists requiring immediate action. Implementation deadlines could constitute emergencies requiring expedited procurement, though this interpretation remains legally untested.

CMS expressly authorizes noncompetitive procurement in response to written request. States can request and receive CMS authorization for sole-source contracting when justified.

After soliciting from a number of sources, competition is determined inadequate. Markets with few qualified vendors may not support competitive procurement.

**States rarely utilize these flexibilities** because procurement officials face greater career risk from audit findings than from slow implementation. The asymmetric consequences of process deviation discourage flexibility use even when flexibility would improve outcomes.

### Unintended Consequences of Federal Specifications

Federal procurement requirements assume markets with multiple qualified vendors competing on price and capability. **Rural health transformation markets often lack these characteristics.**

Vendor concentration means limited competition. For specialized services like telehealth platform development or community health worker training program design, few vendors possess relevant rural experience. Competitive procurement among unqualified vendors produces compliant processes and inadequate outcomes.

**Geographic constraints narrow vendor pools further.** Vendors must often deploy staff to rural areas for implementation support. National vendors without rural presence may win contracts they cannot effectively execute. Local vendors with relevant experience may lack capacity for statewide contracts.

The federal emphasis on cost efficiency conflicts with quality requirements. **Low-cost vendors may provide low-quality services.** Procurement processes that weight cost heavily may select vendors whose bids are low because their capabilities are limited. States then face the choice of accepting inadequate performance or terminating contracts and restarting procurement.

## State Procurement Approaches

States have adopted varied approaches to RHTP procurement, reflecting different assessments of the compliance versus outcome tradeoff. Analysis identifies four primary patterns.

### Procurement Approach Assessment

| Approach | Characteristics | Example States | Timeline | Outcome Quality | Compliance Risk |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Full Competitive** | Standard RFP process for all major contracts | Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York | 12 to 18 months | Unknown (process focused) | Low |
| **Pre-Positioned Contracts** | Award through existing master agreements | California, Texas, Florida | 3 to 6 months | Variable | Low |
| **Expedited Competitive** | Shortened timelines, streamlined evaluation | North Carolina, Virginia | 6 to 9 months | Promising | Moderate |
| **Sole Source with Justification** | Direct vendor selection with documented rationale | Several smaller states | 1 to 2 months | Depends on selection quality | Higher |

### Full Competitive Procurement

**States following standard procurement processes** apply the same rules to RHTP contracts that govern other major state purchases. This approach involves formal needs assessment, RFP development with detailed specifications, public posting periods, vendor conferences, proposal submission windows, evaluation committee review, scoring against predetermined criteria, award recommendations, protest periods, contract negotiation, and execution.

**Ohio exemplifies this approach.** The Ohio Department of Health is conducting full competitive procurement for RHTP technology platforms and implementation partners. The process follows standard Department of Administrative Services rules, with RFP posting on the state procurement portal, minimum 30-day response periods, and formal evaluation committees.

The approach has advantages. **Audit risk is minimal** when states follow established procedures. Documentation accumulates naturally through the standard process. Political criticism of favoritism is deflected by demonstrable competition.

The approach has significant disadvantages. **Timeline collision with RHTP obligation requirements is nearly certain.** Ohio's FY2026 allocation of $202 million must be obligated by September 2027. Full competitive procurement for major contracts, initiated in early 2026, may not produce executed contracts until late 2026 or 2027, leaving minimal time for actual implementation before obligation deadlines.

### Pre-Positioned Contracts

**States utilizing pre-positioned contracts** award RHTP work through existing master service agreements, cooperative purchasing arrangements, or previously competed vendor pools. These mechanisms enable rapid contracting because vendor qualification occurred through prior competitive processes.

**California has leveraged existing state contracts** for technology components of RHTP implementation. The Department of Health Care Access and Information can issue task orders against pre-positioned IT contracts, reducing procurement timeline from months to weeks. CalHIE Network and existing telehealth infrastructure vendors received RHTP-related work through existing agreements.

**Texas similarly utilizes standing contracts** with vendors qualified through prior competitive processes. The Health and Human Services Commission maintains master agreements with technology vendors, consulting firms, and training organizations that can be applied to RHTP implementation without new procurement.

The approach accelerates implementation while maintaining compliance. **Pre-positioned contracts were competitively awarded**, satisfying competition requirements. Documentation of the original procurement supports current task orders. Audit risk remains low because the procurement method is defensible.

The approach has limitations. **Pre-positioned vendor pools may not include vendors best suited to transformation work.** Contracts established for general IT services or consulting may not have contemplated rural health transformation. Vendor capabilities reflected in standing contracts may not align with RHTP needs.

### Expedited Competitive Procurement

**Some states have developed accelerated competitive procurement processes** specifically for time-sensitive grant implementation. These approaches maintain competitive principles while compressing timelines through parallel processing, streamlined evaluation, and reduced bureaucratic steps.

**North Carolina has implemented expedited procurement** for RHTP technology and services. The Department of Health and Human Services compressed RFP development, shortened posting periods where legally permissible, conducted evaluation committee work in parallel with proposal submission, and delegated approval authority to reduce decision bottlenecks.

**Virginia similarly established expedited processes** through emergency procurement authorities available for time-limited federal grants. The approach enables competitive selection while meeting implementation deadlines.

The approach represents a middle path. **Competition occurs, but on compressed timelines.** Vendor evaluation happens, but with fewer steps. Documentation is maintained, but process phases overlap.

Compliance risk is moderate. **Expedited processes may face challenge** if unsuccessful bidders allege insufficient evaluation time or inadequate competition. States must document the basis for expedited treatment and ensure fundamental fairness even with compressed timelines.

### Sole Source with Justification

**Several states have selected vendors directly** without competitive procurement, documenting justifications under federal and state exceptions. This approach produces the fastest contracting but carries the highest compliance risk.

Common justifications include **single-source availability** (only one vendor possesses required capabilities), **continuity requirements** (existing vendors must be retained to maintain service), and **time constraints** (procurement timelines would preclude meeting federal deadlines).

The approach enables immediate implementation. **Contracts can execute within weeks** of identification of qualified vendors. Implementation begins while states using competitive processes are still developing RFPs.

Compliance risk is substantial. **Auditors may question sole-source justifications**, particularly if competitors can demonstrate equivalent capabilities. Federal monitors may require additional documentation or impose enhanced oversight. Political opponents may allege favoritism regardless of legitimate justification.

### Why States Chose Different Approaches

State procurement approach selection reflects multiple factors beyond simple compliance versus outcome assessment.

**Procurement culture varies.** States with histories of procurement scandal maintain rigorous processes regardless of implementation consequences. States without recent scandal have more flexibility to streamline.

**Legal frameworks differ.** Some state procurement codes permit emergency or expedited processes for time-limited federal grants. Others require statutory change to enable flexibility.

**Political context matters.** Governors facing competitive elections may prefer slower compliant processes to faster processes that create political vulnerability. Lame-duck administrations may accept higher risk to demonstrate implementation progress.

**Capacity constraints shape options.** States lacking procurement staff to manage multiple simultaneous competitive processes may use pre-positioned contracts by necessity. States with robust procurement operations can handle full competitive processes.

## The Procurement Paradox in Practice

The following vignette illustrates how procurement rules designed to ensure quality can produce the opposite result.

### Vignette: The RFP That Delivered Yesterday's Technology

**In January 2026, a large Southeastern state began procurement for a statewide care coordination platform to support RHTP innovation hub implementation.** The state followed its standard procurement process, beginning with needs assessment workshops with clinical and technical stakeholders.

By March 2026, the procurement office had translated stakeholder input into detailed specifications. **The RFP described a comprehensive platform** with care coordination workflows, closed-loop referral capabilities, integration with electronic health records, remote patient monitoring connectivity, and analytics dashboards. Specifications reflected cutting-edge capabilities as understood in early 2026.

**The RFP posted in April 2026** with a 45-day response period. Thirteen vendors submitted proposals. The evaluation committee, comprising clinical leaders, technical staff, and procurement specialists, began review in June.

**Evaluation proceeded methodically.** Committee members scored proposals independently against predetermined criteria. Interviews with finalist vendors occurred in July. Reference checks extended into August. The committee recommended award in September 2026.

**Protests from two unsuccessful vendors delayed contract execution until November 2026.** The protest period and resolution process added ten weeks to the timeline.

**Contract negotiation required another three months.** The selected vendor sought modifications to liability provisions, data ownership terms, and implementation timelines. State attorneys reviewed each proposed change. Final contract execution occurred in February 2027.

**Implementation planning began in March 2027.** The vendor conducted discovery sessions to understand state systems, hub sites, and integration requirements. Project plans were developed. Staff were assigned.

**When deployment began in July 2027, the technology landscape had shifted.** Capabilities that were advanced in early 2026 had become standard. New integration protocols had emerged that the platform did not support. Competitor platforms offered features the selected vendor could not match. The state had procured the technology of 18 months prior, not the technology of implementation day.

**The state was fully compliant.** Every procedure was followed. Every documentation requirement was met. Every timeline was defensible. And the platform delivered was already obsolescent.

**This is the procurement paradox.** Rules designed to ensure quality can lock in specifications that become outdated during lengthy procurement timelines. States receive what they asked for rather than what they need. Process compliance substitutes for outcome achievement.

## Alternative Perspectives

### The Political Economy View

The political economy perspective argues that **procurement rules exist less to ensure quality than to provide political cover.** Officials use rigorous processes to deflect criticism, demonstrate fairness, and create accountability trails. The processes serve bureaucratic interests in risk avoidance more than public interests in outcome achievement.

**Evidence supporting this view:**

Procurement timelines expand when political risk increases. States facing media scrutiny or partisan conflict extend processes to demonstrate thoroughness.

Process compliance receives more attention than outcome quality. Auditors verify procedures were followed; they rarely assess whether procedures produced good results.

Officials who streamline procurement face greater career consequences than officials whose compliant processes produce poor outcomes.

**Evidence against this view:**

Procurement scandals do occur when controls are weak. States that abandon competitive processes sometimes experience favoritism, corruption, and waste.

Taxpayers benefit from documented processes that enable oversight, even when oversight rarely occurs.

Some rigorous procurement produces genuinely superior vendor selection.

**Assessment:** The political economy view has substantial validity. Procurement processes serve multiple functions, and risk avoidance for officials ranks prominently among them. However, dismissing all process requirements as mere political theater overstates the case. The challenge is distinguishing requirements that genuinely protect public interests from requirements that primarily protect bureaucratic interests.

### The Transformation Impossibility View

Some observers argue that **procurement systems are fundamentally incompatible with transformation**. Procurement assumes purchasers know what they need and can specify requirements in advance. Transformation involves learning, adaptation, and emergence. The attempt to procure transformation through standard processes guarantees failure.

**Evidence supporting this view:**

Transformation programs require flexibility that procurement contracts rarely permit. Specifications locked in at contract award may prove inappropriate as implementation reveals unexpected conditions.

Innovation requires experimentation and iteration. Procurement processes select vendors based on proposed approaches rather than demonstrated capability to adapt.

True transformation may require changing vendors mid-implementation as needs evolve. Contract structures make vendor changes expensive and disruptive.

**Evidence against this view:**

Some transformation has occurred through procured services. Not all procurement produces stagnation.

The alternative to procured transformation is unclear. Direct state implementation would face different but potentially greater obstacles.

**Assessment:** The critique has merit but may be overstated. Procurement processes can accommodate some flexibility through well-designed contracts, change order provisions, and phase-gated implementations. The question is whether procurement can adapt sufficiently, not whether procurement is categorically incompatible with transformation.

### The Corruption Prevention Priority View

Others argue that **preventing corruption must take precedence over accelerating implementation**. Public trust in government depends on fair processes. Streamlined procurement, whatever its efficiency benefits, undermines confidence that public funds serve public purposes.

**Evidence supporting this view:**

Procurement scandals generate headlines; implementation delays rarely do. Public perception responds more to process fairness than outcome achievement.

Once corruption becomes established, reversing it proves extraordinarily difficult. Prevention through rigorous processes is more effective than prosecution after the fact.

Rural communities have often been victimized by public officials prioritizing connected interests over community needs. Rigorous procurement protects vulnerable communities from exploitation.

**Evidence against this view:**

Rigid procurement has not prevented corruption, only changed its forms. Well-connected vendors learn to win competitive processes through superior proposal writing rather than superior performance.

Communities harmed by corruption are also harmed by slow implementation. Preventing one harm while enabling another does not serve community interests.

**Assessment:** The prevention priority view reflects legitimate concerns but may overestimate procurement's effectiveness at preventing corruption while underestimating its costs. Both corruption and slow implementation harm communities. The question is which failure mode is more manageable.

## Implications for RHTP

### Where Procurement Threatens Implementation

**States at highest risk of procurement-induced implementation failure** combine several characteristics: rigid procurement codes that prohibit expedited processes, limited pre-positioned contracts applicable to RHTP work, weak relationships with CMS that preclude flexibility requests, and large allocations requiring major procurements rather than small direct awards.

Specific concerns exist in states pursuing statewide technology platforms through full competitive procurement. **The timeline arithmetic is unforgiving.** RFP development requires three to six months. Posting and response periods require one to two months. Evaluation requires two to four months. Protests can add two to three months. Contract negotiation requires two to four months. States beginning full competitive procurement in early 2026 may not execute contracts until late 2026 or 2027.

**Subaward distribution presents similar challenges.** States that must competitively select hub sites, intermediary organizations, or direct provider recipients face procurement timelines for each selection. Even if each procurement is relatively brief, cumulative timelines can exceed implementation windows.

### Which Approaches Evidence Supports

**Available evidence, though limited, suggests that pre-positioned contracts and expedited competitive processes produce better implementation outcomes than full competitive procurement or unstructured sole source selection.**

Pre-positioned contracts offer speed without compliance risk. States that invested in vendor qualification prior to RHTP implementation can deploy quickly while maintaining audit defensibility.

Expedited competitive processes maintain competition's benefits while compressing timelines. States that developed expedited procedures appear to be achieving implementation progress while managing compliance concerns.

Full competitive procurement, while compliance-optimal, appears likely to produce timeline failures in multiple states. The outcomes will depend on whether CMS accommodates states that followed proper procedures but missed deadlines.

Unstructured sole source selection creates compliance vulnerability without guaranteeing implementation quality. Outcomes depend entirely on selection quality, which is difficult to assess in advance.

### Warning Signs of Procurement-Induced Failure

**Observable indicators suggest when procurement will prevent successful implementation:**

Procurement timelines that exceed time from current date to obligation deadline. Simple arithmetic identifies states where compliance-adherent procurement cannot succeed.

Multiple sequential procurements required before implementation can begin. States that must procure technology, then procure intermediary partners, then procure provider participants face cumulative timeline compression.

Procurement staff unfamiliar with federal grant requirements. State procurement offices oriented toward general purchasing may not understand federal flexibilities or cooperative agreement requirements.

Political context discouraging streamlined approaches. States facing election-year scrutiny or recent scandal may pursue slow compliant processes regardless of implementation consequences.

### What Expedited Procurement Requires

**States seeking to accelerate procurement while maintaining defensibility should consider:**

Documentation of urgency. Federal obligation deadlines provide legitimate basis for expedited treatment. States should formally document timeline constraints and their basis in federal requirements.

Pre-qualification of vendor pools. Advance competitive qualification of vendors enables rapid task order issuance without new procurement.

Parallel processing. Conducting evaluation while proposals are still being received, negotiating contracts while protests are pending, and other parallel activities compress timelines without eliminating steps.

Delegated authority. Procurement approval requirements often create bottlenecks. Delegating approval authority to program officials for grant-funded contracts reduces decision delays.

CMS engagement. Early communication with CMS project officers about procurement approaches enables flexibility requests before problems emerge.

## Recommendations

### For State Agencies

**Assess procurement timelines immediately.** Calculate time required for planned procurements and compare to obligation deadlines. Where timelines are incompatible, identify alternatives before compliance failures become inevitable.

**Utilize pre-positioned contracts where applicable.** Review existing master service agreements, cooperative purchasing arrangements, and qualified vendor pools. Where current contracts can support RHTP work, use them rather than initiating new procurement.

**Request expedited treatment proactively.** States with procurement codes permitting expedited processes for time-limited federal grants should formally invoke those provisions. States without such provisions should seek emergency authority or legislative action.

**Document everything.** Whatever procurement approach is selected, comprehensive documentation protects against future challenge. Record the basis for procurement method selection, timeline constraints, and any deviations from standard process.

**Engage CMS early.** Project officers can provide guidance on procurement flexibility, approve sole-source justifications, and help navigate compliance requirements. States that wait until problems emerge have fewer options.

### For CMS

**Clarify procurement flexibility explicitly.** Issue guidance specifically addressing RHTP procurement timelines, available flexibilities, and acceptable justifications for expedited treatment.

**Accommodate compliant states that miss deadlines due to procurement.** States that followed proper procedures but cannot complete procurement before obligation deadlines should not face the same consequences as states that simply failed to act.

**Reduce compliance burden that slows implementation.** Review whether all current procurement documentation requirements genuinely serve oversight needs. Eliminate requirements that create burden without generating useful information.

**Consider pre-qualified vendor pools for transformation services.** CMS could competitively qualify vendors for specific transformation capabilities, enabling states to select from pre-qualified pools without additional procurement.

### For Evaluators and Observers

**Track procurement timeline as implementation predictor.** Procurement approach and timeline should be included in state implementation assessments. States pursuing lengthy procurement processes may be at risk regardless of other factors.

**Assess outcome quality, not just process compliance.** Evaluation should examine whether procurement produced effective vendors and successful implementation, not merely whether procedures were followed.

**Distinguish procurement failures from implementation failures.** States that fail to implement due to procurement obstacles face different challenges than states that procure successfully but implement poorly. Diagnosis matters for remedy.

## Transition to Article 5D

Procurement determines who implements RHTP. Performance measurement determines how implementation is assessed. **Article 5D examines the tension between accountability and capacity** in state measurement approaches. States that lack capacity to implement effectively may also lack capacity to measure accurately. Holding under-resourced states accountable for measurement requirements they cannot meet raises the same questions that arise in holding states accountable for procurement timelines they cannot achieve. The compliance orientation that shapes procurement also shapes measurement, often with similar consequences.

## Cross-References

**5A (Lead Agency Structures):** Authority for procurement decisions varies by lead agency designation. Medicaid agencies often have more procurement flexibility than health departments.

**5B (Stakeholder Coordination):** Stakeholder coordination approaches affect procurement. States using intermediaries as subawardees face different procurement requirements than states contracting directly with providers.

**5D (Performance Measurement):** Performance measurement systems often require procurement. States may face the same timeline challenges for measurement infrastructure that they face for implementation infrastructure.

**5E (Federal-State Relationship):** Relationship quality with CMS affects procurement flexibility. Collaborative relationships enable flexibility requests; adversarial relationships limit options.

**6A-F (Intermediaries):** Intermediary organizations are often selected through procurement. Series 6 examines which intermediaries receive subawards and how they were selected.

**7A-H (Providers):** Providers experience state procurement both as subawardees seeking state contracts and as subrecipients selecting their own vendors.
