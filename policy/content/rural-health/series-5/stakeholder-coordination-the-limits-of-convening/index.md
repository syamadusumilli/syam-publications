State RHTP applications document extensive stakeholder engagement: advisory committees with provider representatives, listening sessions in rural communities, consultation meetings with tribal governments, interagency coordination structures involving multiple cabinet agencies. The documentation demonstrates compliance with CMS requirements. **Whether it demonstrates actual coordination is a different question.**

Coordination can mean many things. It can mean state agencies talking to each other before making decisions. It can mean providers advising state officials who then decide autonomously. It can mean communities setting direction that agencies implement. The same word describes radically different power arrangements, and the difference matters for transformation outcomes.

This article examines the tension between centralized efficiency and local knowledge, assessing which coordination approaches produce implementation that works. The core finding: **most state coordination structures concentrate decision-making at the state level while creating appearance of distributed input**. Communities participate; they do not decide. Providers advise; they do not govern. The coordination theater satisfies CMS documentation requirements while leaving actual authority undisturbed.

Some states demonstrate alternatives. Regional networks with genuine decision authority. Community governance structures where rural residents direct investment. Provider collaboratives that shape rather than react to state priorities. These exceptions prove both that alternatives are possible and that they remain exceptional.

## The Fundamental Tension

### Centralized Control

**The efficiency argument for centralization:** State agencies have analytical capacity, cross-regional perspective, and compliance expertise that local entities lack. Centralizing decisions prevents duplication, ensures consistency, and maintains accountability to federal requirements. Someone must decide; agencies with professional staff and statewide mandate are positioned to decide well.

Centralization also protects against capture. Local health systems, provider organizations, and influential community members may dominate distributed decision processes, directing public investment toward private benefit. State oversight can resist pressures that local bodies cannot.

**The limitation:** State capital agencies operate at geographic and social distance from rural communities. Staff who analyze data and write plans may never have visited the communities their plans affect. The professional perspective that enables analytical rigor also creates disconnection from lived experience.

### Local Knowledge

**The legitimacy argument for distribution:** Transformation requires community trust that centralized bureaucracies cannot command. Rural residents know their communities better than distant officials. Local providers understand patient needs, workforce constraints, and institutional histories that state data systems cannot capture. Effective implementation requires local adaptation that central direction cannot achieve.

Distributed authority also builds ownership. Communities that shape decisions invest in outcomes. Providers who participate in design implement more effectively than those handed plans they did not create. The process of coordination itself generates commitment that efficient centralization cannot replicate.

**The limitation:** Local knowledge is local. Communities may not see regional patterns. Providers may advocate for institutional interests rather than population health. Distributed decision-making can fragment investment, duplicate effort, and resist coordination that regional transformation requires.

### The Unresolvable Tension

Neither centralization nor distribution is inherently superior. **The question is which decisions benefit from which approach.** Compliance with federal reporting requirements benefits from centralization; agencies with compliance expertise can navigate CMS requirements more efficiently than distributed local bodies. Community engagement benefits from distribution; local organizations have relationships and trust that state agencies cannot manufacture.

Most states resolve the tension by centralizing substantive decisions while distributing ceremonial participation. Advisory committees meet; state agencies decide. Listening sessions occur; applications reflect state priorities developed before listening began. The structure appears collaborative while authority remains concentrated.

## Federal Requirements

### CMS Coordination Expectations

The RHTP Notice of Funding Opportunity requires documented stakeholder engagement including:

- **State Medicaid Agency consultation:** Mandatory regardless of lead agency designation
- **State Office of Rural Health consultation:** Required to ensure integration with existing rural health programs
- **Tribal consultation:** Required in states with federally recognized tribes
- **Provider stakeholder engagement:** Must demonstrate input from hospitals, clinics, and practitioners
- **Community stakeholder engagement:** Must show participation from community organizations and residents

CMS evaluates whether stakeholder input **meaningfully shaped proposed activities or merely provided political cover for predetermined plans**. The standard acknowledges that consultation can be genuine or performative but provides limited mechanisms to distinguish between them.

### What Federal Requirements Cannot See

Documentation demonstrates process: meetings held, comments received, participants listed. Documentation cannot demonstrate whether input changed anything. A state can conduct extensive listening sessions, compile comprehensive comment summaries, and submit an application unchanged from what staff drafted before engagement began. The documentation shows process; it cannot show influence.

CMS reviews applications, not implementation. A state that documented robust stakeholder engagement may implement through channels that exclude the stakeholders who participated in application development. The advisory committee that shaped the application may never meet again once funds are awarded.

### Requirements That Create Coordination Burden

Federal requirements assume coordination capacity that many states lack. Meaningful engagement with multiple stakeholder categories, documentation of input and response, and demonstration of how engagement shaped plans require staff time, convening infrastructure, and analytical capacity to synthesize diverse perspectives.

States with limited capacity may satisfy requirements through minimal compliance rather than genuine engagement. The listing session with twenty attendees satisfies documentation requirements regardless of whether twenty people spoke or one person spoke while nineteen observed. The advisory committee meets the structural requirement whether it directs decisions or ratifies them.

## Coordination Model Assessment

State approaches to stakeholder coordination cluster into identifiable patterns with different implications for the tension between centralized control and local knowledge.

| Model | Characteristics | Approximate States | Community Voice | Implementation Quality | Evidence Base |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|----------------------|---------------|
| **Centralized Hierarchy** | Lead agency decides; others inform | 18 | Minimal: input without influence | Efficient but disconnected | Mixed: fast but misaligned |
| **Advisory Board** | Formal stakeholder body advises | 20 | Performative: seats without power | Depends on board authority | Weak: process not outcomes |
| **Regional Networks** | Distributed decision-making to regions | 8 | Variable: depends on regional governance | Adaptation vs. consistency | Promising but limited |
| **Community Governance** | Community members with actual authority | 4 | Strong: binding input on decisions | Unknown at scale | Insufficient |

### Centralized Hierarchy

The most common model places **decision authority at the lead agency** with stakeholder input flowing upward through consultation channels. The lead agency convenes meetings, collects input, and decides. Stakeholders participate in the process without participating in the decision.

Texas exemplifies this approach. HHSC coordinates with DSHS, the Office of Rural Health, TORCH (the rural hospital association), academic medical centers, and AHECs. The application documents extensive stakeholder engagement. **Implementation authority rests entirely with HHSC.** Partner organizations advise; HHSC decides. Communities participate through listening sessions and comment processes; they do not govern any aspect of implementation.

The centralized model serves efficiency. Single decision authority enables rapid action, consistent application of criteria, and clear accountability. When CMS asks who decided, the answer is unambiguous. When problems arise, responsibility is clear.

But centralization concentrates transformation decisions at geographic and institutional distance from affected communities. The officials making decisions may have never visited the counties their decisions affect. The professional expertise that enables sophisticated planning also creates disconnection from lived experience that planning cannot capture.

**States favoring centralized hierarchy often cite:**
- Need for rapid implementation to meet RHTP timelines
- Limited local capacity that would slow distributed decision-making
- Prior experience with fragmented programs that lacked coordination
- Federal accountability requirements that demand clear decision authority

**Critics note:**
- Communities develop distrust when decisions are made to them rather than with them
- Local knowledge gets filtered through layers that may distort or lose it
- Implementation encounters resistance that earlier engagement might have prevented
- Sustainability requires community ownership that centralized processes cannot create

### Advisory Board Model

Many states create **formal advisory structures** that convene stakeholder representatives on a regular basis. Rhode Island's governance architecture includes an Executive Committee, an Interagency Leadership Team, a Project Management Team, and a Rural Stakeholder Advisory Committee. The layered structure suggests distributed authority.

Examination reveals advisory rather than governance function. The Executive Committee provides strategic oversight; the Project Management Team makes operational decisions. The Rural Stakeholder Advisory Committee, which includes patients, residents, and community organizations, provides input and implementation guidance. **The committee advises; it does not decide.**

This pattern recurs across states. Stakeholder advisory committees meet quarterly, receive updates on implementation progress, offer feedback on emerging issues, and document community perspective. The meeting minutes satisfy CMS engagement requirements. The committees lack authority to direct, approve, or veto state decisions.

Ohio's advisory structure illustrates the pattern. Multiple stakeholder bodies contribute to RHTP governance: provider advisory groups, community health assessment processes, regional planning entities. Each contributes perspective; none holds authority that constrains lead agency decisions. The Director of Health can consider advisory input and decide otherwise.

Connecticut similarly layers advisory functions across governance tiers. The Office of Health Strategy coordinates AHEAD model implementation; DSS leads RHTP. Advisory committees exist at multiple levels. Authority concentrates at the Executive Committee level, where Governor's Office and agency secretaries hold actual decision power.

Advisory structures can evolve toward governance. A committee that begins as advisory may accumulate influence as relationships develop and trust builds. Members who demonstrate expertise and judgment may find their advice increasingly followed even without formal authority. **But the formal structure positions communities as consultants rather than governors, and evolution toward governance depends on agency willingness to cede power rather than structural requirement to share it.**

### Regional Network Model

Eight states have established **regional coordination structures with genuine decision authority** over some implementation aspects. Washington's organization through The Rural Collaborative and regional health systems distributes coordination to geographic areas with distinct needs and relationships.

Washington's 55 public hospital districts create governance infrastructure at the regional level. Each district has locally elected trustees who control hospital operations and can shape RHTP implementation within their boundaries. The state role becomes coordination across districts rather than direction of district decisions.

Michigan's regional hub development creates infrastructure for distributed coordination, though the model remains early in implementation. The four-initiative framework positions regional hubs as coordination points with authority to adapt implementation to regional circumstances. Whether that authority becomes meaningful depends on how hub relationships develop.

North Carolina's regional AHEC networks have decades of experience coordinating workforce development and provider support across defined territories. The network structure predates RHTP and provides established relationships and governance mechanisms that newer regional approaches lack.

Regional models trade consistency for adaptation. Different regions may implement differently, creating variation that complicates statewide evaluation and may produce inequitable outcomes across geography. A region with strong provider relationships may secure more resources than a region with weaker connections, regardless of relative need.

**The evidence on regional models is promising but limited.** States with regional coordination show stronger provider engagement in some assessments, but rigorous comparison with centralized models is scarce. The variation itself makes evaluation difficult: regional models differ enough that findings from one state may not transfer to others.

### Community Governance Model

Four states have created structures where **community members hold actual decision authority** over some RHTP functions. These models go beyond advisory participation to binding community voice on investment priorities, subawardee selection, or program design.

Oregon's coordinated care organizations include community advisory councils with formal authority over community health improvement priorities. The councils do not merely advise CCOs; they approve community health improvement plans that CCOs must implement. The authority is bounded but real.

Alaska's tribal health system integration provides governance mechanisms where tribal communities direct health system decisions. Tribal health organizations governed by tribal councils control substantial healthcare resources. RHTP flows through tribal governance where tribal authority applies.

New Mexico's community health councils have historically shaped regional health planning, though their RHTP integration varies by region. Some councils have established relationships with state agencies that create genuine influence; others function more as advisory bodies despite similar formal structures.

Hawaii's unique geographic and demographic context enables community governance approaches that larger, more dispersed states cannot replicate. The state's single health system serving multiple islands creates community-scale units where governance mechanisms can function.

**Community governance models face implementation challenges.** Community members may lack technical expertise to evaluate complex proposals. Participation requires time that working residents may not have. Dominant voices may capture community bodies as effectively as provider interests capture advisory committees. Meeting schedules may exclude those who cannot take time from work.

The evidence base for community governance in health transformation is **insufficient to assess effectiveness at scale**. Promising examples exist; systematic evaluation does not. States implementing community governance are experimenting rather than applying proven models.

## Vignette: Two Advisory Committees

The Rural Health Stakeholder Advisory Committee meets quarterly in both states. Both committees include hospital administrators, clinic directors, community organization representatives, and rural residents. Both committees receive implementation updates and provide feedback. The formal structures are identical. The actual dynamics diverge completely.

**In State A**, the committee meets in a conference room at the state health department. Agency staff present PowerPoint slides summarizing implementation progress, subaward allocations, and upcoming initiatives. After each presentation, the chair asks if anyone has questions. Hospital administrators ask clarifying questions about reporting requirements. Community representatives sit silently. The meeting adjourns in 90 minutes with action items assigned entirely to agency staff.

When a rural hospital CEO later calls the RHTP Program Director to advocate for modified subaward criteria, the conversation matters. The CEO serves on the committee; the relationship provides access. The advocacy may shift decisions. But the advocacy occurs outside the committee, through individual relationships rather than collective governance.

**In State B**, the committee meets at a community center in a rural county seat, rotating locations across the state's rural regions. The agenda opens with community member reports: what health challenges their communities face, what implementation they have observed, what they believe should change. Agency staff listen and take notes.

When the agenda turns to upcoming subaward decisions, community members ask pointed questions. Why does the proposed allocation favor hospital systems over community clinics? How were community needs assessed? What happens to communities without strong provider relationships? The discussion extends past scheduled time. The Program Director commits to revising allocation criteria based on committee input and returning with modified proposals at the next meeting.

When the Director returns to the state capital, the committee discussion shapes staff work. The revised criteria reflect community concerns. The final allocation differs from what staff originally proposed. The committee did not merely advise; it influenced.

**Same structure, opposite dynamics.** What creates the difference?

Location matters: meeting in rural communities rather than the state capital signals whose space the conversation occupies. Agenda structure matters: beginning with community reports rather than agency presentations establishes whose perspective frames discussion. But most fundamentally, **whether agency staff believe the committee should influence decisions** determines whether it does. The structure enables; the culture determines.

State B's culture did not emerge spontaneously. The RHTP Program Director spent months building relationships with community members before the first committee meeting. Agency staff attended community events, visited rural health facilities, and listened before asking for committee participation. The investment in relationship preceded the structure that makes relationship visible.

State A's committee will meet quarterly for five years, satisfying CMS requirements and documenting stakeholder engagement. State B's committee will shape implementation in ways that State A's never will. CMS documentation cannot distinguish between them.

## Alternative Perspective: The Community Accountability Gap

### The Argument

Most RHTP coordination structures answer to agencies and funders, not communities. Rural residents have no meaningful voice in implementation decisions affecting their lives. Advisory participation is performative: communities speak, agencies decide. **Transformation requires accountability to communities that current structures do not provide.**

The gap persists because accountability flows with resources. CMS holds states accountable for federal funds. States hold subawardees accountable for state awards. No one holds anyone accountable to communities. Residents can complain; they cannot compel.

True community accountability would require structures where communities approve budgets, select subawardees, and evaluate outcomes with authority to redirect implementation. Such structures exist in community development finance, participatory budgeting, and some tribal governance arrangements. They remain rare in healthcare.

### Evidence Assessment

**Evidence supporting this critique is substantial.** Across 50 state RHTP applications, advisory structures predominate while governance structures remain exceptional. Community representatives appear on stakeholder lists; they rarely appear in decision flowcharts. The pattern is consistent enough to constitute system design rather than implementation variation.

Research on health program stakeholder engagement consistently finds that participation does not equal influence. Studies of community advisory boards across health programs show that boards meet, members attend, and decisions emerge from processes that members do not control. The correlation between community participation and community influence is weak.

**Evidence against the critique is limited but important.** Some states have created meaningful community authority. Oregon's coordinated care organization model includes community voice with formal decision rights. Tribal health governance in multiple states demonstrates that community accountability structures can function in healthcare contexts. The examples prove that alternatives are possible, even if they remain exceptional.

**Assessment:** The community accountability gap critique is largely accurate. Most stakeholder coordination is performative, creating appearance of community input without creating mechanisms for community authority. States that want transformation must address this gap, but doing so requires structural change that advisory committees cannot provide.

## Implications for RHTP

### Where Coordination Adds Value

**Interagency alignment:** RHTP implementation touches Medicaid payment policy, workforce development, public health infrastructure, and social services. No single agency controls all relevant domains. Coordination that aligns agencies toward common objectives reduces working at cross-purposes.

**Regional adaptation:** Statewide programs benefit from regional differentiation. Coordination structures that enable local adaptation while maintaining statewide coherence improve fit between programs and community needs.

**Stakeholder trust:** Transformation requires provider and community cooperation that state agencies cannot compel. Coordination that builds trust creates implementation capacity that hierarchical direction cannot.

### Where Coordination Becomes Overhead

**Meeting multiplication:** Coordination structures can generate meetings without generating decisions. When stakeholders spend time preparing for, attending, and following up from meetings that do not influence outcomes, coordination costs exceed benefits.

**Accountability diffusion:** Distributed coordination can obscure who decides and who is responsible. When decisions emerge from processes that no one controls, accountability for outcomes becomes unclear. CMS single-agency accountability model exists precisely because shared accountability often means no accountability.

**Process substitution:** Coordination processes can substitute for substantive progress. States may invest extensively in convening stakeholders while substantive implementation stalls. The activity of coordination creates appearance of progress regardless of actual advancement.

### Warning Signs of Coordination Theater

**Community silence:** Meetings where community representatives do not speak suggest structures that do not invite community voice. Silence may indicate intimidation, irrelevance, or learned futility.

**Agenda control:** When agency staff control agendas, frame issues, and propose options, stakeholder input occurs within parameters that staff define. The consultation is genuine within its scope; the scope itself reflects centralized control.

**Unchanging decisions:** If stakeholder input never changes agency plans, coordination is documentation rather than governance. Genuine coordination produces decisions that differ from what any single party would choose alone.

**Meeting frequency substituting for authority:** Quarterly meetings with no decision authority add overhead without influence. Monthly meetings with binding authority on specific functions create genuine governance with modest time investment.

**Stakeholder fatigue:** When the same individuals serve on multiple advisory bodies, attend numerous listening sessions, and receive repeated requests for input, coordination burden falls on limited community capacity. The willing get overworked; the broader community remains unengaged.

## Recommendations

### For State Agencies

**Clarify what coordination structures can decide.** Advisory bodies with clear, bounded authority function better than bodies with vague advisory mandates. Specify which decisions the body influences, which it approves, and which occur outside its scope.

**Meet where communities live.** Rotating meeting locations to rural communities rather than convening always at the state capital signals whose voice the structure serves. The inconvenience to agency staff is minor; the message to communities is substantial.

**Invest in relationship before structure.** Advisory committees function better when members know each other and trust agency staff. Relationship-building before formal structure enables the dynamics that make structure effective.

**Give communities actual authority over something.** Even limited authority transforms advisory participation into governance. Authority to allocate a portion of funding, select among finalist subawardees, or prioritize among implementation options creates stakes that advisory observation lacks.

**Report back on how input changed decisions.** Closing the loop between stakeholder input and agency action demonstrates influence and builds trust. When input did not change decisions, explain why. Accountability for explaining non-adoption improves on silence.

### For CMS

**Require evidence of influence, not just participation.** Current documentation requirements show process: meetings held, comments received, stakeholders listed. Requiring states to document how stakeholder input changed plans would reveal influence rather than merely process.

**Assess power distribution, not meeting frequency.** States that meet frequently with advisory bodies that cannot decide anything demonstrate less coordination than states that meet less frequently with bodies that hold actual authority.

**Fund coordination capacity building.** States with limited capacity satisfy requirements through minimal compliance. Technical assistance for meaningful stakeholder engagement would improve implementation beyond what requirements alone achieve.

**Accept that community governance takes time.** Transformation timelines may not accommodate the relationship-building that genuine community authority requires. Acknowledging this tension and adjusting expectations could encourage states to invest in governance rather than documentation.

### For Evaluators and Observers

**Look beyond meeting attendance.** Whether stakeholders attend meetings matters less than whether their attendance influences decisions. Evaluation should assess influence, not participation.

**Interview stakeholders directly.** Agency documentation shows agency perspective. Stakeholder perspective on whether coordination is meaningful requires asking stakeholders.

**Track decision changes.** Compare initial proposals to final decisions across multiple decision points. Consistent changes in response to stakeholder input suggest genuine coordination; consistent unchanged decisions suggest theater.

**Assess who controls agendas.** Agenda control shapes what coordination addresses. Stakeholder-driven agendas suggest different power dynamics than agency-controlled agendas, regardless of meeting format.

## Conclusion

Stakeholder coordination in RHTP implementation predominantly creates appearance of distributed input while concentrating actual authority at state agencies. Advisory committees meet; they do not govern. Communities participate; they do not decide. The structures satisfy federal documentation requirements without distributing power.

This finding describes pattern rather than mandate. Some states have created coordination structures where stakeholders genuinely influence decisions, where communities hold actual authority, where the process of coordination changes outcomes. These exceptions demonstrate that alternatives are possible while remaining exceptional.

The tension between centralized efficiency and local knowledge cannot be resolved through better coordination structures alone. Resolution requires clarity about which decisions benefit from which approach, and willingness to accept the costs of each. Centralization is fast but disconnected; distribution is adaptive but fragmented. Effective coordination navigates between them rather than pretending the tension does not exist.

Series 5 continues by examining how state agencies procure and contract for implementation (5C), where the tension between process compliance and outcome achievement creates different coordination challenges with similarly unresolved tensions.
