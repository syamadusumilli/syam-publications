The Rural Health Transformation Program requires every state to designate a single lead agency accountable for implementing federal investments ranging from $50 million to $2 billion over five years. Governors sign designations, CMS executes cooperative agreements, and organizational charts display clean lines of authority flowing from federal oversight through state agencies to rural communities. This formal accountability structure assumes that the entity named on paper controls the resources and decisions necessary to perform its designated functions. That assumption fails with sufficient frequency to reshape RHTP implementation in ways federal program design cannot acknowledge.

The gap between formal accountability and actual authority matters because CMS holds lead agencies responsible for outcomes they sometimes cannot control while actual decision-makers face no federal oversight. A Department of Health designated as lead agency may propose subaward allocations that require Governor's office approval, depend on Medicaid payment policy decisions made by a separate agency, and face procurement timelines controlled by central administrative services beyond the lead agency's authority to accelerate. The DOH bears accountability for implementation delays caused by approval processes it cannot compel, payment policies it cannot set, and procurement requirements it cannot override. Organizational charts show the DOH in charge. Reality distributes authority across agencies, offices, and authorities that federal oversight cannot see.

This distribution is not a defect requiring correction but rather the inherent structure of cooperative federalism, where federal funds flow through state bureaucracies shaped by political incentives, historical organizational choices, and leadership personalities that no Notice of Funding Opportunity can standardize. **State government has always operated through relationships, politics, and informal authority that formal structures obscure.** CMS designed RHTP accountability for an organizational clarity that state government rarely provides, creating a federal oversight apparatus that monitors organizational charts while actual implementation proceeds through channels those charts do not capture.

Lead agency designation patterns cluster into distinct configurations with predictable authority implications. Twenty-four states designated **State Departments of Health** as lead agencies, reflecting DOH traditional responsibility for population health programs and existing relationships with rural providers through Flex Program administration. This designation works when DOH controls sufficient resources and decision authority. It fails when Medicaid agencies control the payment systems determining provider viability, when Governor's offices override strategic decisions, or when DOH lacks implementation capacity that more operational agencies possess. The DOH gap pattern emerges in states where health policy authority has migrated to Medicaid over decades while formal DOH responsibility remained. Medicaid expansion, managed care transitions, and payment reform initiatives accumulated at Medicaid agencies while DOH retained population health programs with smaller budgets and less policy impact.

Fourteen states placed Medicaid agencies in the lead position, producing **smaller authority gaps between accountability and control**. Arizona's AHCCCS, Rhode Island's EOHHS, Connecticut's DSS, and Missouri's DSS lead RHTP in states where the agencies responsible hold cooperative agreements. The alignment logic is straightforward: Medicaid agencies control payment systems that determine whether rural healthcare remains viable, manage eligibility systems that determine coverage, and negotiate with managed care organizations that increasingly dominate rural markets. Placing RHTP authority at Medicaid agencies keeps transformation decisions near the levers that matter most. These states also face the simultaneous pressure of H.R. 1 Medicaid cuts, with the agency managing RHTP investment simultaneously managing coverage retrenchment. Whether this proximity enables coordination or creates conflicting priorities depends on leadership and political context that varies across jurisdictions.

Seven states employ combined agency structures integrating health, Medicaid, and social services under unified leadership. Michigan's Department of Health and Human Services exemplifies this approach, eliminating cross-agency coordination problems that fragment implementation elsewhere. Combined structures reduce authority gaps by placing related functions under common leadership, enabling RHTP decisions about workforce development, payment reform, and service delivery to align when one agency controls all three domains. The weakness is scope: an agency responsible for everything may prioritize nothing. MDHHS manages Medicaid, child welfare, mental health, aging services, public health, and now RHTP, with rural health transformation competing for leadership attention against crises in child protective services, opioid overdose mortality, and Medicaid managed care procurement.

Three states designated **State Offices of Rural Health as lead agencies or co-leads**, placing RHTP authority with entities possessing deepest rural health expertise but experiencing severe and predictable authority gaps. SORHs typically operate with small staffs, limited budgets, and advisory rather than operational authority. They coordinate, convene, and consult but rarely control resources or direct implementation. A SORH designated as lead agency cannot execute RHTP's scope without borrowing authority from elsewhere, contributing expertise to decisions made by others while bearing accountability for outcomes it cannot control. This pattern persists because Governors recognize SORH expertise without examining SORH authority, honoring rural health knowledge while ignoring the gap between knowledge and power.

The authority gap manifests through multiple mechanisms that federal oversight cannot directly observe. **Governor's office intervention** occurs when Governors nominally delegate program authority while reserving substantive decisions, with large subawards, controversial allocations, and politically visible programs requiring Governor approval regardless of formal delegation. Medicaid control of resources means that even when Departments of Health hold RHTP cooperative agreements, Medicaid agencies control payment systems determining whether transformation investments produce sustainable results. A workforce development initiative means nothing if Medicaid reimbursement cannot support newly trained providers. Legislative appropriations constrain lead agency discretion through budget riders and explicit direction on RHTP priorities. Central administrative services agencies control procurement processes regardless of which agency holds program authority, with lead agencies facing timelines and requirements imposed by agencies with no RHTP accountability. Civil service constraints mean lead agency leadership may lack authority to hire, fire, or reassign staff needed for implementation.

CMS cannot directly observe these authority gaps through organizational charts, cooperative agreements, or formal attestations. Evaluation requires indicators beyond formal documentation: decision timeline analysis comparing time from CMS guidance to state implementation decision, revision patterns tracking how proposals change between lead agency submission and final approval, spokesperson identification noting who represents RHTP decisions publicly, and stakeholder assessment asking providers who they contact when seeking decisions. Experienced stakeholders learn actual decision-making patterns regardless of formal structure, identifying where authority actually rests by observing who controls outcomes rather than who holds titles.

Two states illustrate how similar formal structures produce divergent authority realities. Oklahoma's State Department of Health serves as lead agency with genuine authority over direct RHTP expenditures, but the Oklahoma Health Care Authority controls payment systems essential for transformation sustainability. OHCA's SoonerSelect managed care transition proceeded independently of OSDH RHTP planning. OSDH makes RHTP decisions within the constraint that those decisions must eventually work within OHCA payment reality it does not control. Oklahoma's authority gap manifests as coordination requirement rather than decision override, a **moderate gap** where the lead agency has real authority over direct expenditures but limited influence over the Medicaid context determining whether those expenditures produce sustainable results.

Arizona's AHCCCS serves as both Medicaid agency and RHTP lead, eliminating the coordination gap Oklahoma faces. When AHCCCS makes transformation decisions, the same agency controls payment policy, producing structural integration rather than negotiated coordination. Yet AHCCCS operates under Arizona's unusual Medicaid politics, with trigger law threatening automatic Medicaid expansion repeal if federal matching drops below 80 percent and Governor Katie Hobbs directing health policy while constrained by Republican legislative majorities. AHCCCS transformation decisions must navigate political context that could fundamentally alter the Medicaid landscape on which RHTP builds. Arizona's authority gap is low regarding cross-agency coordination but high regarding political constraint.

The capacity skepticism perspective argues that authority gaps matter less than capacity gaps, with many lead agencies unable to perform required functions regardless of formal or actual authority. GAO findings consistently document state agency capacity limitations, with the 2025 High-Risk List identifying 20 of 37 items stemming from agencies lacking appropriate workforce skills or sufficient employee numbers. A CDC-funded study estimated 239,000 state and local public health workers in 2022, with documented shortages in nursing, epidemiology, and program management. Categorical funding restrictions prevent agencies from hiring staff for RHTP even when positions are needed. However, capacity is not deterministically limiting. Maine's public health workforce improvements demonstrated that targeted investment and leadership focus can overcome baseline capacity constraints, with leadership and political commitment appearing to matter at least as much as existing capacity. **Capacity constraints and authority gaps interact**: an agency with limited capacity but genuine authority can seek help to build capability, while an agency with strong capacity but limited authority cannot implement what it knows how to do.

Authority gaps create specific problems for RHTP implementation that federal program design cannot easily address. Sustainability planning requires states to plan for post-2030 sustainability, but lead agencies without authority over Medicaid payment policy cannot credibly commit to sustainable financing. Their sustainability plans describe aspirations rather than commitments because the commitments require decisions they cannot make. Integration initiatives requiring Medicaid alignment, behavioral health integration, or social services coordination depend on authorities beyond most lead agencies' control. Performance accountability means CMS holds lead agencies accountable for outcomes that may depend on decisions made elsewhere, with agencies penalized for slow implementation potentially having waited for procurement approval from agencies CMS
