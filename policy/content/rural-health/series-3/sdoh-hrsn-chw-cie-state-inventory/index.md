*Rural Health Transformation Project*
*Version 13: January 2026*

## Purpose

This technical document provides **cross-cutting inventory of social care integration** across all 50 states under the Rural Health Transformation Program. The document serves three functions:

1. **Inventory what states proposed** for SDOH screening, HRSN navigation, CHW deployment, and CIE platforms
2. **Assess what survived** partial funding decisions and implementation prioritization
3. **Track implementation status** across key social care infrastructure categories

Social care components rank among the **most vulnerable RHTP elements**. Rural hospital CEOs consistently rank social determinants work around 15th on priority lists, behind workforce, technology, and operational concerns. This document tracks which states protected social care investment and which allowed these components to erode under budget pressure.

**Related Documents:**
- **3-TD-E-Regional:** Detailed state-by-state analysis organized by region
- **GGH_CIE_Market_Assessment:** Vendor landscape and market opportunity analysis

## Analytical Framework

**Key Definitions**

**SDOH (Social Determinants of Health):** The conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live, and age that shape health outcomes. Includes economic stability, education, social and community context, health care access, and neighborhood/built environment.

**HRSN (Health-Related Social Needs):** The individual-level social needs affecting a patient's health, such as food insecurity, housing instability, transportation barriers, and utility difficulties. HRSN work involves screening for these needs and connecting patients to resources.

**CHW (Community Health Worker):** A frontline public health worker who is a trusted member of the community served. CHWs serve as liaisons between health services and the community, providing culturally appropriate health education, informal counseling, social support, and advocacy.

**CIE (Community Information Exchange):** A network of multidisciplinary organizations that use a shared technology platform to collaborate on social care referrals. CIE enables closed-loop referrals where the outcome of a referral is tracked and reported back to the referring organization.

**Assessment Categories**

| Category | Definition |
|----------|------------|
| **Funded** | Social care components clearly preserved with dedicated budget lines |
| **Partial** | Some components funded, others reduced or deprioritized |
| **At Risk** | Included in application but vulnerable to implementation cuts |
| **Cut** | Explicitly removed or defunded post-award |
| **Embedded** | Social care included within other initiatives without dedicated funding |
| **Unknown** | Insufficient public documentation to assess |

## Section 3: CIE Platform Inventory

### Statewide Platform Status

| Status | States |
|--------|--------|
| **Statewide single vendor** | PA (Findhelp), TN (Findhelp), NM (Findhelp), CT (Unite Us), RI (Unite Us), MN (Unite Us), AZ (Unite Us), NC (Unite Us), MT (NobleSG), OR (state-built), NE (Unite Us), ND (Unite Us), SD (Unite Us), FL (Unite Us) |
| **Statewide dual vendor** | NY (Unite Us + Findhelp) |
| **Regional deployments** | CA (MCP-integrated), **TX (Findhelp/Unite Us fragmented)**, OH, MA, NJ, WA, CO, IL, IN, MO, DE, KS, LA, SC |
| **Procurement pending** | WA, VT |
| **Developing (distributed)** | MI |
| **Fragmented** | TX, OH, KY |
| **None/major gap** | GA, MS, NH, HI, AK, NV, AL, AR, WV (findhelp at WVU only), **OK (Unite Oklahoma limited)** |

### South Central/Western Priority Region CIE Status (Updated January 29, 2026)

| State | Platform | Vendor | Coverage | RHTP Funded | Notes |
|-------|----------|--------|----------|-------------|-------|
| **Texas** | **Fragmented Regional** | Findhelp (11 systems, 8 FQHCs, Superior MCO) + Unite Us (Lubbock) | Regional pockets | No | **No statewide coordination; largest rural pop nationally** |
| **Oklahoma** | **Limited** | Unite Oklahoma | Unknown/limited scale | Unknown | **Near-greenfield; 2024 SPA creates CHW opportunity** |
| **California** | CalAIM/MCP-integrated | MCP-specific tools | Statewide (MCP-mandated) | N/A (CalAIM) | **Platform market closed; CalAIM supersedes CIE model** |

**Regional Context:** South Central/Western states present **dramatically different paradigms**. Texas demonstrates **fragmented CIE landscape** with Findhelp and Unite Us regional deployments but no statewide coordination despite having nation's largest rural population (4.96M). Oklahoma shows **near-greenfield opportunity** with minimal Unite Oklahoma presence and 2024 SPA approval creating CHW services pathway. California operates in **fundamentally different paradigm** where CalAIM MCP integration closes traditional CIE market.

### Deep South Priority Region CIE Status (Updated January 29, 2026)

| State | Platform | Vendor | Coverage | RHTP Funded | Notes |
|-------|----------|--------|----------|-------------|-------|
| **Mississippi** | **None** | N/A | 0% | No | **No CIE infrastructure identified** |
| **Tennessee** | Statewide | Findhelp (TN Community Compass) | Statewide (MCO-driven) | No (predates) | Since 2015; MCO partnerships established |
| **Georgia** | **None** | N/A | 0% | **Explicitly excluded** | Social care absent from RHTP application |
| **North Carolina** | Statewide | Unite Us (NCCARE360) | All 100 counties | Provider connectivity | HOP discontinuation threatens services |

**Regional Context:** Deep South states show **binary CIE market structure**. Tennessee and North Carolina have mature statewide platforms with MCO integration creating significant market barriers. Mississippi and Georgia have **zero CIE infrastructure**, representing the highest GGH opportunity in the region. Non-expansion status correlates with social care deprioritization.

### Appalachian Priority Region CIE Status (Updated January 29, 2026)

| State | Platform | Vendor | Coverage | RHTP Funded | Notes |
|-------|----------|--------|----------|-------------|-------|
| **Ohio** | Pathways HUBs (regional) | 12 certified hubs | 70+ counties (fragmented) | No | **No statewide platform**, regional hubs only |
| **Kentucky** | **None statewide** | N/A | 0% | No | No statewide CIE; KHIE transitioning to CRISP |
| **West Virginia** | findhelp (single system) | WVU Medicine only | Single system | No | Near-greenfield opportunity |

**Regional Context:** Appalachian states share **robust CHW infrastructure without statewide CIE platforms**. Ohio's Pathways HUB model operates through 12 regional hubs but lacks interoperability. Kentucky's 30-year Homeplace program demonstrates CHW effectiveness without platform coordination. West Virginia's CHERP training pipeline produces CHWs without platform enablement.

### Southeast Region CIE Status (Updated January 29, 2026)

| State | Platform | Vendor | Coverage | RHTP Funded | Notes |
|-------|----------|--------|----------|-------------|-------|
| **Alabama** | None | N/A | 0% | No | **No CIE infrastructure identified** |
| **Arkansas** | None statewide | N/A | 0% | No | 211 only, no closed-loop referrals |
| **Florida** | Unite Florida | Unite Us | Statewide (MCO-driven) | No (predates) | Community Care Plan partnership March 2025 |
| **Louisiana** | Unite Louisiana | Unite Us | Partial (14+ parishes) | Under consideration | MCO partnerships established |
| **South Carolina** | Unite South Carolina | Unite Us | Regional (28 counties) | No | United Way partnership October 2022 |

### Plains Region CIE Status (Updated January 29, 2026)

| State | Platform | Vendor | Coverage | RHTP Funded | Notes |
|-------|----------|--------|----------|-------------|-------|
| **Kansas** | Regional | Findhelp | KC metro area | No | 22+ Findhelp customers statewide |
| **Nebraska** | Unite Nebraska | Unite Us | Statewide | No (predates) | NeHII partnership June 2020 |
| **North Dakota** | Unite ND | Unite Us | Statewide | No (predates) | NeHII expansion October 2020 |
| **South Dakota** | Unite SD | Unite Us | Statewide | No (predates) | NeHII expansion October 2020 |

## Section 4: Regional Summary Tables

### South Central/Western Priority Region Summary (Batch 9 Complete Research)

| State | CIE Status | CHW Status | SDOH/HRSN | TD-E | GGH CIE Gap |
|-------|------------|------------|-----------|------|-------------|
| **TX** | Fragmented Regional (Findhelp/Unite Us) | **Mandatory cert (DSHS, 49 programs), limited Medicaid (HB 113/1575)** | MCO-fragmented | **Partial** | **MODERATE-HIGH** |
| **OK** | Limited (Unite Oklahoma) | **No cert, 2024 SPA approved (C3 framework)** | Emerging MCO | **Emerging** | **MODERATE** |
| **CA** | CalAIM/MCP-integrated | **Paused cert (HCAI), Medi-Cal benefit active ($31.74/30min)** | Funded (CalAIM) | **Funded** | **LOW** |

**Key South Central/Western Findings:**

1. **Texas** presents **highest GGH opportunity** in Batch 9: no statewide CIE despite Findhelp/Unite Us regional presence, **mature mandatory CHW certification (2001)** with 49 training programs but **limited Medicaid reimbursement** (HB 113/HB 1575 specific populations only), largest rural population nationally (4.96M)

2. **Oklahoma** represents **emerging opportunity**: 2024 SPA approval for CHW Medicaid reimbursement without certification requirement creates services pathway, minimal CIE infrastructure (Unite Oklahoma limited scale), managed care transition creating implementation uncertainty

3. **California** presents **lowest opportunity** in Batch 9: CalAIM MCP integration effectively closes platform market, CHW certification paused (Nov 2023) despite active Medi-Cal benefit constrains workforce growth, PATH funding ($1.84B) already targeting rural areas

4. **Regional pattern:** Non-expansion status (TX, OK) correlates with MCO-fragmented SDOH approaches. Expansion status (CA) enables comprehensive transformation but saturates market.

### Deep South Priority Region Summary (Batch 7 Complete Research)

| State | CIE Status | CHW Status | SDOH/HRSN | TD-E | GGH CIE Gap |
|-------|------------|------------|-----------|------|-------------|
| **MS** | **None** | **Emerging (HB 1401, 2025)** | At Risk | **Partial** | **CRITICAL** |
| **TN** | Statewide (Findhelp) | Voluntary (TNCHWA) | At Risk | **Moderate** | **LOW** |
| **GA** | **None** | Pending (HB 291) | **Cut** | **Cut** | **CRITICAL** |
| **NC** | Statewide (Unite Us/NCCARE360) | MCO-integrated | At Risk (HOP ending) | **At Risk** | **LOW** |

**Key Deep South Findings:**

1. **Mississippi** represents **highest GGH opportunity** in Deep South: no CIE platform, **emerging CHW Medicaid pathway (HB 1401, 2025)** creates certification and directs SPA development, Delta Region strategic alignment

2. **Georgia** represents **critical CIE opportunity**: no CIE platform, **social care explicitly excluded** from RHTP application despite having region's worst coverage gap (175,000+ in partial Pathways expansion, only ~6,500 enrolled)

3. **Tennessee** has **mature statewide CIE** (TN Community Compass/Findhelp since 2015) but **no CHW Medicaid reimbursement**, creating low platform opportunity but CHW services gap

4. **North Carolina** has **nation-leading CIE deployment** (NCCARE360/Unite Us in all 100 counties) with **MCO-integrated CHW model** but faces **HOP discontinuation** threatening service delivery funding

### Appalachian Priority Region Summary (Batch 8 Complete Research)

| State | CIE Status | CHW Status | SDOH/HRSN | TD-E | GGH CIE Gap |
|-------|------------|------------|-----------|------|-------------|
| **OH** | Pathways HUBs (regional, 70+ counties) | Cert (OBN, 2003), MCO maternal only | Partial | **Partial** | **MODERATE** |
| **KY** | **None statewide** | Cert (OCHW), MCO contracts | 1115 HRSN approved (TEAMKY) | **Funded** | **MODERATE** |
| **WV** | findhelp (WVU only) | Training (CHERP), MCO maternal/SUD | Limited | **Partial** | **MODERATE-HIGH** |

**Key Appalachian Findings:**

1. **West Virginia** represents **highest Appalachian GGH opportunity**: near-greenfield CIE (findhelp at WVU only), **highest per-capita RHTP funding nationally ($574/rural resident)**, CHERP training pipeline produces CHWs without platform enablement

2. **Ohio** demonstrates **nation's most developed Pathways HUB network** (12 certified hubs, 70+ counties) but **no interoperability between hubs** and no statewide CIE, creating federated platform opportunity

3. **Kentucky** has **1115 HRSN waiver approved** (TEAMKY) with recuperative care pilot and recovery residence support but **no statewide CIE**, creating immediate coordination needs

4. **Regional pattern:** All three states have **robust CHW infrastructure without sustainable financing**. MCO-mediated reimbursement limited to maternal/SUD populations excludes chronic disease management and community-based organizations.
