Ohio receives $202 million in fiscal year 2026 under the Rural Health Transformation Program, precisely the national average for a state with 4.4 million rural residents across 73 non-urban counties. This translates to $46 per rural resident annually, less than the cost of a single primary care visit. Against this funding reality, Ohio confronts 33 Critical Access Hospitals operating on margins of 2% or less, 13 maternity care deserts, primary care availability at half urban levels, and 32 Appalachian counties where life expectancy runs ten years shorter than statewide averages. The question Part 2 examines: what does Ohio propose to do with that funding?

The answer reveals a state betting on incremental improvement over structural transformation. Five initiatives organize the approach: Rural Patient Health Innovation Hubs establishing regional coordination, Emergency Care Transformation scaling treat-in-place protocols, School-Based Health Centers bringing care to where children already congregate, the OH SEE Program expanding mobile vision and hearing services, and the Rural Workforce Pipeline building a continuum from high school through professional employment. Cross-cutting strategies embed telehealth, remote monitoring, and interoperable electronic health records across all initiatives. The Ohio Department of Health serves as lead agency and prime awardee, coordinating implementation across multiple offices with distinct responsibilities. The strategy emphasizes proven models over untested innovations, existing infrastructure over new construction, and visible wins over ambitious experiments.

This is not a plan designed to fail. It is also not a plan designed to transform. Ohio's bet is simpler: that making what already exists work better is more achievable than reimagining rural healthcare from scratch. Whether that bet proves sufficient depends on implementation details that remain unclear and political will that remains untested.

The governance structure divides responsibility across multiple offices within the Ohio Department of Health. The Primary Care Office administers workforce development programs including loan repayment, J-1 visa waivers, and National Health Service Corps coordination, taking lead responsibility for the Rural Workforce Pipeline initiative. The Bureau of Maternal, Child and Family Health manages school-based health center expansion, leveraging existing relationships with school districts and pediatric care networks while leading the OH SEE vision program scaling. The State Office of Rural Health coordinates rural health initiatives statewide, serving as natural convener for Rural Patient Health Innovation Hub development. Ohio Emergency Medical Services oversees the Emergency Care Transformation initiative, building on existing regulatory authority over EMS certification, training, and protocol development. This division of labor could facilitate implementation, with each office handling initiatives within their expertise, or it could create coordination challenges, with multiple offices competing for limited budget and unclear accountability for cross-cutting goals.

Ohio's application articulates a theory of change rooted in **systems integration rather than systems replacement**. The premise: rural healthcare fails not because individual components are broken but because they operate in isolation. Hospitals, federally qualified health centers, emergency medical services, pharmacies, behavioral health agencies, and community organizations each deliver services without coordination. Patients fall through cracks during transitions, high-need patients navigate multiple disconnected providers, and care gets duplicated or neglected. The transformation strategy therefore emphasizes connection over construction. Rather than building new facilities, Ohio links existing ones. Rather than creating new service lines, Ohio coordinates existing capacity. Rather than recruiting thousands of new providers, Ohio retains the ones already practicing and connects them to support networks. This approach has the virtue of achievability within five years and $202 million. It also has the limitation of accepting existing capacity as sufficient when evidence suggests otherwise.

The five initiatives theoretically form an interconnected system. The Rural Workforce Pipeline ensures providers to staff school-based health centers and innovation hubs while medical students train in school-based centers and hub care teams, creating rural practice exposure that increases retention probability. School-Based Health Centers bring care to rural children while serving as training sites for workforce development, with complex cases escalating to innovation hubs for coordinated specialty care. Rural Patient Health Innovation Hubs anchor regional coordination, connecting hospitals, federally qualified health centers, emergency medical services, and community partners while recruiting workforce through pipeline programs and providing backup support to school-based centers. Emergency Care Transformation integrates with hub networks, allowing emergency medical services to triage patients to appropriate care settings rather than defaulting to distant emergency departments. The OH SEE Program delivers mobile services that complement fixed school-based health centers, reaching students in districts without center capacity. Cross-cutting technology strategies enable these connections through telehealth, shared electronic records, and remote monitoring. Whether these interconnections function as designed depends on coordination mechanisms that remain underdeveloped and stakeholder willingness to collaborate rather than compete.

The Rural Patient Health Innovation Hubs represent Ohio's most ambitious initiative, attempting to solve healthcare fragmentation through regional coordination structures. An estimated 25 to 30 percent of RHTP funding, between $50 million and $60 million over five years, supports establishing five to seven geographic hubs across Ohio's rural regions. Each hub anchors around a Critical Access Hospital or large federally qualified health center with strong operational capacity, adequate electronic health record infrastructure, and willingness to serve a coordinating role. Spoke sites connect to the hub, including smaller Critical Access Hospitals, Rural Health Clinics, federally qualified health center satellite sites, and potentially private primary care practices willing to participate. Regional hub structure divides rural Ohio into five to seven geographic regions, with selection criteria for hub anchors likely including existing infrastructure capacity, geographic centrality within region, electronic health record capabilities, and relationships with regional providers. Each hub coordinates care for a defined population of 100,000 to 300,000 people depending on regional geography and density.

The hub does not deliver all care. It coordinates care delivered across the network, manages care transitions, tracks high-need patients, and facilitates specialty access through telehealth connections to academic medical centers. Hub development prioritizes Appalachian Ohio's 32 counties where health disparities concentrate most severely. The southeastern quadrant of the state, stretching from the northeastern corner to the southern border, encompasses communities with the highest poverty rates, worst health outcomes, and most severe provider shortages. Secondary priority extends to northwestern agricultural counties where aging farm populations face access challenges and exurban growth counties around Columbus where population expansion strains infrastructure designed for smaller populations. Geographic diversity creates implementation complexity. What works in densely populated Athens County may fail in sparsely populated Meigs County. Hub models must accommodate variation or produce uneven results.

Hub development follows a phased approach. Years 2026 through 2027 focus on identifying and contracting with two to three pilot hub anchors, establishing governance structures, deploying initial technology infrastructure, and recruiting care coordination staff. Years 2027 through 2028 expand to the full five to seven hub network, integrate spoke sites, launch care coordination services, and establish telehealth connections. Years 2028 through 2030 scale population health management, integrate behavioral health and social services, demonstrate outcomes, and plan for sustainability. The two-year spending requirement demands aggressive timeline execution, with fiscal year 2026 funds obligated by September 30, 2027. This creates pressure to select partners and launch activities before comprehensive planning completes.

Ohio's Emergency Care Transformation initiative scales a successful pilot enabling emergency medical services to provide treat-in-place or alternate-destination care, reducing unnecessary emergency department use through advanced training, system upgrades, and improved connectivity. The initiative builds on existing community paramedicine protocols that allow trained paramedics to assess patients in the field and determine appropriate care pathways. Rather than transporting all patients to distant emergency departments by default, trained emergency medical services teams can treat minor conditions on scene, transport to urgent care facilities, or connect patients with telehealth consultations. Target investment of $25 million to $35 million over five years supports protocol development, emergency medical services training expansion, dispatch system upgrades enabling destination selection, and connectivity infrastructure linking field units to receiving facilities.

Rural Ohioans face average transport times exceeding 30 minutes to emergency departments in many counties. For time-sensitive conditions, this delay proves fatal. For non-emergent conditions, it consumes resources and creates unnecessary emergency department crowding. Emergency Care Transformation targets both scenarios. Time-sensitive cases benefit from improved protocol coordination and destination optimization. Non-emergent cases receive appropriate care without resource-intensive emergency department visits. Geographic prioritization focuses on counties with the longest transport times, highest rates of unnecessary emergency department utilization, and emergency medical services agencies with capacity for advanced training.

Success depends on factors partially outside RHTP control. Medical direction must approve expanded protocols, with physician oversight requirements varying by county medical director philosophy. Hospital cooperation enables alternate destinations, as facilities must accept patients from emergency medical services diversion and integrate them into appropriate care pathways. Reimbursement structures must support treat-in-place activities, yet current payment models reimburse transport but not on-scene treatment, creating financial disincentives for the behavior RHTP encourages. Workforce availability constrains expansion, as emergency medical services agencies already face staffing shortages and advanced training requirements further strain limited personnel.

School-based health centers represent Ohio's most visible initiative, targeting rural school districts without existing centers. An estimated 25 to 30 percent of
