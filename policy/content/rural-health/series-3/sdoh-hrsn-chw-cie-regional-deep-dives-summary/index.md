The Rural Health Transformation Program operates against a landscape where social determinants of health infrastructure exists in fragmented, regionally bounded pockets rather than coordinated national systems. This technical analysis examines social care coordination infrastructure across states receiving RHTP funding, revealing market opportunities that correlate strongly with Medicaid expansion status and state capacity. The core finding: **non-expansion states systematically deprioritize social care integration**, creating greenfield platform markets in regions with the highest rural health vulnerability.

The South Central and Western region demonstrates this pattern most starkly. Texas maintains the nation's largest rural population at 4.96 million residents yet operates without statewide closed-loop infrastructure for social needs referrals. The state's 20-year history of mandatory community health worker certification coexists with severely limited Medicaid reimbursement pathways, creating a paradox where workforce infrastructure exists without sustainable financing. Findhelp has deployed across 11 hospital systems and 8 federally qualified health centers, while Unite Us maintains presence through partnerships like UMC Lubbock's collaboration with South Plains Food Bank, but no vendor has achieved coordination across regions. The state's $515.9 million RHTP award translates to approximately $104 per rural resident, reflecting formula penalties for population scale rather than geographic sparsity. **Multiple platforms serve overlapping geographies without data exchange protocols**, a fragmentation the Center for Health Care Strategies documented in May 2025 as requiring urgent interoperability standards.

Texas presents moderate-high platform opportunity precisely because its mature workforce infrastructure lacks coordinating technology. The state's 49 approved community health worker training programs produce certified workers under Health and Safety Code Chapter 48, effective since 2001, but recent legislation creates only narrow reimbursement pathways. HB 113 from 2023 allows managed care organizations to categorize community health worker expenditures as quality improvement costs rather than covered services. HB 1575 establishes community health workers as separate provider types but restricts coverage to Case Management for Children and Pregnant Women programs only. No comprehensive State Plan Amendment exists for general population services, leaving most community health worker activity dependent on managed care organization value-added benefits rather than fee-for-service pathways. This infrastructure without financing creates **implementation opportunity rather than displacement risk**, particularly in East Texas regions where hospital systems face elevated financial vulnerability.

Oklahoma demonstrates the opposite trajectory: minimal existing infrastructure but accelerating policy development. The state's $195.4 million RHTP allocation serves approximately 525,000 rural residents at $372 per capita, substantially higher than Texas due to smaller population denominator. Unite Oklahoma exists as a network presence but lacks documented scale or utilization metrics comparable to mature deployments in other states. The absence of statewide closed-loop referral capability creates near-greenfield market conditions. However, Oklahoma achieved significant policy advancement in 2024 when CMS approved a State Plan Amendment for community health worker services, joining Colorado, Georgia, and Washington as states receiving approval that year. The National Academy for State Health Policy confirms this development, with reimbursement requirements specifying C3 training certificate or 2,000 hours documented experience. Services must be delivered at public health clinics under physician or licensed practitioner orders. The state chose not to implement certification requirements, creating lower barriers to workforce entry than certification-mandatory states while establishing Medicaid financing infrastructure. Oklahoma Complete Health already operates community health worker home visits for pediatric asthma management as managed care value-added services, demonstrating managed care organization interest predating the State Plan Amendment approval.

The state's 39 federally recognized tribes complicate implementation strategy. Community Health Representatives operate through Indian Health Service and tribal health programs with distinct training, supervision, and service delivery models not integrated with state Medicaid frameworks. Any platform deployment strategy requires **parallel tribal engagement approaches** rather than assuming state infrastructure encompasses tribal health systems. Oklahoma's managed care transition, ongoing during RHTP implementation, creates competing organizational priorities that may delay social care integration focus despite new financing mechanisms.

California operates in a fundamentally different paradigm where traditional closed-loop referral platforms become obsolete. CalAIM, the state's comprehensive Medicaid transformation through its 1115 demonstration waiver, mandates 14 Community Supports services delivered through managed care plan contracts rather than standalone referral platforms. Housing transition navigation, medical respite, medically supportive food services, environmental accessibility adaptations, and other services operate as managed care plan benefits rather than externally coordinated resources. Enhanced Care Management provides intensive coordination for high-need populations experiencing homelessness, high utilization patterns, serious mental illness, or pregnancy and postpartum status. The state's Data Exchange Framework, effective January 2024, mandates health and social service data exchange across organizations, creating state-level coordination infrastructure superseding vendor platforms. The California Health Care Foundation's 2024 survey documented lower utilization than projected, with Enhanced Care Management enrolling 0.9 percent of eligible populations and Community Supports achieving similar penetration. Managed care plans vary substantially in eligibility criteria and implementation approaches, with administrative burden cited as significant barrier. **The $1.84 billion Provider Assistance for Transition to Health funding targets rural and historically under-resourced areas**, acknowledging implementation gaps in regions outside major metropolitan concentrations.

California's community health worker landscape reveals similar paradoxes to Texas but with opposite cause. The state established Medi-Cal community health worker benefit effective July 2022 with CPT codes 98960 through 98962 and Medicare G-codes for reimbursement. The 2025 rate increased to $31.74 per 30 minutes, calculated at 100 percent of Medicare relative value units. Services require written recommendation from licensed providers and plan of care documentation for services exceeding six hours. Community-based organizations and local health jurisdictions gained supervising provider authority in January 2024, expanding beyond traditional clinical supervision models. However, the Health Care Access and Information office paused certification guidance in November 2023 following stakeholder feedback that proposed requirements had not received adequate engagement and were not fit for purpose. The CalHHS, HCAI, and DHCS conducted second engagement rounds in 2024 with 680 community health workers participating across 23 sessions hosted by 20 organizations. An Advisory Workgroup with majority active community health worker membership formed in December 2024, but certification development remains indefinitely paused. The 2024 Budget Act simultaneously eliminated most HCAI community health worker funding, constraining workforce development investment precisely when benefit structure theoretically supports expansion. **Reimbursement rates at $31.74 per 30 minutes prove insufficient for community-based organization sustainability** when administrative burden exceeds reimbursement value for many providers.

California presents low platform opportunity given CalAIM and managed care plan saturation. Limited service delivery opportunities exist in rural regions where Community Supports uptake remains low and community-based organization capacity insufficient, but these require managed care plan partnerships rather than standalone platform deployment. The regulatory complexity and CalAIM infrastructure superseding traditional approaches make statewide entry inadvisable.

The Deep South region divides cleanly between states with mature platform deployments and states with complete absence of infrastructure. North Carolina operates NCCARE360, the nation's most comprehensive statewide closed-loop infrastructure covering all 100 counties through Unite Us platform. The deployment began with 2019 pilots and achieved statewide expansion with deep Medicaid Prepaid Health Plan integration. However, Healthy Opportunities Pilots, which provided service delivery funding for social care interventions addressing housing, food, transportation, and interpersonal safety, face discontinuation. **Platform maturity without service delivery funding creates sustainability risk** despite technology infrastructure remaining operational. The state's community health worker programs operate through Prepaid Health Plan contracts with managed care organization-based reimbursement rather than direct State Plan Amendment coverage. North Carolina's $436.5 million RHTP allocation serves approximately 2.5 million rural residents at $175 per capita. The combination of platform saturation and Medicaid expansion status creates low market opportunity, with service delivery gaps from Healthy Opportunities discontinuation representing limited entry potential.

Tennessee demonstrates similar platform maturity through TN Community Compass, a Findhelp deployment operating since 2015 predating RHTP by a decade. TennCare managed care organization partnerships integrate the platform into managed care contracts, creating statewide coverage. The state's $333.79 million RHTP award serves approximately 1.8 million rural residents at $185 per capita. Community health worker infrastructure operates through Tennessee Community Health Worker Association voluntary accreditation model without mandatory state certification, and Medicaid reimbursement remains absent despite mature platform deployment. Tennessee created **strong technology infrastructure without workforce financing sustainability**, presenting opposite challenge from states like Mississippi with emerging workforce policy but no platform coordination. Market opportunity remains low given platform saturation, with community health worker service development representing limited potential in workforce financing gaps.

Mississippi and Georgia present critical platform opportunities precisely because both states lack infrastructure and explicitly deprioritized social care in RHTP applications. Mississippi's $205.9 million allocation serves approximately 2.1 million rural residents at $98 per capita. The state operates no statewide closed-
