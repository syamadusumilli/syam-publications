*Orchestrating transformation through regional hubs while building on a national model for social care integration*

## Introduction

Part 1 established North Carolina's paradox: a state with the nation's second largest rural population, fresh momentum from Medicaid expansion, and $213 million in RHTP funding now faces the simultaneous unraveling of the policy infrastructure that made expansion possible. The state acknowledges that **RHTP replaces only 27% of projected rural hospital losses** under H.R. 1. This is not a solution. It is a framework for triage.

What distinguishes North Carolina's approach is its **explicit rejection of fragmented implementation** in favor of regional coordination. The centerpiece is **NC ROOTS**, a network of six locally governed hubs designed to replace the patchwork of independent providers with coordinated regional systems. The acronym captures the aspiration: **Rural Organizations Orchestrating Transformation for Sustainability**.

The plan rests on a central premise: **coordination generates efficiency that isolated providers cannot achieve**. Rather than distributing funds directly to individual facilities, North Carolina bets that regional infrastructure can multiply the impact of limited dollars while building capacity that survives beyond 2030. Whether that bet pays off depends on implementation details still being finalized as funding arrives.

## The Strategic Framework

### Governance Structure

**NCDHHS serves as lead agency** with implementation responsibility distributed across divisions. The organizational architecture reflects North Carolina's integrated approach to health transformation:

**Statewide Steering Committee**
- NC Office of Rural Health (lead coordination)
- Division of Medicaid (managed care integration)
- Division of Public Health (prevention, chronic disease)
- Division of Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities, and Substance Use Services

**Implementation Partners**
- North Carolina Community College System (workforce training)
- North Carolina Area Health Education Centers (graduate medical education)
- University partners (ECU, UNC, Duke, Wake Forest)
- Community Health Centers (primary care delivery)
- Rural Health Clinics (access points)
- Local Health Departments (public health infrastructure)

This **cross-divisional structure** matters because North Carolina's RHTP explicitly links clinical transformation to social care integration. The same administrative infrastructure that launched Medicaid expansion and the Healthy Opportunities Pilots now manages rural transformation. Institutional memory provides an advantage most states lack.

### Theory of Change

North Carolina's application articulates a **systems-level theory of change**: fragmented rural health delivery produces suboptimal outcomes regardless of funding levels. The problem is not merely insufficient resources but **insufficient coordination** among existing resources.

The logic flows as follows:
1. **Regional hubs** create shared governance and coordination infrastructure
2. **Connected providers** achieve efficiencies impossible in isolation
3. **Community voice** shapes regional priorities rather than state mandates
4. **Sustainable models** emerge from value-based payment transition
5. **Social determinants** integration addresses root causes rather than symptoms

This theory assumes that coordination costs are justified by coordination benefits, that local governance produces better decisions than state direction, and that five years provides sufficient time to build sustainable infrastructure. Part 3 will examine whether evidence supports these assumptions.

### Core Initiatives

North Carolina organizes its RHTP around **six interconnected initiatives**, each addressing a distinct dimension of rural health transformation while contributing to the integrated system:

| Initiative | Focus | Connection to Hub Model |
|------------|-------|------------------------|
| **Initiative 1** | NC ROOTS Hub Establishment | Foundation for all other initiatives |
| **Initiative 2** | Primary Care, Prevention, Chronic Disease | Clinical services coordinated through hubs |
| **Initiative 3** | Behavioral Health and Substance Use | Mental health integration via hubs |
| **Initiative 4** | Workforce Development | Training pipelines serving hub regions |
| **Initiative 5** | Value-Based Payment Models | Financial sustainability through hub contracting |
| **Initiative 6** | Technology and Digital Health | Infrastructure supporting hub coordination |

The **Rural Health Innovation Fund (RHIF)** operates across initiatives, providing technology access grants to rural providers participating in transformation activities.

## Program Allocation Table

| Program Name | Focus Area | FY2026 Allocation (Est.) | Lead Organization | Key Deliverables |
|--------------|------------|--------------------------|-------------------|------------------|

## Initiative 1: NC ROOTS Hubs

### Design and Mechanics

NC ROOTS represents North Carolina's **signature innovation**: six regional hubs serving as coordination infrastructure for all transformation activities. The acronym stands for **Rural Organizations Orchestrating Transformation for Sustainability**, signaling the state's focus on building lasting capacity rather than temporary programs.

**Hub Structure**
Each NC ROOTS Hub consists of:
- **Hub Lead**: Organization responsible for regional coordination, contract management, and performance oversight
- **Hub Network**: Participating hospitals, primary care practices, behavioral health providers, EMS agencies, local health departments, and community-based organizations
- **Community Advisory**: Local voices shaping regional priorities and implementation

**Regional Alignment**

The hubs align with North Carolina's **six Medicaid Standard Plan regions**, creating consistency between managed care administration and transformation infrastructure:

| Region | Hub Coverage | Major Population Centers | Rural Characteristics |
|--------|-------------|-------------------------|----------------------|
| Region 1 | Western NC | Asheville | Appalachian mountains, tourism economy |
| Region 2 | Northwest Piedmont | Winston-Salem, Greensboro | Transition zone, manufacturing legacy |
| Region 3 | Southwest Piedmont | Charlotte metro | Metro-adjacent rural, growth pressure |
| Region 4 | North Central | Durham, Raleigh metro | Research Triangle influence, growth corridor |
| Region 5 | Sandhills/South Central | Fayetteville | Military presence, agricultural economy |
| Region 6 | Eastern NC | Greenville, Wilmington | Coastal plain, agricultural, highest poverty |

This alignment matters for **Medicaid integration**. Standard Plans already operate regional networks. NC ROOTS creates parallel infrastructure for rural transformation that can coordinate with managed care rather than competing with it.

### Target Population and Geography

NC ROOTS serves **85 of North Carolina's 100 counties** designated as rural under HRSA criteria. The state intentionally used the **broadest federal definition** to maximize eligibility: counties with at least one census tract classified as rural.

This expansive definition has consequences. Urban-adjacent counties in the Charlotte and Research Triangle regions qualify alongside deeply rural eastern North Carolina counties with fundamentally different challenges. The hub model must accommodate this diversity through regional flexibility rather than uniform statewide programs.

**Eastern North Carolina** (Region 6) faces the most severe challenges: highest poverty rates, most rural hospital closures, longest travel distances, and least provider availability. The Martin General Hospital closure in Williamston illustrates the stakes, with attempts to reopen as a Rural Emergency Hospital testing whether federal policy innovations can restore access after closure.

### Funding Allocation

Initiative 1 receives approximately **$45 million in FY2026** for hub establishment, representing roughly 21% of the state's RHTP award. Funds support:

- Hub Lead organization identification and contracting
- Network development and provider recruitment
- Governance infrastructure and staffing
- Technical assistance and capacity building
- Performance monitoring systems

### Subawardees Under Initiative 1

Hub Leads have not been formally announced as of January 2026, but the state application identifies categories of eligible organizations:

**Potential Hub Leads**
- Regional health systems with rural service areas (e.g., Vidant/ECU Health in eastern NC)
- Hospital cooperatives or consortiums
- Regional health improvement collaboratives
- Multi-county local health department partnerships

**Hub Network Participants (Mandatory)**
- Critical Access Hospitals within the region
- Community Health Centers and Federally Qualified Health Centers
- Rural Health Clinics
- Local Health Departments
- EMS agencies
- Community-based organizations

The **competitive Hub Lead selection process** remains pending as the state finalizes the cooperative agreement with CMS. NCDHHS has indicated that Hub Leads will be responsible for subcontracting with network participants and managing regional fund flows.

### Performance Metrics

| Metric | Target | Timeline |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Hubs established | 6 | By December 2027 (PY2) |
| Eligible providers engaged | Representative share per region | PY2 |

**Core Components**
- **Primary care capitation pilots** in rural settings
- **Rural hospital alternative payment models** focused on population health
- **Practice transformation support** for value-based care readiness
- **Performance monitoring infrastructure** for outcome measurement
- **Payer coordination** with Medicaid managed care plans

### Target Population and Geography

Value-based payment transition prioritizes:
- **Rural primary care practices** currently dependent on volume
- **Critical Access Hospitals** vulnerable to census fluctuations
- **FQHCs and RHCs** positioned for capitated models
- **Provider networks** within hub regions enabling risk pooling

### Funding Allocation

Initiative 5 receives approximately **$20 million in FY2026**, supporting:

## Social Care Integration

### SDOH/HRSN Initiatives

North Carolina's RHTP **explicitly embeds social care** throughout clinical transformation initiatives. The state's existing SDOH infrastructure provides a foundation unmatched by most other RHTP recipients.

**Screening Requirements**
- NC ROOTS hubs must implement standardized SDOH screening
- Screening uses state-developed tool deployed through NCCARE360
- Hub network providers required to screen enrolled populations

**HRSN Navigation**
- Hub-based navigation coordinators connect clinical referrals to community resources
- NCCARE360 enables closed-loop referral tracking
- Navigation integrates with Medicaid managed care requirements

**Integration with Clinical Initiatives**
- Initiative 2 nutrition programs address food insecurity identified through screening
- Initiative 3 behavioral health services respond to social stressors
- Initiative 4 CHWs serve as navigation link between clinical and social services

### Healthy Opportunities Pilots Foundation

North Carolina's **Healthy Opportunities Pilots (HOP)** represent the **nation's first comprehensive Medicaid program** paying for non-medical interventions. Launched in 2022 across three regions covering 33 counties, HOP provides a model for RHTP social care integration.

**HOP Services Funded**
- Housing support (security deposits, safety modifications, utility assistance)
- Food delivery and produce prescriptions
- Transportation to medical appointments
- Interpersonal violence and toxic stress interventions

**HOP Infrastructure**
- Three Network Leads coordinating human service organizations
- Over 30,000 Medicaid members enrolled

North Carolina's administrative allocation remains **within the 10% cap** required by RHTP statute. Administrative funds support:
- NCDHHS program management staff
- Technical assistance contracts
- Performance monitoring systems
- Stakeholder engagement activities
- Reporting and compliance

### Two-Year Obligation Requirement

FY2026 funds must be obligated by **September 30, 2027**. The hub-based structure creates obligation risk:
- Hub Lead contracting must complete before major subawards
- Provider recruitment timelines vary by region
- CBO capacity building requires lead time
- Technology procurement follows competitive processes

North Carolina's first-year strategy focuses on **expanding existing programs** while hub infrastructure develops, reducing obligation risk.

### Performance Monitoring

**Metrics by Initiative** (see individual sections above)

**Cross-Initiative Indicators**
- Hub network participation rates
- Regional health outcome trends
- NCCARE360 referral and completion rates
- Medicaid managed care quality measures

**Reporting Requirements**
- Quarterly progress reports to CMS
- Annual outcome assessments
- Stakeholder feedback documentation
- Mid-program evaluation at year 3

## What the Plan Assumes

### Explicit Assumptions

North Carolina's application explicitly assumes:
- CMS approves cooperative agreement terms as proposed
- Hub Lead organizations can be identified and contracted within 6-9 months
- Providers will participate in hub networks voluntarily
- Existing infrastructure (NCCARE360, AHEC, community colleges) can scale
- Value-based payment models can generate sustainable revenue
- Technology investments produce efficiency gains justifying costs

### Implicit Assumptions

The plan implicitly assumes:
- **Medicaid expansion survives**: The entire social care integration model depends on coverage levels enabled by expansion. H.R. 1 implementation could unravel this foundation.
- **Federal partnership continues**: CMS cooperative agreement terms assume ongoing technical assistance and flexibility. Administration priorities could shift.
- **Provider capacity exists**: Hub network participation requires providers with margin to invest in transformation activities. Financially distressed facilities may lack capacity.
- **Community organizations can deliver**: Social care components depend on CBO capacity that varies dramatically by region.
- **Five years is sufficient**: Building sustainable infrastructure while simultaneously delivering services requires timeline discipline that rarely materializes.

### Dependencies on External Factors

**Federal Policy Stability**
- Medicaid coverage levels under H.R. 1 implementation
- CMS cooperative agreement flexibility
- Future RHTP reauthorization beyond 2030

**State Policy Continuity**
- Biennial budget support for matched programs
- Healthy Opportunities Pilots restoration
- Medicaid managed care contract requirements

**Economic Conditions**
- Rural hospital financial viability
- CBO operational sustainability
- Healthcare workforce labor market

### Risks Acknowledged

The application acknowledges:
- RHTP replaces only ~27% of rural hospital losses under H.R. 1
- Implementation timelines are aggressive
- Regional variation requires flexible approaches
- Sustainability beyond 2030 requires payment transformation success

### Risks Ignored

The application does not address:
- What happens if Medicaid expansion unravels
- How hub model performs if major regional provider fails
- Whether VBP transition can succeed in five years
- What social care elements survive if HOP funding is not restored

## Conclusion

North Carolina proposes a **fundamentally different approach** to RHTP implementation. Rather than distributing funds to individual providers or funding discrete programs, the state bets on **regional coordination infrastructure** that forces integration across clinical, workforce, behavioral health, and social care activities.

The NC ROOTS model has genuine promise. Coordination can generate efficiencies, local governance can improve decision-making, and integrated systems can address root causes rather than symptoms. North Carolina's existing infrastructure, including NCCARE360, the CHW certification system, and Healthy Opportunities experience, provides advantages most states lack.

But the plan also carries substantial risks. Hub establishment timelines are aggressive. Provider participation is voluntary. Social care components depend on CBO capacity that varies by region. And the entire framework rests on Medicaid coverage levels that H.R. 1 threatens to erode.

Part 3 will assess whether the plan's assumptions hold, which components survive partial funding, and whether North Carolina's coordination bet produces sustainable transformation or merely redistributes inadequate resources through a more complex administrative structure.
