South Carolina received $200 million in RHTP funding for FY2026, approximately $125 per rural resident over five years, placing it below the $164 national average. The state organized over 350 stakeholder proposals into five initiatives spanning telehealth expansion, mobile care delivery, pilot program scaling, infrastructure investment, and innovation funding. The arithmetic appears reasonable until confronting the central constraint: **South Carolina has not expanded Medicaid**. Between 65,000 and 340,000 residents fall into the coverage gap, too poor for marketplace subsidies, categorically ineligible for existing Medicaid. Six rural hospitals have closed since 2010. Seven more face closure risk within six to seven years. RHTP funding cannot fill the structural hole that non-expansion creates, as the program explicitly prohibits using funds to backfill coverage losses or provide direct care to uninsured individuals. South Carolina's transformation plan must therefore navigate an impossible constraint: building rural health infrastructure for populations who cannot afford to use it.

The state's rural health crisis follows patterns familiar from Georgia and Alabama, where the Black Belt's legacy of plantation economics and systematic disinvestment produces the nation's worst health outcomes. The difference: Georgia implemented partial Medicaid expansion in 2023. South Carolina combines **Black Belt demographics with coastal isolation** in a state that has refused every federal expansion opportunity since 2010. The Pee Dee Region in northeastern South Carolina demonstrates how hospital closure cascades through rural communities. Marlboro Park Hospital closed in 2015 with 94 beds. Chesterfield General survived only through merger with regional systems. The remaining hospitals serve populations traveling 30 to 60 miles for emergency care across a region where median household income falls below $35,000 in most counties. Marion County, Dillon County, Marlboro County, and Williamsburg County form a corridor where hospital access has collapsed while poverty, chronic disease, and population age create maximum healthcare demand.

The Lowcountry and Midlands extend the Black Belt from Georgia into South Carolina's central and southern regions. Bamberg County Memorial Hospital closed in 2012. Southern Palmetto Hospital closed in 2016. Fairfield Memorial closed in 2018. The pattern is consistent: facilities serving high-poverty populations with limited insurance coverage cannot generate revenue to sustain operations. Allendale County Hospital stands as the sole remaining independent hospital serving approximately 30,000 people across Allendale, Barnwell, and Bamberg counties. Allendale County ranks among South Carolina's poorest counties. The hospital's administrator has stated publicly that proposed Medicaid cuts would devastate operations. The infrastructure includes four Critical Access Hospitals, three small independent hospitals, 18 system-affiliated rural hospitals, over 85 Rural Health Clinics, and more than 60 rural FQHC sites. Primary care shortages affect 31 of 46 counties, mental health shortages affect 44 of 46 counties, and dental shortages affect 38 of 46 counties.

South Carolina's Medicaid eligibility rules create the coverage gap defining its rural health crisis. Parents must earn less than **67 percent of the federal poverty level** to qualify, roughly $17,300 annually for a family of three. Adults without dependent children face complete exclusion regardless of income. The coverage gap population comprises the working poor who staff restaurants, farms, warehouses, and retail establishments across rural South Carolina. Multiple estimates place this population between 65,000 and 340,000 people. What remains consistent: South Carolina contains one of the largest coverage gaps among non-expansion states when adjusted for population. These individuals earn too little for marketplace subsidies but remain categorically ineligible for Medicaid.

The South Carolina Department of Health and Human Services serves as lead agency under Governor Henry McMaster's designation. Director Robby Kerr oversees implementation. The state's five initiatives distribute approximately $1 billion over five years: Connections to Care receives roughly $250 million for telehealth and health kiosks, Wellness Within Reach receives $200 million for mobile health units, Strengthening What Works receives $150 million for scaling existing pilot programs, Building Tomorrow receives $200 million for infrastructure improvements, and Incubating Solutions receives $200 million for innovation funding and entrepreneurial pilots. The state committed to administrative costs below 5 percent, dedicating resources to direct program implementation.

The Connections to Care initiative deploys health kiosks in community settings for routine screenings and automated prescription pickup, telehealth infrastructure connecting rural patients with specialists unavailable locally, and broadband connectivity improvements for healthcare facilities. The telehealth focus addresses a real problem: rural South Carolina lacks specialists across virtually every category. Patients requiring cardiology, oncology, behavioral health, or subspecialty consultation face drives of 60 to 100 miles. Telehealth can bridge geographic distance for consultation and follow-up care, but **requires someone to pay for the visit**. For the uninsured population in the coverage gap, telehealth infrastructure creates access to services they cannot afford. This represents the fundamental tension running through South Carolina's entire approach.

Wellness Within Reach builds on Clemson Rural Health's existing mobile program serving uninsured patients at free or reduced rates. The program demonstrates both potential and limitation: only about half of Clemson Rural Health patients have insurance coverage, compared to 92 percent nationally. The mobile units depend on $2.5 million in annual state contract funding from SCDHHS. RHTP investment can expand mobile health capacity through capital funding for vehicles and equipment, but operational sustainability requires ongoing state commitment that exists only year to year. The mobile units provide primary care, screenings, and preventive services directly to communities, addressing geographic barriers that prevent rural residents from accessing care. The challenge remains that mobile units can deliver screenings that reveal conditions patients cannot afford to treat.

The Incubating Solutions initiative explicitly accepts entrepreneurial risk, potentially generating transformative approaches that conventional programs would not fund. The state acknowledges that not all innovation investments will succeed, positioning failure as acceptable cost of finding transformative models. This distinguishes South Carolina from states taking more conservative approaches. The initiative funds health technology startups and entrepreneurial approaches to rural health delivery challenges. Whether innovation can overcome structural coverage limitations remains an open question.

South Carolina's application secured competitive workload scoring through regulatory environment factors. The state maintains certificate-of-need requirements that may limit market entry for new facilities, though they also protect existing rural hospitals from competition. The state's participation in interstate licensure compacts supports telehealth workforce flexibility. Expanding telehealth policies create framework for technology-enabled care delivery. The non-expansion status creates the fundamental coverage limitation affecting all RHTP initiatives, but South Carolina avoided food assistance restrictions that reduced other states' workload scores.

The application addresses social determinants through mobile care and community outreach rather than explicit SDOH infrastructure. The approach assumes health improvements come through access expansion for populations already facing coverage barriers. Clemson Rural Health operates mobile units with community health workers serving uninsured patients, but the program depends on annual state contract funding. **South Carolina does not propose comprehensive HRSN navigation infrastructure or statewide CIE deployment**. Social care integration components remain embedded within broader mobile health initiatives rather than receiving distinct program allocation, creating vulnerability under partial funding scenarios.

Anticipated major subawardees include the South Carolina Hospital Association for technical assistance and hospital coordination, the South Carolina Primary Health Care Association for FQHC coordination, Clemson Rural Health for mobile health delivery, Medical University of South Carolina for academic partnership and telehealth hub development, CareSouth Carolina serving the Pee Dee region, McLeod Health and Prisma Health as regional and statewide health system partnerships, Regional Medical Center of Orangeburg for Lowcountry access, and local EMS organizations for mobile care integration. These partnerships create referral networks and specialist access that standalone rural facilities cannot achieve.

The strengths are genuine. Over 350 stakeholder proposals informed application development, producing broad buy-in across healthcare providers, community organizations, and local officials. Clemson Rural Health's existing mobile program provides operational infrastructure for expansion rather than building from scratch. The innovation emphasis through Incubating Solutions creates potential for transformative approaches. Telehealth investment can bridge geographic distance for consultation and follow-up care, partially compensating for specialist shortages. Regional system partnerships with McLeod Health, Prisma Health, and the Medical University of South Carolina extend reach beyond individual rural facilities.

The vulnerabilities are equally clear. **The coverage gap remains unaddressed**. Every initiative operates within the limitation that significant portions of the target population cannot afford services delivered through RHTP-funded infrastructure. Seven rural hospitals at closure risk face pressures RHTP cannot offset. The Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform identifies four facilities facing immediate closure risk within two to three years, creating urgency that five-year transformation planning cannot address. Hospital infrastructure investment helps only if hospitals survive to use it. Lack of explicit CIE investment and limited HRSN navigation capacity may constrain social care integration effectiveness. Mobile health programs require ongoing operational funding, and without state commitment beyond 2030, programs face discontinuation. The
