# South Dakota's RHTP Implementation: When Formula Advantage Meets America's Sharpest Health Divide

South Dakota's $189.5 million FY2026 Rural Health Transformation Program allocation creates a natural experiment in whether favorable per capita funding can address extreme health disparities. The state receives approximately **$486 per rural resident**, placing it among the top five states nationally for per-capita allocation and roughly **nine times what Texas receives per rural person**. This advantage stems entirely from the formula's $100 million baseline, which delivers roughly $256 per rural resident to South Dakota before any workload factors apply. With approximately 390,000 rural residents spread across 75,000 square miles, the state exemplifies the geographic bias embedded in RHTP's structure, favoring sparse populations over large ones.

Yet this funding advantage confronts one of the nation's most severe intrastate health divides. Indigenous South Dakotans who died between 2017 and 2021 had a median age of 58, **22 years younger than white South Dakotans**. Pine Ridge Reservation records life expectancy estimates ranging from 52 to 67 years depending on methodology, compared to national averages above 77 years. Diabetes mortality runs **800% higher than national rates**, cervical cancer **500% higher**, and alcoholism-related mortality **550% higher** than non-Native populations. Half of all Native Americans in South Dakota will die before age 58, while half of white South Dakotans will live past 80. This 22-year gap represents one of the largest documented health disparities within any U.S. state.

The state's RHTP approach centers on **regionalization, payment model transformation, and technology extension** to address a healthcare infrastructure concentrated in the wrong places. Seventy-seven percent of South Dakota's 40 Critical Access Hospitals cluster in eastern counties, while western communities including most reservation areas face travel distances exceeding 120 miles for basic care. The Indian Health Service operates five hospitals in the state, but only two provide routine obstetric services, and all face chronic understaffing. The fundamental tension is whether RHTP resources flow proportionately to populations experiencing the most acute crises or follow existing infrastructure toward areas already functioning relatively well.

South Dakota's application requested $1 billion over five years, including $193.3 million for the first year. The **$189.5 million award represents approximately 98% of the requested amount**, indicating strong CMS scoring of the proposal's merits. Unlike states receiving substantially less than requested, South Dakota's plan largely survived federal review intact. The five-year projection of roughly $950 million positions the state among mid-tier recipients by absolute amount but top-tier by per-capita measure. This favorable position creates genuine implementation opportunity absent in larger states forced into triage decisions.

The funding arrives as South Dakota implements Medicaid expansion approved by voters in November 2022 and effective July 2023. Initial projections anticipated 52,000 enrollees, but by October 2024 approximately **28,000 people had enrolled**, with state officials revising expectations to roughly 40,000 by 2025. The expansion provides coverage infrastructure that RHTP investments can build upon, representing both patients for transformed care delivery and revenue stability for rural providers transitioning to value-based models. However, voters subsequently approved Amendment F in 2024, authorizing the legislature to consider Medicaid work requirements pending federal waiver approval. If implemented, work requirements could cause coverage losses undermining RHTP care delivery investments, as states implementing such policies have seen significant enrollment declines.

The Medicaid context creates both opportunity and uncertainty. KFF projects federal Medicaid spending in rural South Dakota will decrease by **$487 million over the next decade** under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, primarily from new work requirements causing coverage losses. South Dakota is one of five states where RHTP funding meets or exceeds projected Medicaid cuts, creating near-neutral net position rather than the massive gaps facing states like Texas or North Carolina. This favorable position makes sustainability more plausible than in states where RHTP represents a rounding error against Medicaid reductions.

The South Dakota Department of Health serves as lead agency with direct Governor's Office involvement. Governor Larry Rhoden announced the award emphasizing collaborative development. Key partners include the South Dakota Association of Healthcare Organizations representing hospital interests, the Great Plains Tribal Leaders Health Board coordinating with nine tribal nations, major health systems Sanford and Avera covering most of the state, Monument Health in the Black Hills region, and Horizon Health operating 31 FQHC clinics across 22 communities including six reservations. The Department of Health conducted statewide Community Conversations before finalizing the application, where participants consistently identified limited access in rural communities, insufficient workforce across all fields, transportation barriers, limited dental and behavioral health services, and need for affordable local care.

The application proposed multiple programs totaling approximately **$580 million in identified initiatives** over five years. The largest single investment allocates $125 million for Regional Partnership Grants incentivizing healthcare providers to explore regional assessments, partnerships, and coordinated service delivery. The goal is sustainable regional coordination allowing hospitals and clinics to offer complementary care and strengthen financial stability rather than operating as independent competitors. EMS Regionalization receives $64 million to create regional emergency medical service hubs reducing response times and improving workforce, targeting a **15% increase in EMS workforce within two years**. Medicaid Value-Based Payment for Critical Access Hospitals receives $62.6 million to support new payment models providing more predictable revenue and rewarding quality rather than volume.

Workforce recruitment receives $62.5 million for sign-on bonuses, relocation assistance, and rural service stipends, targeting recruitment of **500 rural professionals by 2030**. Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic establishment receives $56.4 million, notable because South Dakota currently has **zero CCBHCs** providing mental health and substance use services regardless of insurance status. This initiative would establish at least one CCBHC in each behavioral health region plus mobile crisis teams and crisis stabilization facilities to reduce emergency room visits and jail holds. Chronic disease management receives $45 million for remote monitoring and interventions, maternal health hubs receive $24 million to create three regional entities using telehealth and remote monitoring, and community health worker development receives $3.5 million to develop Medicaid billing pathways and expand CHW certification beyond the current 180 certified community health representatives primarily serving tribal populations.

The social care architecture reveals notable gaps. South Dakota's application embeds social determinants considerations within clinical initiatives rather than establishing distinct SDOH programs. The Community Conversations process identified transportation, food access, and housing as significant barriers, but the resulting proposal focuses primarily on clinical access expansion through technology rather than direct social needs intervention. Unlike states proposing comprehensive Community Information Exchange platforms, South Dakota's application does not explicitly include CIE deployment. The technology emphasis focuses on telehealth expansion and remote patient monitoring rather than closed-loop referral systems for social services. The **$3.5 million CHW investment is modest relative to reservation health disparity scale**, particularly when Pine Ridge Reservation alone encompasses 2.1 million acres with per capita income around $8,768 and unemployment approaching 89% in some communities.

The tribal partnership framework demonstrates awareness but raises proportionality questions. Including the Great Plains Tribal Leaders Health Board in application development and explicitly addressing tribal areas in maternal health hub initiatives acknowledges where disparities are most severe. Horizon Health's presence on six of nine reservations provides some infrastructure foundation. However, RHTP funds flow through the state rather than directly to tribal health systems or IHS. Whether state-controlled allocation translates to proportionate investment in reservation communities experiencing 22-year life expectancy gaps remains the central implementation question. A 2022 tragedy illustrates the stakes when 12-year-old Honor Beauvais died on Rosebud Reservation after being evaluated at the IHS emergency room, released, and unable to receive emergency care when massive snowdrifts prevented ambulance access.

The workforce challenge operates at multiple scales. Over two-thirds of South Dakota is designated as a Health Professional Shortage Area for primary care, dental health, and mental health. The state reports **71 Medically Underserved Areas or Populations**. As of 2022, the state had 5,613 licensed physicians and 736 physician assistants, with 1,964 actively licensed nurse practitioners. These numbers remain insufficient for geographic coverage required across 66 counties where 34 qualify as frontier with fewer than six people per square mile. The aging healthcare workforce compounds the problem as baby boomers retire from healthcare positions while simultaneously requiring more services. State workforce programs attempt to address pipeline problems but compete against metropolitan areas offering higher compensation and broader practice opportunities.

The eastern concentration problem reflects decades of population and economic patterns unlikely to shift through transformation funding. Seventy-seven percent of Critical Access Hospitals cluster in eastern South Dakota, leaving western communities dependent on facilities more than 120 miles away. Whether regionalization strategies and technology deployment can adequately compensate for physical facility gaps in areas spanning
