This technical document provides **deep examination of the scale penalty problem** in RHTP funding distribution. The analysis demonstrates how the statutory funding formula systematically disadvantages states with large rural populations while creating per-capita windfalls for states with small rural populations.

**Per-capita funding varies nearly 100-fold across states**, from approximately $66 per rural resident in Texas to over $6,300 per rural resident in Rhode Island. This disparity fundamentally shapes what transformation is possible in each state and represents either deliberate political design or structural policy failure depending on interpretive framework.

## Part I: Funding Formula Mechanics

### Statutory Two-Part Structure

Public Law 119-21 established a two-part allocation formula distributing $10 billion annually:

| Component | Amount | Distribution Method | Result |
|-----------|--------|---------------------|--------|
| **Baseline (50%)** | $5 billion | Equal distribution to all approved states | $100 million per state |
| **Workload (50%)** | $5 billion | Rurality metrics and application scores | Variable by state |

**The equal distribution component creates the scale penalty.** A state with 100,000 rural residents receives the same $100 million baseline as a state with 5 million rural residents. Per-capita funding from the baseline alone ranges from $1,000 per resident (small rural population) to $20 per resident (large rural population) before any workload factors apply.

### Workload Allocation Factors

CMS distributes the workload portion based on multiple factors, with weights disclosed in the Notice of Funding Opportunity:

**Rurality and State Need (approximately 50% of workload funding)**

| Factor | Weight Within Category | Favored States |
|--------|----------------------|----------------|
| Land area (5 largest states) | 12% | AK, TX, CA, MT, NM |
| Share of population in rural areas | 12% | Percentage-based, not absolute |
| Share of population in frontier regions | 12% | Extreme isolation states |
| Number of rural health facilities | Variable | States with more CAHs, RHCs, FQHCs |
| Medicaid DSH hospital share | 20% | States with high DSH payments (2021 data) |

**Technical Application Scores (approximately 50% of workload funding)**

| Factor | Weight Within Category | Assessment |
|--------|----------------------|------------|
| Transformation plan quality | Variable | CMS technical review |
| MAHA policy alignment | Variable | SNAP restrictions, fitness test, prevention |
| Stakeholder engagement | Variable | Documentation of consultation |
| Prior program performance | Variable | Flex, SHIP, other rural health programs |

### What the Formula Rewards

The formula creates systematic advantages for states with:

**Geographic characteristics:**
- Large land area relative to population
- High percentage of population in rural areas (not absolute rural population)
- Frontier designation (under 6 persons per square mile)
- Extreme isolation metrics (FAR Level 3-4)

**Policy alignment:**
- SNAP purchase restrictions adopted or proposed
- Presidential Fitness Test commitment
- Prevention and chronic disease initiatives
- MAHA priorities in application narrative

**Formula design does not reward:**
- Absolute rural population size
- Health outcomes or mortality rates
- Hospital closure risk or vulnerability
- Coverage gaps or uninsured rates
- Poverty concentration or persistent poverty counties

## Part II: Per-Capita Calculation Methodology

### Data Sources

Per-capita calculations require consistent rural population definitions. This analysis uses:

**Primary Source:** KFF analysis using Sheps Center rural population data (CMS definition for RHTP formula purposes)

**Secondary Verification:** Census Bureau American Community Survey, USDA ERS rural-urban classifications

**Award Data:** CMS December 29, 2025 announcement as compiled by U.S. Chamber of Commerce

### Calculation Formula

```
Per-Capita Funding = FY2026 RHTP Award / Rural Population (CMS definition)

Five-Year Per-Capita = (FY2026 Award Ã— 5) / Rural Population
```

**Note:** Five-year projections assume constant annual awards, though actual awards will be recalculated annually based on state performance and compliance.

### Definition Considerations

Rural population definitions vary across federal agencies. The CMS definition for RHTP purposes differs from:

- Census Bureau rural definition (all territory outside urbanized areas)
- USDA ERS nonmetro definition (counties outside metropolitan statistical areas)
- State-specific definitions used in some applications

**Consistency note:** All per-capita figures in this document use the CMS definition as applied in formula calculations, based on Sheps Center data.

### Distribution by Funding Tier

| Tier | Per-Capita Range | States | Count |
|------|------------------|--------|-------|
| **Extreme High** | Over $500 | RI, NJ, AK, CT, DE, MA, WY, SD | 8 |
| **High** | $300 to $500 | NH, HI, MT, VT, ND, MD, NV, FL, ME, NE | 10 |
| **Moderate** | $150 to $300 | ID, UT, CO, KS, OR, NM, OK, AZ, WV, IA, WA, AR, LA, MN, WI | 15 |
| **Low** | $100 to $150 | MS, SC, IN, KY, MO, VA, PA, NY | 8 |
| **Very Low** | Under $100 | AL, TN, CA, MI, IL, OH, GA, NC, TX | 9 |

**KFF finding:** Ten states receive less than $100 per rural resident while eight states receive more than $500 per rural resident.

## Part IV: Disparity Analysis

### The 100-Fold Gap

The ratio between highest and lowest per-capita funding approaches **100:1** when comparing Rhode Island ($6,305) to Texas ($65). Even excluding Rhode Island as an extreme outlier, the ratio between New Jersey ($1,069) and Texas ($65) exceeds **16:1**.

| Comparison | High | Low | Ratio |
|------------|------|-----|-------|
| Rhode Island vs. Texas | $6,305 | $65 | 97:1 |
| New Jersey vs. Texas | $1,069 | $65 | 16:1 |
| Alaska vs. Texas | $990 | $65 | 15:1 |
| Wyoming vs. Texas | $554 | $65 | 9:1 |
| Median state vs. Texas | ~$200 | $65 | 3:1 |

### Five-Year Projection Disparities

Assuming constant annual awards, five-year per-capita disparities compound:

| State | Five-Year Total | Five-Year Per Capita |
|-------|----------------|---------------------|
| Rhode Island | $780.8M | $31,525 |
| New Jersey | $736.3M | $5,345 |
| Alaska | $1.36B | $4,950 |
| Wyoming | $1.03B | $2,770 |
| Texas | $1.41B | $325 |
| California | $1.17B | $433 |
| North Carolina | $1.07B | $315 |

**Wyoming receives $2,770 per rural resident over five years. Texas receives $325.** Wyoming's rural population of 370,000 receives nearly as much total funding as Texas's rural population of 4.3 million.

### Inverse Relationship with Health Need

The Penn Leonard Davis Institute analysis for Senator Ron Wyden's office found that **states with the lowest rural mortality rates receive approximately twice as much RHTP funding per rural resident** as states with the highest rural mortality rates.

| Health Outcome Category | Average Per-Capita Funding | Representative States |
|------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| **Lowest mortality rates** | ~$400 | NH, VT, HI, CO |
| **Moderate mortality rates** | ~$200 | National average |
| **Highest mortality rates** | ~$100 | MS, AL, WV, KY |

The formula rewards geographic sparsity and policy alignment rather than health crisis severity.

## Part V: Geographic vs. Population Weighting Effects

### How Equal Distribution Creates Scale Penalty

The $100 million baseline per state creates automatic per-capita advantage for small-population states:

| State | Rural Population | Baseline Per Capita | Baseline as % of Total Award |
|-------|------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| Rhode Island | 24,770 | $4,037 | 64% |
| Texas | 4,300,000 | $23 | 36% |
| Alaska | 274,924 | $364 | 37% |
| California | 2,700,000 | $37 | 43% |

**Rhode Island receives more from the baseline alone** ($4,037 per resident) than Texas receives in total ($65 per resident).

### Workload Factors Compound Rather Than Correct

The workload portion uses percentage-based rurality metrics rather than absolute population:

**Example:** Montana and Texas both have significant rural populations, but Montana's rural population represents a higher **percentage** of state population. The formula rewards Montana's 44% rural share over Texas's 17% rural share, even though Texas has eight times more rural residents.

| State | Rural Population | Rural % of State | Workload Advantage |
|-------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Montana | 550,000 | 52% | High (percentage-based) |
| Texas | 4,300,000 | 15% | Low (percentage-based) |
| Mississippi | 1,598,000 | 54% | High (percentage-based) |
| California | 2,700,000 | 7% | Very Low (percentage-based) |

### Frontier and FAR Code Effects

Frontier designation (under 6 persons per square mile) and Frontier and Remote Area (FAR) codes provide additional weighting:

| FAR Level | Criteria | Advantaged States |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| FAR 1 | Urban core accessible | Minimal advantage |
| FAR 2 | Large town accessible | Moderate advantage |
| FAR 3 | Small town accessible | Significant advantage |
| FAR 4 | Most isolated | Maximum advantage |

**Alaska, Wyoming, Montana, and Nevada** contain significant FAR Level 3-4 territory, receiving formula benefits unavailable to states with concentrated rural populations like Texas or California.

## Part VI: Rural Population Definitions and Impact

### Definition Variation

Rural population counts vary by definition:

| State | Census Rural | USDA Nonmetro | CMS RHTP Definition |
|-------|-------------|---------------|---------------------|
| Texas | 3.1M | 2.8M | 4.3M |
| California | 2.0M | 1.4M | 2.7M |
| Florida | 1.2M | 0.5M | 0.66M |
| New York | 2.2M | 1.7M | 2.0M |

**CMS uses broader definitions than USDA** in some states, affecting per-capita calculations. The broader definition typically reduces per-capita funding by increasing the denominator.

### Impact on State Rankings

Definition choice affects ranking position. Using narrower USDA nonmetro definitions would:

- Increase Florida's per-capita funding (smaller denominator)
- Decrease Texas's per-capita ranking slightly
- Potentially shift several states between tiers

**This document uses CMS definitions for consistency with RHTP formula applications.**

## Part VII: Policy Implications

### What Scale Penalty Means for Implementation

**States receiving under $100 per rural resident face fundamentally different implementation contexts:**

| Challenge | High Per-Capita State | Low Per-Capita State |
|-----------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Transformation scope | Comprehensive | Limited pilots |
| Program reach | Statewide | Regional targeting |
| Workforce investment | Sustained pipelines | One-time recruitment |
| Technology deployment | Infrastructure build | Equipment only |
| Sustainability | Achievable | Uncertain |

**Texas cannot accomplish what Alaska can** with available funding despite facing more hospital closures, larger coverage gaps, and higher preventable mortality.

### Alternative Formula Scenarios

**Scenario A: Pure Population-Based Allocation**

If $10 billion were allocated purely by rural population (46 million nationally):

| State | Rural Population | Allocation | Per Capita |
|-------|------------------|------------|------------|
| Texas | 4,300,000 | $935M | $217 |
| North Carolina | 3,400,000 | $739M | $217 |
| Rhode Island | 24,770 | $5.4M | $217 |
| Alaska | 274,924 | $60M | $217 |

**Result:** Equal per-capita funding across all states. Small states receive dramatically less total funding.

**Scenario B: Need-Weighted Allocation**

If allocation weighted by mortality rates, hospital risk, and coverage gaps:

| State | Health Need Score | Illustrative Allocation | Per Capita |
|-------|-------------------|------------------------|------------|
| Mississippi | Highest | ~$400M | $250 |
| Texas | Very High | ~$700M | $163 |
| Alaska | Moderate | ~$100M | $364 |
| Rhode Island | Low | ~$20M | $808 |

**Result:** Higher per-capita funding for high-need states; formula would reward crisis severity rather than geography.

**Scenario C: Hybrid 25/75 (Current Law Baseline Reduced)**

If baseline reduced to 25% with 75% workload allocation emphasizing absolute population:

| Component | Current | Scenario C |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| Equal distribution | 50% ($5B) | 25% ($2.5B) |
| Population-weighted | 5% | 35% |
| Rurality metrics | 20% | 20% |
| Technical scores | 25% | 20% |

**Result:** Reduced scale penalty; large rural states receive more proportionate funding while small states retain floor.

### Political Reality

**The current formula reflects legislative compromise, not optimal policy design.**

Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) was instrumental in program creation and secured formula provisions benefiting Alaska. Every senator wanted substantial funding for their state regardless of rural population size. Pure population-based allocation would have concentrated 80% of funding in 15 states, making passage politically impossible.

**The formula is working as designed politically** even if it creates inequitable per-capita outcomes.

### Formula Reform Advocacy

Organizations advocating formula modification face structural barriers:

| Barrier | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Statutory requirement** | Formula is in law, not regulation; change requires legislation |
| **Political coalition** | Small-state senators benefit from current formula |
| **Timing** | Program already distributing funds; mid-stream changes disrupt planning |
| **Reauthorization** | Program expires 2030; reform opportunity in reauthorization |

**NRHA and other advocacy organizations** have noted formula inequities but focused on program utilization rather than formula reform given short-term implementation timeline.

## Part VIII: Analytical Applications

### Using Per-Capita Data in State Profiles

Each Series 3 state profile should document:

**Per-Capita Funding Block**
```
FY2026 Award: [Amount]
Rural Population: [Count]
Per Rural Resident: [Calculated]
National Ranking: [1-50]
Funding Tier: [Extreme High/High/Moderate/Low/Very Low]
Five-Year Per Capita: [Projected]
```

### Transformation Capacity Classification

| Per-Capita Tier | Transformation Capacity | Implementation Expectation |
|-----------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Over $500** | Comprehensive | Statewide transformation achievable |
| **$300 to $500** | Strong | Major initiatives across multiple domains |
| **$150 to $300** | Moderate | Targeted transformation with regional gaps |
| **$100 to $150** | Limited | Demonstration projects, select initiatives |
| **Under $100** | Constrained | Pilot programs, supplements to existing efforts |

### Cross-Reference Matrix

| Per-Capita Tier | Typical Medicaid Gap Class | Implementation Outlook |
|-----------------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| **Over $500** | Often Positive | Resources adequate for transformation |
| **$300 to $500** | Often Low | Strong position for meaningful change |
| **$150 to $300** | Often Moderate | Viable transformation with triage |
| **$100 to $150** | Often Moderate to Severe | Significant constraints |
| **Under $100** | Often Severe to Extreme | RHTP insufficient for need |

### Calculation Limitations

**Per-capita calculations carry limitations:**

- Rural population definitions vary; this analysis uses CMS RHTP definitions
- Annual awards will be recalculated; five-year projections assume constant allocation
- Technical score component changes annually based on state performance
- Some rural population estimates carry uncertainty ranges

**Ranking precision note:** States with similar per-capita values (within $10) should be considered equivalent for analytical purposes. Precise ranking position less important than funding tier classification.

### Update Schedule

This document requires revision when:
- CMS releases FY2027 or subsequent year awards
