*Rural Health Transformation Project*
*Version 3: January 2026*

## Purpose

This technical document serves as a **master reference documenting who receives RHTP funding** across all 50 states. The document enables:

1. **Cross-state comparison** of intermediary structures and program types
2. **Identification of key organizations** operating in the RHTP ecosystem
3. **Analysis of funding distribution patterns** from state agencies to end recipients
4. **Tracking of implementation models** across different state contexts

Understanding where money flows reveals more about RHTP implementation than headline award figures. States channel billions through intermediary organizations, and these distribution decisions shape what transformation actually looks like on the ground.

## Section 1: Intermediary Organization Inventory

### State Hospital Associations

State hospital associations serve as **primary intermediaries** in most RHTP implementations, providing technical assistance to member hospitals, coordinating network formation, and advocating for policy alignment.

| State | Hospital Association | RHTP Role | Estimated Contract |
|-------|---------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Texas** | Texas Hospital Association | Policy alignment, member engagement | Key stakeholder |
| **Texas** | TORCH (Texas Organization of Rural & Community Hospitals) | Rural hospital coordination, telehealth network | $15-25M (est.) |
| **California** | California Hospital Association | Technical assistance, network coordination, policy advocacy | $8-12M |
| **Mississippi** | Mississippi Hospital Association | Hospital engagement, technical assistance | $10-15M (est.) |
| **Ohio** | Ohio Hospital Association | Technical assistance, network coordination, CAH support | $8-12M |
| **Georgia** | Georgia Hospital Association | Technical assistance, policy coordination | TBD |

## Section 3: Funding Distribution Patterns

### Intermediary Versus Direct Award Ratios

States vary dramatically in how much funding flows through intermediary organizations versus direct awards to providers.

| State | Via Intermediaries | Direct to Providers | Administrative | Distribution Model |
|-------|-------------------|--------------------|-----------------|--------------------|
| **California** | 40-50% | 40-50% | 10% | Balanced |
| **Texas** | 20-30% | 60-70% | 7-9% | Provider-heavy |
| **Arkansas** | 50-60% | 30-40% | ~3% | Intermediary-heavy |
| **Missouri** | 60-70% | 20-30% | ~5% | Intermediary-heavy |
| **Ohio** | 30-40% | 50-60% | ~10% | Balanced |
| **West Virginia** | 40-50% | 40-50% | ~5% | Balanced |
| **Wisconsin** | 30-40% | 50-60% | ~5% | Provider-heavy |

**Pattern observed:** States with established intermediary infrastructure (Missouri with ToRCH, Arkansas with UAMS/Arkansas Rural Health Partnership) channel more funding through these organizations. States relying on competitive procurement (Texas) direct more funding to individual providers.

### Administrative Retention Rates

| State | Administrative Budget | Percentage | FTEs | Assessment |
|-------|----------------------|------------|------|------------|
| **Texas** | $20-25M | 7-9% | ~20 | Moderate |
| **California** | ~$25M | ~10% | TBD | Higher |
| **Arkansas** | $28.2M | 2.8% | TBD | Low |
| **Ohio** | ~$20M | ~10% | TBD | Higher |
| **Missouri** | ~$8M | ~3% | 20-25 | Low |
| **West Virginia** | ~$10M | ~5% | TBD | Low-Moderate |

**Pattern observed:** States with larger existing administrative infrastructure (Ohio Department of Health, California HCAI) retain higher administrative percentages. States with lean administration (Arkansas at 2.8%) may face implementation capacity constraints.

### Performance-Based Versus Block Allocation

| State | Performance-Based | Block Allocation | Notes |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|-------|
| **California** | Transformative Payments (access metrics), quality metrics | Infrastructure, training, network coordination | Hybrid approach |
| **Texas** | Subawardee milestones | Infrastructure investments | Milestone-based |
| **Tennessee** | CHW organization accreditation | County Health Council grants | Accreditation-based |
| **North Carolina** | Hub performance metrics | RHIF technology grants | Hub outcomes |
| **Missouri** | ToRCH hub outcomes | Infrastructure grants | Hub-based |
| **Wisconsin** | CHW ROI study informs SPA | Workforce, technology grants | Research-informed |

### Timeline Patterns for Fund Distribution

| Phase | Texas | California | Arkansas | Missouri |
|-------|-------|------------|----------|----------|
| **Q1-Q2 FY2026** | RFP development | Network formation contracts | Program establishment | Hub expansion RFPs |
| **Q3-Q4 FY2026** | Application, review, selection | Technology procurement, workforce launch | Initial RFPs, awards | Initial awards |
| **Q1-Q2 FY2027** | Contract execution, implementation | Full network operations | Initiative launches | Full implementation |
| **Q3-Q4 FY2027** | Full operation | Performance assessment | Scaling | Performance assessment |

## Section 4: Cross-State Program Comparison

### Similar Programs Across Multiple States

**Hub-and-Spoke Networks**

| State | Hub Model | Number of Hubs | Hub Functions | Spoke Integration |
|-------|-----------|----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **California** | Regional Hospital Networks | 8 networks | Specialty access, telehealth, coordination | Rural hospitals, FQHCs |
| **Ohio** | Innovation Hubs | 8-10 hubs | Specialty pods, care coordination | Spoke hospitals, clinics |
| **Missouri** | ToRCH Community Hubs | 40+ hubs (from 6 pilot) | Social needs coordination, referrals | Community partners |
| **North Carolina** | Regional Innovation Hubs | 6 regional hubs | Network management, specialty access | Primary care, FQHCs |
| **Kentucky** | Chronic Care Hubs | Multiple | Chronic disease management, navigation | CHWs, primary care |
| **Alabama** | CRIS Regional Hubs | TBD | Community-based services | Rural providers |

**Workforce Loan Repayment Programs**

| State | Program Name | Award Amount | Service Commitment | Disciplines |
|-------|-------------|--------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Texas** | Workforce Pipeline | Varies | 5 years rural practice | Physicians, NPs, PAs, nurses |
| **California** | Regional Facility Retention | Varies | Rural practice commitment | Multiple disciplines |
| **Ohio** | Ohio Physician Loan Repayment (enhanced) | Expanded | 5 years rural | Physicians, NPs, PAs, BH, dentists |
| **West Virginia** | Return-to-Home Scholarships | In-state tuition | Equal years rural practice | Multiple disciplines |
| **Arkansas** | UAMS Programs | Varies | Rural service commitment | Multiple disciplines |

**Community Paramedicine/Mobile Integrated Health**

| State | Program | Focus | EMS Integration |
|-------|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **Texas** | Not explicit | N/A | N/A |
| **Ohio** | Mobile Integrated Health | High-risk patient care, treat-in-place | EMS protocol development |
| **West Virginia** | MIH/CP | Care extension, treat-in-place | Community college training |
| **Tennessee** | Community Paramedicine | Transport alternative | TBD |
| **North Carolina** | EMS Pipeline | EMT training, community paramedicine | Hub integration |

### Funding Variation for Comparable Initiatives

**Telehealth Infrastructure Investment**

| State | Telehealth Allocation | Rural Population | Per-Capita Investment |
|-------|----------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| **Texas** | $65-75M | 4.7M | $14-16 |
| **California** | $152M | 2.7M | $56 |
| **Arkansas** | ~$80M | 1.3M | $62 |
| **Wisconsin** | $205M + $85M | 1.4M | $207 |

**Pattern observed:** Wisconsin's technology investment dramatically exceeds other states on a per-capita basis, reflecting the Rural Technology Transformation Fund and Rural Health Care Collaborative as centerpiece initiatives.

**CHW Program Investment**

| State | CHW Allocation | FTE Target | Cost per CHW Position |
|-------|---------------|------------|----------------------|
| **Texas** | $9-12M | 300 employed | $30-40K |
| **California** | $8-12M | 250-400 | $30-40K |
| **Wisconsin** | $60M | Pilot-based | N/A (includes SPA development) |
| **Tennessee** | ~$8-10M | 60-100 | $80-100K (org accreditation) |

**Pattern observed:** Tennessee's higher per-CHW cost reflects organizational accreditation approach rather than direct CHW support. Wisconsin's allocation includes Medicaid State Plan Amendment development for long-term sustainability.
