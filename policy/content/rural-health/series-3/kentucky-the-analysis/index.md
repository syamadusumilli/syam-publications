Part 2 documented Kentucky's five-initiative RHTP strategy: **Rural Community Hubs for Chronic Care** ($35-45M), **PoWERing Maternal and Infant Health** ($40-50M), **Rapid Response to Recovery/EmPATH** ($45-55M), **Rooted in Health Dental Access** ($25-35M), and **Crisis to Care EMS Integration** ($30-40M). The **Kentucky Department for Public Health** leads implementation through an A3 Team structure, channeling approximately $212.9 million annually through university health systems, community mental health centers, FQHCs, and community-based organizations.

This analysis evaluates what actually works, what struggles against implementation headwinds, and what gets cut when plans meet reality. The framework applies **pragmatic realism**: acknowledging what RHTP can achieve in Kentucky while refusing to pretend that $114 per rural resident transforms healthcare for 1.87 million people in a state with **35 rural hospitals at risk of closure**, more than any other state nationally.

**Central question**: Can Kentucky's strategically interconnected initiatives produce meaningful health improvement, or do structural constraints (Medicaid cuts, workforce shortages, hospital fragility, Appalachian health disparities) doom the Commonwealth to administered activity without transformed outcomes?

The evidence suggests **selective success**: certain initiatives will achieve measurable impact, others will struggle against barriers Kentucky cannot control, and social care integration will survive as embedded components rather than standalone programming. The **Medicaid math** remains the constraint that RHTP cannot address. Kentucky's $212.9 million annual investment cannot offset $3.8 billion in projected annual Medicaid losses by decade's end.

## What Works

### EmPATH Model Replication

**Assessment: Strong Survival Probability**

Kentucky's **Rapid Response to Recovery initiative** builds on proven infrastructure rather than experimental concepts. UK HealthCare opened Kentucky's first EmPATH unit in July 2024 at Eastern State Hospital in Lexington. Data from the first six months demonstrates the model works in Kentucky's context.

**Why it works**:

The UK HealthCare EmPATH unit has already served **more than 2,700 individuals** since opening. The average length of stay is 15 hours, well within the 23-hour observation window. Patients have presented from **66 Kentucky counties and 28 states**, demonstrating regional reach beyond Lexington. Most patients return home after stabilization with community resources, avoiding unnecessary hospitalization.

**Outcome data validates the approach.** The rate of individuals keeping follow-up appointments averages **61%, compared with a baseline of 29% before EmPATH**, more than doubling engagement with outpatient care. National EmPATH data shows **60-80% of patients stabilize within 24 hours** without requiring inpatient admission. UK HealthCare reports decreased readmission rates at Eastern State Hospital and reduced behavioral health presentations at Good Samaritan Hospital's emergency department.

**The model addresses real workforce constraints.** Kentucky cannot recruit enough psychiatrists to staff rural areas. EmPATH concentrates scarce psychiatric capacity in stabilization units while deploying mobile crisis teams and telepsychiatry to extend reach. This hybrid model matches workforce reality rather than ignoring it.

**RHTP funds regional replication.** The $45-55 million behavioral health allocation supports mobile crisis response teams, telepsychiatry expansion, and **EmPATH unit replication** in regional centers beyond Lexington. Integration with **988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline** creates a coordinated crisis continuum from hotline to stabilization to outpatient treatment.

**Risk factors**: EmPATH replication requires physical infrastructure, specialized staffing, and coordination with community mental health centers. Mobile crisis response depends on **Community Mental Health Center capacity**, which faces its own workforce shortages. Success at UK HealthCare does not guarantee equivalent performance in regional facilities lacking academic medical center resources.

### Kentucky Homeplace CHW Expansion

**Assessment: Strong Survival Probability**

The **Rural Community Hubs initiative** deploys community health workers through **Kentucky Homeplace**, the Commonwealth's longest-running CHW program. Unlike initiatives requiring proof of concept, Kentucky Homeplace has **30 years of documented outcomes**.

**Why it works**:

Kentucky Homeplace demonstrates **return on investment of $11.33 for every $1 invested**, based on cumulative data from 2001 through 2024. The program has served **more than 202,000 rural Kentuckians** and provided **5.3 million services** with combined medication and service value exceeding $416 million. A 2016-2018 pilot program with WellCare documented **10% reduction in emergency room visits, 13% reduction in non-emergency ER visits, and 23% decrease in inpatient admissions** among participants with chronic disease diagnoses.

**CHW certification infrastructure already exists.** The **Kentucky Office of Community Health Workers** administers state certification, with 252 certified CHWs employed across the Commonwealth as of early 2024. RHTP funding expands an existing workforce rather than creating new certification pipelines. Kentucky Homeplace currently employs 21-26 CHWs covering 26-30 eastern Kentucky counties; RHTP enables expansion to additional counties and increased staffing density.

**Medicaid reimbursement provides sustainability pathway.** Kentucky joined states enabling Medicaid reimbursement for CHW services following 2022 legislation (HB 525). Healthcare systems, FQHCs, and community mental health centers can now bill Medicaid for CHW-delivered services. This reimbursement mechanism creates potential post-RHTP sustainability that grant-funded programs typically lack.

**Risk factors**: CHW expansion depends on recruitment from communities where employment options are limited but healthcare workforce interest may also be limited. Training pipelines require 6-12 months to produce certified workers. Supervision requirements mean CHW deployment scales with clinical workforce capacity, creating a dependency that may constrain growth.

### Telehealth Infrastructure Consolidation

**Assessment: Strong Survival Probability**

Kentucky's initiatives embed telehealth across **all five program areas**: chronic care remote monitoring, maternal telehealth consultations, telepsychiatry for behavioral health, tele-dental consultations, and EMS data connectivity. This distributed approach consolidates infrastructure investment rather than creating standalone telehealth programs.

**Why it works**:

**Telehealth extends proven capabilities.** UK HealthCare and UofL Health operate established telehealth networks. RHTP investment expands capacity for specialty consultations (maternal-fetal medicine, psychiatry, dental) that rural facilities cannot provide locally. Remote patient monitoring for chronic disease management enables continuous engagement between hub visits.

**Multiple payment streams support sustainability.** Telehealth reimbursement expanded dramatically during COVID-19 and many flexibilities became permanent. Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial payers now cover telehealth services that were restricted pre-pandemic. Kentucky's investment builds infrastructure that can be sustained through fee-for-service reimbursement after RHTP.

**Broadband expansion creates enabling conditions.** Kentucky has invested heavily in broadband infrastructure through federal programs. While coverage gaps persist, particularly in Appalachian hollows, the trajectory supports increasing telehealth viability. RHTP investment assumes continued broadband improvement rather than working against infrastructure trends.

**Risk factors**: Broadband limitations persist in the most isolated communities that need telehealth most. Device literacy and technology comfort vary among elderly populations with highest chronic disease burden. Telehealth cannot fully substitute for in-person care, particularly for physical examinations, procedures, and hands-on treatment.

## What Struggles

### Dental Workforce Pipeline

**Assessment: Moderate Struggle Expected**

The **Rooted in Health initiative** seeks to expand dental access through dental hygiene training at **Kentucky Community and Technical College System (KCTCS)** campuses, portable dental clinics, and tele-dental consultation. The strategy addresses real need: Appalachian Kentucky has among the worst oral health outcomes nationally, and **all 120 Kentucky counties** are designated dental Health Professional Shortage Areas.

**Why it struggles**:

**Training pipelines produce graduates slowly.** Dental hygiene programs typically require two years. Expanded cohorts at KCTCS campuses beginning in 2026 produce graduates in 2028 at earliest. Kentucky cannot train its way out of dental shortages within RHTP's five-year window. The initiative invests in long-term workforce development while immediate access gaps persist.

**Portable clinics face operational challenges.** Mobile dental equipment requires maintenance, supplies, and staffing. Each portable clinic needs a supervising dentist, limiting scalability to available dentist workforce. Travel time between service locations reduces efficiency compared with fixed-site delivery. Weather, road conditions, and equipment breakdowns create service interruptions.

**Scope of practice limitations constrain dental hygienists.** Kentucky requires dentist supervision for most dental hygiene services. Unlike states with **direct access provisions** allowing hygienists to practice independently in certain settings, Kentucky's scope rules mean dental hygiene expansion still depends on dentist availability. Legislative changes could expand scope, but such changes are uncertain.

**Cultural factors affect utilization.** Oral health has historically received lower priority than medical care in Appalachian communities. Dental fear and distrust are documented barriers. Building demand for preventive dental services requires community engagement beyond service availability.

**Realistic expectation**: The dental initiative will expand access incrementally, particularly through portable clinics serving school-based and community settings. Workforce pipeline investments will yield returns after 2028. The initiative will not solve Appalachian oral health disparities within RHTP's timeframe but may establish infrastructure for longer-term improvement.

### EMS Workforce and Integration

**Assessment: Moderate Struggle Expected**

The **Crisis to Care initiative** addresses EMS workforce shortages through paramedic training, treat-in-place protocols, and data connectivity enabling care coordination. Kentucky's EMS crisis is real: **half of all paramedics statewide work in the five largest counties**, leaving rural areas dependent on volunteer services and basic EMTs.

**Why it struggles**:

**Treat-in-place protocols require clinical backup.** Enabling paramedics to treat patients in place rather than transport requires standing orders, medical direction, and destination facilities willing to accept patients without ambulance arrival. Rural hospitals already operating at capacity may resist becoming destinations for treat-in-place referrals. Protocol development and medical direction agreements require extensive stakeholder negotiation.

**Compensation cannot compete with urban markets.** Rural EMS agencies cannot match urban salaries. Paramedics trained through RHTP-funded programs may obtain certification and relocate to better-paying positions in Lexington, Louisville, or out of state. Training investments may benefit the broader EMS workforce without addressing rural retention.

**Volunteer EMS culture resists professionalization.** Many rural Kentucky communities depend on volunteer fire departments providing EMS. Professionalizing EMS through paid paramedic positions may conflict with volunteer traditions and local funding structures. Community resistance to changing EMS models could slow implementation.

**Data connectivity depends on hospital participation.** Electronic patient care reporting (ePCR) integration requires receiving facilities to participate in data exchange. Rural hospitals with limited IT capacity may struggle to implement real-time data sharing. Privacy concerns and competitive dynamics between systems complicate information exchange.

**Realistic expectation**: EMS training will expand the paramedic workforce, though retention will vary. Treat-in-place protocols will succeed in communities with supportive hospital partners but face resistance elsewhere. Data connectivity will improve incrementally as hospitals upgrade capabilities. The initiative addresses symptoms of EMS crisis without solving root causes of rural recruitment and retention.

### Hub-and-Spoke Chronic Care Coordination

**Assessment: Moderate Struggle Expected**

The **Rural Community Hubs initiative** establishes hub-and-spoke networks for chronic disease management, initially targeting **obesity and diabetes**. Hubs provide clinical coordination, nutrition services, physical activity programming, and CHW deployment while spoke sites maintain local patient relationships.

**Why it struggles**:

**Coordination models require sustained attention.** Hub-and-spoke arrangements work when hub resources genuinely support spoke activities rather than simply centralizing services. Many "hub-and-spoke" implementations become hub-centric, with spoke sites receiving referral pathways but limited tangible support. Maintaining true collaboration requires ongoing relationship investment beyond initial network formation.

**Chronic disease management requires patient engagement.** Unlike acute care where patients seek treatment, chronic disease management depends on patient participation in lifestyle changes, medication adherence, and follow-up visits. Engagement rates in diabetes and obesity programs vary widely. Kentucky's target populations include individuals with limited health literacy, transportation barriers, and competing life demands that affect participation.

**Nutrition programming faces food environment barriers.** Rural Kentucky includes food deserts where healthy options are unavailable regardless of nutrition education. SNAP and food assistance help but cannot transform local food environments within RHTP's timeframe. Nutrition programming may increase knowledge without changing behavior when healthy options remain inaccessible or unaffordable.

**Physical activity requires infrastructure.** Walking programs succeed where safe walking routes exist. Rural communities often lack sidewalks, lighting, and pedestrian infrastructure. Weather limits outdoor activity seasonally. Indoor exercise options require facilities that rural communities may lack.

**Realistic expectation**: Hub networks will form and provide coordination infrastructure. Participant enrollment will meet targets. Health outcomes improvement will be modest and concentrated among individuals with higher baseline engagement and fewer structural barriers. The initiative will demonstrate proof of concept without achieving population-level transformation.

## What Gets Cut

### Ambitious Geographic Coverage

**Triage decision**: Kentucky's application describes statewide reach, but implementation will concentrate in priority regions. Eastern Kentucky and designated Appalachian counties will receive disproportionate investment given documented need. Western Kentucky and suburban fringe counties will receive less attention despite rural designation.

**Rationale**: Limited resources require prioritization. Spreading investment too thinly produces no measurable impact anywhere. Concentration in highest-need areas generates demonstrable outcomes that can justify continued investment. Geographic triage is implicit in any program that cannot serve all communities equally.

**Consequence**: Rural Kentuckians outside priority regions may see limited benefit from RHTP. Health disparities between Appalachian and non-Appalachian rural areas may persist or widen.

### Full Workforce Pipeline Development

**Triage decision**: Training programs will launch, but cohort sizes will likely be smaller than application ambitions suggested. Dental hygiene, paramedic, and CHW training will expand incrementally rather than transformationally.

**Rationale**: Training pipelines face instructor shortages, facility constraints, and clinical placement limitations. Producing more graduates requires more training capacity that cannot be created instantly. Realistic cohort sizes match institutional capacity rather than theoretical need.

**Consequence**: Workforce shortages will persist throughout RHTP's five-year window. Training investments yield returns after 2028, assuming graduates remain in Kentucky.

### Technology Platform Integration

**Triage decision**: Technology components will be implemented but may not achieve full interoperability. Remote patient monitoring, EMS data connectivity, and referral platforms will operate but may not seamlessly integrate.

**Rationale**: Technology integration across multiple vendor platforms, health systems, and agency databases requires substantial technical effort. Competing priorities, limited IT staff, and budget constraints will likely result in functional but siloed systems rather than unified data infrastructure.

**Consequence**: Care coordination will depend on human communication rather than automated data sharing. Efficiency gains from technology integration will be limited.

## Social Care Survival Assessment

### The Partial Funding Question

Kentucky received **$212,908,935** for fiscal year 2026, representing the full requested amount. Unlike states receiving partial awards requiring immediate triage, Kentucky can implement its application as designed. However, the **five-year program window** and **two-year obligation requirement** create constraints that may force prioritization during implementation.

### SDOH/HRSN Component Survival

**Assessment: Survives as Embedded Component**

Kentucky's RHTP application **embeds social care throughout initiatives** rather than creating standalone SDOH programming. This design choice protects social care from explicit budget cuts but makes survival dependent on initiative-level implementation decisions.

**Screening requirements** will likely survive because they integrate with clinical workflows. Chronic care hubs, maternal health teams, and behavioral health services will screen for social needs as part of standard care processes. Screening identifies needs without guaranteeing intervention.

**Navigation services** survive through CHW deployment. Kentucky Homeplace CHWs already provide social service navigation; RHTP expansion continues this function. The critical question is whether navigation connects to resources that actually exist. Rural Kentucky has limited social services to navigate toward.

**Closed-loop referral** is not specified in Kentucky's application at the level of detail seen in states like Tennessee. Kentucky mentions existing platforms (**Kentucky 211, Unite Us, Findhelp**) without mandating statewide CIE deployment. This flexibility may result in fragmented referral systems rather than unified closed-loop infrastructure.

### CHW Program Survival

**Assessment: Strong Survival**

CHW deployment is **central to multiple initiatives** and benefits from Kentucky Homeplace's established track record. Estimated CHW funding of **$12-18 million** across initiatives supports expansion of an existing workforce rather than creating new programs.

**Training pipeline** is funded through chronic care hub and maternal health initiative allocations. Kentucky Homeplace can expand training capacity given demonstrated demand.

**Supervision infrastructure** exists through partnerships with FQHCs, health departments, and healthcare systems. CHWs require clinical supervision; Kentucky's employment model through established organizations provides supervision capacity.

**Medicaid reimbursement** enables post-RHTP sustainability. Healthcare systems can bill Medicaid for CHW services, creating revenue streams that persist after federal funding ends.

### CIE Platform Survival

**Assessment: Partial Survival**

Kentucky does not mandate a **single statewide CIE platform**. Existing systems (**Kentucky 211, Unite Us, Findhelp**) will continue operating; RHTP may support integration efforts without requiring unified adoption.

**Risk**: Without statewide platform mandate, referral systems may remain fragmented by region and health system. A patient in Hazard may use different referral infrastructure than a patient in Bowling Green. This fragmentation limits population-level coordination.

**Realistic outcome**: CIE platforms will operate in regions where health systems have adopted them. Statewide integration will not occur during RHTP's timeframe. Social care referral will depend on local implementation rather than unified infrastructure.

## The 2030 Question

### What Survives When Federal Funding Ends

**Telehealth infrastructure** persists because it generates fee-for-service revenue. Equipment, training, and network connections remain functional regardless of RHTP status. Specialty consultations continue through Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial reimbursement.

**CHW workforce** partially persists through Medicaid reimbursement. Healthcare systems with established CHW programs can sustain positions through billing. However, community-based CHW deployment without healthcare system employment may contract.

**EmPATH units** persist where hospital systems absorb operating costs. The UK HealthCare unit will likely continue; regional replications depend on local hospital financial sustainability.

**Hub-and-spoke coordination** faces sustainability challenges. Coordination functions often require dedicated staffing that revenue does not directly support. Hubs may survive as clinical service sites while coordination activities diminish.

**Training pipelines** face uncertain sustainability. Programs launched with RHTP funding may continue through institutional commitment or may contract when external support ends. KCTCS dental hygiene expansion depends on enrollment demand and state appropriations.

### Sustainability Mechanisms Built Into Plan

Kentucky's application includes **limited explicit sustainability planning**. The A3 Team structure focuses on implementation rather than transition. Governor Beshear's framing emphasized RHTP as helping "lessen the impacts" of Medicaid cuts rather than creating permanent infrastructure.

**Medicaid reimbursement** for CHWs represents the strongest sustainability mechanism. **Telehealth payment** provides another revenue pathway. Beyond these, sustainability depends on state budget decisions after 2030.

### State Commitment Beyond 2030

Kentucky's current administration has demonstrated commitment to rural health investment. Governor Beshear has been among the most vocal governors opposing Medicaid cuts and supporting RHTP implementation. However, **gubernatorial terms end** and political priorities shift. Kentucky's 2027 gubernatorial election will determine whether Beshear's successor maintains similar priorities.

The Kentucky General Assembly controls state appropriations. Rural health investments compete with other priorities. Post-RHTP sustainability through state funding is possible but not guaranteed.

## The Medicaid Math

### How Medicaid Cuts Interact with RHTP Investment

Kentucky faces the starkest Medicaid math of any expansion state. The Commonwealth expanded Medicaid in 2014, providing coverage to approximately **1.4 million Kentuckians** including 55% residing in rural areas. Medicaid is the **single largest payer** of healthcare in Kentucky, covering 50% of children and 70% of seniors in long-term care.

**Projected Medicaid cuts** from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act will extract approximately **$38 billion from Kentucky's Medicaid program over the next decade**, according to the Kentucky Center for Economic Policy. The Kentucky Hospital Association estimates hospital operating margins would fall from **2% to negative 7.4%** without state-directed payments that the legislation phases down.

**RHTP investment** totals approximately **$1.06 billion over five years** ($212.9M annually). This represents approximately **2.8% of projected Medicaid cuts** over the same period. RHTP cannot mathematically offset Medicaid erosion.

### Net Position of Rural Providers

**Appalachian Regional Healthcare** operates 14 hospitals across eastern Kentucky and southern West Virginia. ARH's CFO estimates the system faces a **$1 billion shortfall over the next decade** from Medicaid cuts. ARH employs 6,700 people with annual payroll and benefits of $474 million, making it the **largest employer in southeastern Kentucky**.

ARH has stated it has **"no immediate plans to close any hospitals"** and is **"not planning for any layoffs"** due to the legislation, citing system-wide financial strength. However, the statement acknowledges "increased uncertainty" and commits only to navigating challenges "with resilience." Standalone rural hospitals without system backing face greater vulnerability.

The **35 Kentucky rural hospitals** identified as at-risk by the Cecil G. Sheps Center include many facilities that are not part of large systems. Independent rural hospitals operating on thin margins face closure risk that RHTP investment cannot prevent if Medicaid revenues decline substantially.

### Whether Transformation Outpaces Erosion

**RHTP cannot outpace Medicaid erosion.** The arithmetic is clear: approximately $1 billion in transformation investment cannot offset $3.8 billion in annual Medicaid cuts by 2030. Rural Kentucky's healthcare infrastructure will be worse off in 2030 than 2025 if Medicaid cuts proceed as enacted.

**Transformation investment may preserve some components** that would otherwise collapse. EmPATH units, CHW networks, and telehealth infrastructure represent additions to healthcare capacity that did not exist before RHTP. These additions may persist even as baseline hospital and clinic capacity contracts.

**The realistic outcome** is transformation gains coexisting with system erosion: some new capabilities layered onto a weakened foundation. Rural Kentuckians may have better behavioral health crisis response and more CHW support while facing longer travel distances to hospitals that remain open.

## Stated Priorities Versus Actual Priorities

### What the Application Says Matters

Kentucky's RHTP application emphasizes **five interconnected innovation models** targeting the Commonwealth's most severe health disparities. The stated priority is comprehensive transformation addressing chronic disease, maternal health, behavioral health, oral health, and emergency services simultaneously.

### What Funding Allocations Reveal

Budget allocation reveals **behavioral health as highest priority** ($45-55M), followed by maternal health ($40-50M), chronic care ($35-45M), EMS ($30-40M), and dental ($25-35M). This prioritization aligns with documented crisis severity: behavioral health shortages strain emergency departments across the Commonwealth, and maternal mortality disparities have received national attention.

### Where Rhetoric Diverges from Resources

**Hospital stabilization** receives no direct RHTP allocation. Kentucky's 35 at-risk hospitals must survive on operational revenue while RHTP funds flow to transformation programming. The application acknowledges hospital vulnerability without directly addressing it.

**Workforce retention** appears throughout initiatives but lacks dedicated funding for salary support or loan repayment. Training pipelines expand workforce supply without addressing compensation gaps that drive rural outmigration.

**Transportation** is mentioned as a barrier but receives no dedicated programming. Patients must still travel to hubs, telehealth endpoints, and dental clinics. Transportation infrastructure remains unchanged.

### Social Care Rhetoric Versus Funded Reality

Kentucky's application includes SDOH language consistent with RHTP requirements but **does not prioritize social care as a distinct initiative**. Social care is embedded rather than featured. This approach protects social care from explicit cuts but also means social care lacks dedicated budget allocation, staffing, or performance metrics.

**The real theory of change** is clinical service expansion supported by CHW navigation. Social determinants are acknowledged barriers rather than direct intervention targets. Kentucky will screen for social needs more systematically while lacking resources to address many needs identified.

## Lessons for Other States

### What Kentucky's Approach Teaches

**Leveraging existing infrastructure accelerates implementation.** Kentucky Homeplace, UK HealthCare telehealth networks, and CMHC behavioral health systems provide foundations that new programs would lack. States with established rural health infrastructure can build on it rather than starting from scratch.

**Embedding social care protects it from triage.** By distributing SDOH components across initiatives rather than creating standalone social care programming, Kentucky makes social care difficult to cut without cutting clinical services. This integration strategy may preserve social care functions that explicit SDOH programs would lose.

**Honest framing manages expectations.** Governor Beshear's acknowledgment that RHTP will "lessen impacts" rather than solve problems sets realistic expectations. States that overpromise transformation risk backlash when results fall short.

### Transferable Elements

**EmPATH replication** offers a model for behavioral health crisis response that other states can adopt. The UK HealthCare implementation provides implementation guidance and outcome data.

**CHW expansion through established programs** demonstrates how existing workforce infrastructure can scale with federal investment. States with CHW certification and Medicaid reimbursement can follow similar pathways.

**A3 Team governance** provides a continuous improvement framework adaptable to other state structures. The Aspire-Activate-Attain cycle enables rapid learning and course correction.

### Context-Specific Elements

**Kentucky Homeplace's 30-year track record** cannot be replicated quickly. States without established CHW programs face longer development timelines.

**Medicaid expansion context** shapes Kentucky's baseline. Non-expansion states face different challenges and cannot assume similar coverage foundations.

**Appalachian Regional Healthcare's system presence** provides stability that standalone hospital markets lack. States without regional system anchors face greater fragmentation risk.

### What to Avoid

**Overpromising geographic coverage** when resources cannot support statewide implementation. Better to acknowledge prioritization than create expectations of universal reach.

**Assuming training produces retention.** Workforce pipelines may train individuals who leave for better opportunities elsewhere. Retention strategies must accompany training investments.

**Expecting technology to substitute for workforce.** Telehealth extends workforce reach but cannot replace absent providers. Technology investments must complement workforce development, not substitute for it.

## Conclusion

Kentucky's RHTP investment represents the **largest transformation effort in the state with the most vulnerable rural hospital system** in America. The Commonwealth brings unique assets: established CHW infrastructure through Kentucky Homeplace, emerging EmPATH crisis model with documented outcomes, academic medical center partnerships providing specialty capacity, and an administration committed to rural health priorities.

**What will succeed**: EmPATH replication will improve behavioral health crisis response in regional centers. CHW expansion will increase navigation capacity and chronic disease management support. Telehealth infrastructure will extend specialty access beyond academic medical centers. Maternal care teams will reduce travel burden for high-risk pregnancies in maternity deserts.

**What will struggle**: Dental and EMS workforce pipelines will expand slowly, with uncertain retention. Hub-and-spoke coordination will form networks without guaranteeing sustained collaboration. Technology integration will improve incrementally without achieving seamless interoperability.

**What will not change**: Kentucky will still have 35 rural hospitals at risk of closure. Medicaid cuts will still extract billions from the Commonwealth's healthcare system. Workforce shortages will persist in most specialties. Appalachian health disparities will remain among the worst in the nation.

**The honest assessment** is that RHTP enables meaningful improvement within structural constraints that RHTP cannot alter. Rural Kentucky will be better off with RHTP investment than without it. Rural Kentucky will still face crisis conditions that transformation programming cannot solve.

Governor Beshear's framing proves accurate: RHTP helps **"lessen the impacts"** of federal policy choices that harm rural Kentucky. Lessening impacts is not transformation. It is damage mitigation. Kentucky's RHTP investment is the best damage mitigation the Commonwealth could design given available resources and program constraints. It is not, and cannot be, the comprehensive solution that rural Kentucky requires.

The 35 hospitals at risk will need more than $114 per capita to survive. The 1.87 million rural Kentuckians facing Medicaid coverage losses will need more than CHW navigation to maintain healthcare access. The counties with life expectancy below 70 years will need more than hub-and-spoke networks to catch up with national averages. RHTP provides what it can within its statutory authority. What it cannot provide remains rural Kentucky's burden to bear.
