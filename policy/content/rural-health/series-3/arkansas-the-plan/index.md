Arkansas's RHTP application requests approximately **$1 billion over five years** to transform rural health through four interconnected initiatives: HEART, PACT, RISE, and THRIVE. The 126-page proposal, submitted October 31, 2025, by Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders and the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration, outlines a comprehensive strategy that emphasizes prevention, regional coordination, workforce development, and technology-enabled care delivery.

Part 1 established the paradox. Arkansas has the **highest rate of rural hospital vulnerability in the nation** at 50%, yet only one rural hospital has closed since Medicaid expansion in 2014. The RHTP funding arrives as the policy protection that preserved rural hospitals faces systematic erosion through federal Medicaid cuts. Arkansas is not using transformation funding to rebuild what has collapsed. Arkansas is using transformation funding to construct systems that might survive when current protections disappear.

The state received **$208.8 million for fiscal year 2026**, above the national average and ninth nationally in total allocation. Five-year funding depends on continued appropriations and compliance with program requirements, but Arkansas's application positions the state for approximately $200 million annually through 2031.

This analysis examines what Arkansas proposes to build, how the four initiatives connect, who implements the plan, and what assumptions must hold for the strategy to succeed.

## The Strategic Framework

Arkansas's RHTP plan is organized around four named initiatives, each with distinct focus areas but designed to function as integrated components of a comprehensive transformation strategy:

- **HEART (Healthy Eating, Active Recreation, and Transformation)**: Prevention and chronic disease management through community-based approaches
- **PACT (Promoting Access Coordination and Transformation)**: Care delivery integration, specialty access, and regional coordination through Clinically Integrated Networks
- **RISE (Recruitment Innovation Skills and Education for Arkansas)**: Workforce development, training expansion, and retention incentives
- **THRIVE (Telehealth Health Monitoring and Response Innovation for Vital Expansion)**: Technology infrastructure, telehealth platforms, remote monitoring, and EMS modernization

The **Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration (DFA)** serves as the lead implementing agency, with direct oversight from the governor's office. **Andy Babbitt**, currently state comptroller and DFA deputy director, serves as project director with an annual salary of $500,000 over the five-year program period. Administrative costs are budgeted at **$25 million for contracted services**, plus $2.5 million in personnel costs and $700,000 in fringe benefits.

This governance structure concentrates authority in the executive branch rather than distributing implementation across health-specific agencies like the Arkansas Department of Health or the Arkansas Medicaid program. The choice reflects Governor Sanders's desire to maintain direct control over RHTP priorities and implementation decisions. It also places accountability squarely with the governor's office, for better or worse.

The plan's **theory of change** rests on several propositions:

1. Prevention investment reduces future demand for acute services, easing pressure on vulnerable hospitals
2. Regional coordination through Clinically Integrated Networks enables resource sharing and care optimization
3. Workforce pipelines must be grown internally because external recruitment cannot meet needs
4. Technology enables care access in areas where physical infrastructure cannot be sustained
5. Transformation can create systems durable enough to survive beyond 2030 when RHTP funding ends

These propositions are plausible but unproven at scale. Arkansas is betting that five years of intensive investment can change trajectories that decades of prior policy failed to alter.

## Program Allocation Table

| Initiative | Focus Area | Budget Request | Lead Implementation | Key Deliverables |
|------------|------------|----------------|---------------------|------------------|
| HEART | Prevention, Nutrition, Chronic Disease | $150.5 million | DFA, Arkansas Department of Health | School-based clinics, mobile care units, nutrition programs, physical activity initiatives |
| PACT | Care Access, Specialty Integration, Regional Networks | $393 million | DFA, Regional CINs | Clinically Integrated Networks, specialty services, hospital partnerships, practice authority expansion |
| RISE | Workforce Development, Retention | $161.5 million | DFA, UAMS, Medical Schools | Residency expansion, scholarships, recruitment incentives, leadership training |
| THRIVE | Telehealth, Technology, EMS | $266.75 million | DFA, UAMS IDHI | Telehealth platforms, remote monitoring, EMS equipment, virtual specialty networks |
| Administration | Program Management | $28.2 million | DFA | Project director, contracted services, personnel, fringe |
| **Total** | | **~$1 billion** | | |

The budget allocations reveal Arkansas's priorities. **PACT commands the largest share at $393 million**, reflecting the state's emphasis on care delivery transformation and regional integration. **THRIVE receives $266.75 million**, acknowledging that technology infrastructure is foundational to other initiatives. **RISE at $161.5 million** addresses the workforce crisis that underlies all other challenges. **HEART's $150.5 million** positions prevention as essential but subordinate to care delivery and technology investments.

## Initiative 1: HEART

**Healthy Eating, Active Recreation, and Transformation**

**Budget**: $150.5 million over five years

HEART represents Arkansas's commitment to upstream intervention, addressing the chronic disease burden that drives healthcare utilization and costs. The initiative targets nutrition, physical activity, and chronic disease management through community-based programs rather than clinical services.

**Core Components**:

**School-Based Health Infrastructure**: $10 million funds school-based clinics and mobile care units that bring preventive services directly to students in rural communities. Arkansas has already implemented related policies, including Senate Bill 59 requiring free breakfast for all students, farm-to-school pilot programs promoting local food sourcing, and bell-to-bell cell phone bans intended to increase physical activity during school hours.

**Community-Driven Chronic Disease Management**: HEART integrates programs through schools, faith-based organizations, community centers, and healthcare facilities. The approach recognizes that chronic disease prevention requires lifestyle changes that occur outside clinical settings. Churches, which remain central institutions in rural Arkansas, become delivery points for health education and wellness programming.

**Nutrition Programs**: Arkansas became the first state to ban SNAP purchases of soft drinks and candy in 2025, a policy adopted explicitly to improve RHTP scoring under Make America Healthy Again priorities. HEART extends this emphasis through nutrition education, cooking classes, food access initiatives, and partnerships with local food producers.

**Physical Activity Initiatives**: The Natural State Initiative promotes outdoor recreation as a health intervention, leveraging Arkansas's extensive state parks and natural areas. HEART supports community fitness programs, walking paths, and recreational infrastructure in rural areas where commercial fitness facilities do not exist.

**Implementation Approach**: HEART programs flow through existing community institutions rather than creating new standalone organizations. Schools receive funding for clinics and programming. Churches and community centers host wellness activities. Local health departments coordinate rather than directly deliver services. This distributed model reduces administrative overhead but complicates accountability and quality assurance.

**Timeline**: School-based clinic deployment begins in year one, with full implementation of community programs by year three. Outcome measurement focuses on chronic disease prevalence, physical activity rates, and nutritional status among participating populations.

**What HEART Assumes**: The initiative assumes that prevention investment produces measurable results within the five-year funding window, that community institutions are willing and capable partners, and that behavior change is achievable through education and environmental modification. These assumptions are contested in the public health literature, where prevention programs often show modest effects and long time horizons for impact.

## Initiative 2: PACT

**Promoting Access Coordination and Transformation**

**Budget**: $393 million over five years (largest initiative)

PACT is the centerpiece of Arkansas's transformation strategy, addressing care delivery fragmentation through regional coordination and specialty service integration. The initiative's scale reflects Arkansas's judgment that access transformation, rather than prevention or workforce development, offers the highest return on investment.

**Budget Components**:
- $125 million: Specialty, preventive, and telehealth service expansion
- $125 million: Hospital acquisitions, partnerships, and facility upgrades
- $110 million: Clinically Integrated Network development
- $25 million: Expanding practice authority for healthcare professionals
- $8 million: Additional coordination and technical assistance

**Clinically Integrated Networks (CINs)**: The **$110 million CIN investment** represents Arkansas's structural bet on regional coordination. CINs are provider-led organizations that enable data sharing, care coordination, and resource alignment across hospitals, clinics, and specialty providers within defined geographic regions.

Arkansas envisions CINs as locally governed entities that preserve institutional autonomy while creating collective capacity. A rural hospital remains independently operated but gains access to shared data systems, coordinated specialty referrals, and joint purchasing power. A primary care clinic retains its identity but connects to hospital and specialist networks through standardized protocols and communication systems.

Arkansas's CIN model draws on successful examples from other states where regional networks have improved care coordination and reduced unnecessary utilization. The networks will operate as locally driven entities with state funding and technical support, allowing regional adaptation while maintaining statewide standards.

CIN functions include:
- Shared electronic health records and data exchange
- Care coordination across primary, specialty, and hospital settings
- Quality measurement and performance improvement
- Resource sharing for expensive equipment and personnel
- Joint contracting with payers where permissible
- Standardized clinical protocols for common conditions
- Population health management across network members

The challenge is that CINs require trust among providers who have historically competed for patients and resources. Rural hospitals in the same region may view each other as competitors rather than partners. Physicians may resist data sharing that exposes practice patterns to scrutiny. Administrators may fear losing autonomy to regional governance structures.

Building functional networks takes years of relationship development. Arkansas is attempting to accelerate this process with significant funding, but money alone does not create trust. The state will need skilled facilitators, governance frameworks that protect member interests, and early wins that demonstrate CIN value to skeptical participants.

**Specialty Service Integration**: The **$125 million for specialty, preventive, and telehealth services** addresses rural residents' difficulty accessing specialists. Rural hospitals cannot employ full-time specialists in cardiology, oncology, neurology, behavioral health, and other fields. PACT creates regional specialty networks where specialists rotate among facilities, provide telehealth consultations, and develop referral relationships with primary care providers.

Trauma-ready services receive specific attention. Many rural hospitals cannot meet trauma designation requirements, meaning injured patients must be transported to regional trauma centers that may be hours away. PACT funds training, equipment, and protocols to improve trauma response at rural facilities, even if full trauma designation remains unattainable.

**Hospital Acquisitions and Partnerships**: The **$125 million for hospital transactions and facility upgrades** enables strategic consolidation and investment. Some vulnerable hospitals may be acquired by larger systems that can provide management expertise and capital resources. Others may form partnerships that preserve local governance while accessing shared services.

Facility upgrades address physical plant deficiencies that limit service offerings. Aging buildings, outdated equipment, and inadequate technology prevent rural hospitals from providing services that patients need and that generate sustainable revenue. PACT investment enables modernization that improves both capability and financial viability.

**Practice Authority Expansion**: The **$25 million for expanding practice authority** signals Arkansas's intent to address scope of practice restrictions that limit advanced practice providers. Nurse practitioners and physician assistants in Arkansas cannot practice independently in many settings, requiring physician supervision even when physicians are unavailable.

This funding may support legislative advocacy, pilot programs demonstrating safe independent practice, and administrative changes within permissible limits. Arkansas faces organized opposition from physician groups, and $25 million in RHTP funding does not guarantee legislative success. The allocation represents strategic positioning rather than assured policy change.

**Key Subawardees and Partners**:
- **Arkansas Rural Health Partnership (ARHP)**: Nonprofit organization with 19 rural hospital members, 4 FQHCs, and 120+ affiliated clinics, positioned as lead intermediary for workforce and coordination programs
- **Arkansas Hospital Association (AHA)**: Statewide hospital association providing technical assistance and advocacy
- **Community Health Centers of Arkansas (CHCA)**: FQHC network supporting primary care access
- **Regional Health Systems**: Baptist Health, CHI St. Vincent, Mercy, and UAMS regional campuses serve as hub institutions for CIN development

## Initiative 3: RISE

**Recruitment Innovation Skills and Education for Arkansas**

**Budget**: $161.5 million over five years

RISE addresses the workforce crisis that underlies all other rural health challenges. Arkansas cannot transform care delivery without providers to deliver care. The state cannot sustain hospitals without staff to operate them. RISE invests in growing Arkansas's own workforce because recruiting from outside the state is insufficient.

**Budget Components**:
- $70.25 million: Residency programs and scholarships
- $67 million: Recruitment and retention incentives
- $16.3 million: Career advancement for nurses and other professionals
- $7.95 million: Leadership and governance training

**Residency Expansion**: Arkansas has limited graduate medical education capacity relative to its physician needs. RISE funds new residency slots in family medicine, internal medicine, psychiatry, and other specialties critical for rural practice. Research consistently shows that physicians who complete residency in a state are more likely to practice in that state long-term.

**University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS)** serves as the primary academic partner, operating the state's only medical school and managing extensive rural health programs. UAMS regional campuses in Northwest Arkansas, the Delta, and other areas provide training sites outside Little Rock.

Scholarship programs tied to service commitments attempt to build pipeline from medical school through residency to rural practice. Students who accept scholarships commit to practicing in underserved areas for specified periods after completing training. These programs have mixed track records nationally, with some recipients fulfilling commitments and others paying back scholarship funds to practice elsewhere.

**Recruitment and Retention Incentives**: The **$67 million for recruitment and retention** acknowledges that training providers is insufficient if they leave Arkansas after completing education. National workforce data shows that physicians who complete residency in a state are more likely to practice in that state, but "more likely" does not mean "certain." Many factors influence location decisions, including spouse employment, family proximity, lifestyle preferences, and professional opportunities.

Incentive programs include:
- Sign-on bonuses for providers accepting rural positions
- Loan repayment beyond federal programs
- Housing assistance in communities with limited housing stock
- Retention bonuses for providers who remain in rural practice
- Relocation support for providers and families

Retention receives equal emphasis to recruitment. Rural practice has high turnover because isolation, limited professional opportunities, and quality-of-life concerns drive providers to urban settings. Physicians in rural areas often lack colleagues for consultation, have limited access to continuing education, and face professional isolation that urban practitioners never experience. Spouses may struggle to find employment. Children may have limited educational opportunities. These factors drive attrition regardless of compensation.

RISE invests in preceptor development to improve training experiences, recognizing that trainees who have positive rural rotations are more likely to return for practice. Mentorship programs support early-career providers through challenging initial years when attrition risk is highest. Practice environment improvements, including technology, staffing, and facility upgrades, make rural positions more attractive relative to urban alternatives.

**Career Advancement for Nurses and Allied Health**: The **$16.3 million for career advancement** recognizes that workforce development extends beyond physicians. Nurses, medical assistants, lab technicians, radiology technicians, and other professionals staff rural facilities. Many rural workers want to advance their careers but lack access to education programs available in urban areas.

RISE supports "Earn While You Learn" programs that pay clinical staff to pursue additional credentials while continuing employment. A licensed practical nurse might earn a registered nursing degree. A medical assistant might complete nursing prerequisites. A registered nurse might advance to nurse practitioner. These programs retain workers who might otherwise leave for urban education opportunities and then not return.

**Leadership and Governance Training**: The **$7.95 million for leadership training** addresses a less visible but critical need. Rural hospital boards often include community members with limited healthcare expertise. Hospital administrators may have operational skills but lack strategic vision for healthcare transformation. RISE prepares leaders and board members for decisions required during transformation.

**Key Partners**:
- **UAMS**: Medical school, nursing programs, allied health training, residency programs
- **Arkansas Colleges of Health Education**: Osteopathic medical education
- **Arkansas State University**: Nursing and health professions programs
- **Arkansas Rural Health Partnership**: Workforce pipeline programs, mobile health workforce unit

## Initiative 4: THRIVE

**Telehealth Health Monitoring and Response Innovation for Vital Expansion**

**Budget**: $266.75 million over five years

THRIVE builds the technology infrastructure that enables other initiatives to function. Telehealth cannot operate without broadband connectivity and interoperable systems. Care coordination fails without data exchange. Remote monitoring requires devices, platforms, and integration with clinical workflows. THRIVE invests in the digital backbone that Arkansas's rural health transformation requires.

**Budget Components**:
- $105 million: Medical and EMS equipment upgrades
- $91.75 million: Remote patient monitoring launch
- $60 million: Telehealth expansion
- $10 million: Virtual specialty care networks

**EMS Equipment and Modernization**: The **$105 million for equipment** addresses aging infrastructure across rural emergency medical services and hospitals. Many rural EMS agencies operate outdated ambulances with limited equipment. Cardiac monitors, defibrillators, ventilators, and communication systems require modernization to enable effective emergency response and transport.

Hospital equipment investments support diagnostic capabilities that keep patients in rural facilities rather than requiring transfer. CT scanners, ultrasound machines, and laboratory equipment that can provide rapid results enable rural hospitals to diagnose and treat conditions that would otherwise require transfer to regional centers.

**Remote Patient Monitoring**: The **$91.75 million for remote monitoring** enables chronic disease management outside clinical settings. Patients with diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, and other conditions use connected devices to track vital signs and transmit data to care teams. Nurses and care coordinators monitor dashboards and intervene when readings indicate problems.

Remote monitoring reduces emergency department visits and hospitalizations by catching deterioration early. A patient with heart failure whose weight increases rapidly, indicating fluid retention, can receive medication adjustment before symptoms escalate to emergency levels. A patient with diabetes whose blood glucose readings trend upward can receive dietary counseling before hyperglycemia becomes crisis.

The approach also extends the reach of limited clinical staff, allowing one nurse to monitor dozens of patients rather than seeing them individually in clinic visits. This efficiency is essential in Arkansas, where nursing shortages limit the care that can be delivered through traditional face-to-face encounters.

Remote monitoring programs require more than devices. They require integration with clinical workflows, protocols for responding to alerts, staffing models that accommodate monitoring responsibilities, and patient education that ensures proper device use. Failed remote monitoring programs often deploy technology without addressing these operational requirements. Arkansas's THRIVE investment must fund implementation support alongside equipment procurement.

Arkansas's remote monitoring investment leverages existing infrastructure through **UAMS e-Link**, one of the nation's largest telehealth networks with over 25 years of experience and connections to more than 400 healthcare and education sites across Arkansas. The **UAMS Institute for Digital Health and Innovation (IDHI)** provides training, technical support, and program development for organizations implementing telehealth. These established resources provide foundation for RHTP expansion rather than starting from scratch.

**Telehealth Expansion**: The **$60 million for telehealth** extends virtual care capabilities beyond current reach. UAMS already operates extensive telehealth programs including:
- **ANGELS (Antenatal & Neonatal Guidelines, Education and Learning System)**: High-risk pregnancy support connecting rural providers with maternal-fetal medicine specialists
- **Stroke Program**: Telestroke services enabling rapid diagnosis and treatment decisions for stroke patients at rural facilities
- **Psychiatry**: Telepsychiatry services addressing severe behavioral health shortages in rural areas
- **Specialty consultations**: Various specialty services accessible through video consultation

THRIVE funding expands these programs to additional sites and populations while developing new service lines based on community needs assessment.

The expansion includes patient-facing telehealth for routine care, enabling rural residents to access primary care and behavioral health services from home. This reduces travel burden and increases access for patients who cannot take time off work or find transportation for clinic visits.

**Virtual Specialty Care Networks**: The **$10 million for virtual specialty networks** complements PACT's physical specialty service integration. Virtual networks connect primary care providers with specialists for real-time consultations, enabling rural providers to manage complex conditions with specialist guidance rather than referring patients to distant centers.

The networks use the eConsult model, where specialists review patient information and provide recommendations without direct patient encounters. This approach improves care quality while preserving the primary care relationship and keeping patients in their communities.

**Artificial Intelligence Integration**: THRIVE's technology investment includes **patient-centered artificial intelligence** for coordinating records across delivery systems. AI applications support care coordination by identifying high-risk patients, predicting deterioration, and recommending interventions. Arkansas frames AI as a tool for efficiency rather than replacement for clinical judgment.

**Key Infrastructure Partners**:
- **UAMS e-Link**: Statewide telehealth network
- **UAMS Institute for Digital Health and Innovation**: Training, research, technical support
- **Arkansas Rural Connect**: State broadband initiative providing rural connectivity infrastructure

## Social Care Integration

Arkansas's RHTP application emphasizes community-based approaches through HEART but does not prominently feature the social care infrastructure that other states have prioritized. The plan's social care elements are embedded within broader initiatives rather than constituting dedicated programs.

### Social Care Integration Table

| Component | Included in Plan | Funding | Vendor/Operator | Likely Funded? |
|-----------|------------------|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| SDOH/HRSN Screening | Embedded in HEART | Not specified | Provider-level implementation | At Risk |
| Community Health Workers | Embedded in workforce | Not specified | ARCHWA, ARHP | At Risk |
| CIE Platform | Not explicitly included | Not specified | None identified | Unknown |
| Social Needs Navigation | Embedded in care coordination | Within CIN budgets | Regional CINs | At Risk |

**SDOH Screening**: The application does not mandate standardized social determinants of health screening across participating providers. Individual CINs and hospital systems may implement screening as part of care coordination, but no statewide protocol or funding allocation specifically targets screening implementation.

**Community Health Workers**: Arkansas has an established CHW workforce supported by the **Arkansas Community Health Worker Association (ARCHWA)**, which has operated since 2013 and hosts annual summits for CHW professional development. The **Arkansas Rural Health Partnership** employs CHWs and operates workforce pipeline programs. However, the RHTP application does not specify CHW deployment targets, training allocations, or employment infrastructure development. CHW programs may survive within general workforce budgets but are not protected as priority investments.

**Community Information Exchange**: Arkansas does not identify a statewide CIE platform or request funding for closed-loop referral systems like Unite Us or Findhelp. The state has 211 services through United Way, but integration with clinical care systems is not addressed in the RHTP application. This represents a gap compared to states that have made CIE platforms central to their transformation strategies.

**Social Care Assessment**: Arkansas's approach embeds social care within community-based initiatives and general care coordination rather than building dedicated infrastructure. This approach may prove adequate if CINs and community partners organically develop social care capabilities. It may prove inadequate if social care integration requires dedicated funding, technology platforms, and workforce investments that the current plan does not provide.

The risk is that social care components get deprioritized when funding constraints force triage decisions. Programs without dedicated line items are easier to reduce or eliminate than those with protected budgets.

## Budget Flow and Timeline

Arkansas's $1 billion request assumes approximately equal annual funding of $200 million from FY2026 through FY2031. The state received $208.8 million in the first year, slightly above this assumption. Future allocations depend on continued appropriations and state compliance with program requirements.

**Year 1 (FY2026)**: Infrastructure establishment, CIN formation, initial program launches
- Deploy school-based clinics under HEART
- Establish governance structures for regional CINs
- Begin residency expansion planning
- Launch telehealth infrastructure procurement

**Year 2 (FY2027)**: Program expansion, network development
- Expand HEART programs to additional communities
- Activate CIN data sharing and care coordination
- Recruit initial cohorts under RISE incentive programs
- Deploy remote monitoring systems

**Year 3 (FY2028)**: Full implementation, performance measurement
- Complete community program implementation
- Establish specialty service networks through PACT
- Graduate first expanded residency cohorts
- Achieve statewide telehealth coverage

**Years 4-5 (FY2029-2031)**: Optimization, sustainability planning
- Refine programs based on outcome data
- Develop post-RHTP funding mechanisms
- Transition successful programs to sustainable financing
- Document and disseminate lessons learned

**Two-Year Obligation Requirement**: Federal rules require states to obligate RHTP funds within two years of receipt. This creates pressure for rapid spending that may conflict with careful implementation. Arkansas must balance speed of deployment against quality of program design.

**Administrative Costs**: The $28.2 million administrative allocation (2.8% of total budget) is modest compared to some state plans. This may reflect confidence in existing state capacity or may create strain as implementation demands exceed administrative resources.

## Subawardee Registry

Arkansas's RHTP application identifies key organizations expected to receive funds or serve as implementation partners. Contract values are estimates based on application narratives and comparable programs:

| Organization | Type | Estimated Contract | Role in RHTP Implementation |
|--------------|------|-------------------|----------------------------|
| UAMS Institute for Digital Health and Innovation | Academic Partner | $80-100 million | Telehealth hub, e-Link network expansion, remote monitoring, training |
| Arkansas Rural Health Partnership | Intermediary | $40-60 million | Rural hospital coordination, workforce pipeline, Delta network |
| Arkansas Hospital Association | Intermediary | $15-25 million | Technical assistance, CIN development support, policy advocacy |
| Community Health Centers of Arkansas | Provider Network | $20-30 million | FQHC coordination, primary care access, workforce training sites |
| UAMS Regional Campuses | Academic Partner | $30-50 million | Residency expansion, clinical training, specialty consultations |
| Arkansas Department of Health | State Agency | $25-35 million | HEART program coordination, school health, chronic disease surveillance |
| Regional Health Systems (Baptist, CHI St. Vincent, Mercy) | Provider Hubs | $50-75 million | CIN anchor institutions, specialty services, hospital partnerships |
| Arkansas Community Health Worker Association | Workforce Partner | $5-10 million | CHW training, certification, professional development |
| Local School Districts | Community Partners | $8-12 million | School-based clinic hosting, nutrition programs, student health |
| Faith-Based Organizations | Community Partners | $5-10 million | Wellness programming, community health education, outreach |

**Note**: Arkansas's application does not identify specific CIE platform vendors. No contracts for Unite Us, Findhelp, or similar social care referral platforms appear in available documentation.

## Funding Flow Documentation

Arkansas structures RHTP funding flow through centralized state control with delegated implementation:

**Level 1: Federal to State**
CMS awards funds directly to the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration based on approved application. FY2026 award: $208,779,396. Annual allocations expected through FY2031.

**Level 2: State Administrative Layer**
DFA retains administrative control with $28.2 million for program management. Project Director Andy Babbitt oversees implementation. DFA contracts with intermediaries and passes through funds to providers.

**Level 3: Intermediary Distribution**
- **Arkansas Rural Health Partnership** administers workforce and rural hospital coordination funds
- **Arkansas Hospital Association** provides technical assistance and CIN development support
- **UAMS** manages telehealth, training, and academic program expansion
- **Arkansas Department of Health** coordinates prevention and school health programs

**Level 4: Provider and Community Recipients**
- Rural hospitals receive direct awards for facility upgrades and CIN participation
- Primary care practices receive incentives for care coordination and telehealth adoption
- Community organizations receive grants for prevention programming and outreach

**Fund Distribution Timeline**:
- Q1 FY2026: Administrative infrastructure, contract execution
- Q2 FY2026: Initial provider awards, equipment procurement
- Q3-Q4 FY2026: Program launch, service delivery begins
- FY2027 onward: Sustained operations, performance-based adjustments

**Performance-Based Elements**: Arkansas incorporates quality metrics into CIN funding, with allocations tied to care coordination outcomes, utilization patterns, and population health measures. Workforce retention incentives include multi-year commitments with clawback provisions for early departure.

## Cross-Initiative Coordination

Arkansas designs its four initiatives to function as interconnected components rather than parallel programs:

**HEART and PACT Integration**: Prevention programs under HEART connect to care delivery through PACT's Clinically Integrated Networks. School-based clinics established under HEART refer students to CIN member providers for follow-up care. Chronic disease management initiated in community settings continues through CIN care coordination. The connection ensures that prevention investment leads to treatment access rather than identifying problems without solutions.

**PACT and THRIVE Integration**: Care access improvements under PACT depend on technology infrastructure from THRIVE. CINs require data sharing platforms that THRIVE funds. Specialty consultations arranged through PACT occur via telehealth systems THRIVE deploys. Remote monitoring launched under THRIVE feeds into care coordination managed by CIN care teams. The integration is essential because neither initiative succeeds without the other.

**RISE and All Initiatives**: Workforce development under RISE enables everything else. HEART's school-based clinics need staff. PACT's specialty networks need physicians. THRIVE's remote monitoring needs nurses to review data and intervene. RISE training programs prepare workers for transformed care delivery rather than traditional practice patterns. Residency curricula emphasize telehealth, team-based care, and population health management.

**Shared Infrastructure**:
- UAMS e-Link network serves as common telehealth platform across initiatives
- Regional CINs coordinate both clinical services (PACT) and prevention referrals (HEART)
- Arkansas Rural Health Partnership connects workforce programs (RISE) with rural hospital needs (PACT)
- Mobile health units serve both prevention screening (HEART) and primary care access (PACT)

**Sequencing Dependencies**:
- THRIVE infrastructure deployment must precede PACT telehealth services
- RISE workforce expansion must keep pace with PACT service capacity growth
- CIN formation under PACT must occur before network-level prevention programs under HEART
- Technology training under RISE must match THRIVE deployment timeline

**Integration Risks**: Cross-initiative coordination requires alignment across multiple agencies, intermediaries, and provider organizations. Delays in one initiative ripple to others. If THRIVE telehealth deployment lags, PACT specialty access suffers. If RISE training falls behind, PACT and THRIVE lack workforce to operate new systems. Arkansas's centralized governance through DFA may facilitate coordination or may create bottlenecks if decision-making capacity is insufficient.

## Stakeholder Architecture

Arkansas assembles a stakeholder ecosystem with defined roles and accountability structures:

**Lead Agency: Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration**
- Overall program accountability to CMS
- Contract administration and fund distribution
- Performance monitoring and reporting
- Policy coordination with governor's office

**Academic Partners**
- **UAMS**: Primary academic partner for telehealth, training, research, and specialty services
- **UAMS Regional Campuses**: Northwest Arkansas, Delta, and other locations provide distributed training and service delivery
- **Arkansas Colleges of Health Education**: Osteopathic medical education adds physician pipeline capacity
- **Arkansas State University**: Nursing and allied health programs support workforce expansion

**Intermediary Organizations**
- **Arkansas Rural Health Partnership**: 19 rural hospital members plus FQHCs and clinics; coordinates network development and workforce programs
- **Arkansas Hospital Association**: Statewide hospital advocacy and technical assistance
- **Community Health Centers of Arkansas**: FQHC network coordination and primary care access
- **Arkansas Community Health Worker Association**: CHW training, certification, and professional development

**Provider Organizations**
- **Rural Hospitals**: 47 rural hospitals with inpatient services participate in CINs and receive facility support
- **Critical Access Hospitals**: 5 CAHs receive targeted support for service transformation
- **Rural Emergency Hospitals**: 5 REHs integrate into regional networks
- **FQHCs**: 163 sites provide primary care infrastructure
- **Rural Health Clinics**: 149 RHCs expand access network

**Regional Health Systems**
- **Baptist Health**: Central and eastern Arkansas presence
- **CHI St. Vincent**: Central Arkansas and statewide network
- **Mercy**: Northwest Arkansas regional system
- **UAMS Health**: Academic health system with statewide reach

**Community Organizations**
- Local school districts host school-based clinics
- Faith-based organizations deliver community wellness programming
- Local health departments coordinate prevention activities
- Community foundations provide matching support in some regions

**Payer Relationships**: Arkansas's RHTP plan has limited payer involvement. ARHOME (Arkansas Medicaid expansion) operates separately from RHTP implementation, though beneficiaries overlap. Commercial insurers are not identified as RHTP partners. This reflects RHTP's statutory structure as direct CMS-to-state funding that bypasses managed care.

## What the Plan Assumes

Arkansas's RHTP strategy rests on assumptions that may or may not prove accurate:

**Prevention produces measurable results within five years.** HEART invests $150.5 million in nutrition, physical activity, and chronic disease prevention. Chronic disease trajectories develop over decades. Five years is a short window to demonstrate population-level health improvement. The assumption may prove optimistic.

**Clinically Integrated Networks can be built quickly.** PACT allocates $110 million to CIN development, expecting functional regional networks within two to three years. CINs in other states required longer gestation periods to build trust and operational capacity. Arkansas is attempting accelerated development with significant funding, but provider relationships may not respond to financial incentives alone.

**Workforce pipelines produce retention, not just training.** RISE invests in residency expansion, scholarships, and incentives, assuming that trained providers will remain in Arkansas. National data shows mixed results for retention programs. Arkansas may succeed in training providers who then leave for urban positions elsewhere.

**Technology infrastructure enables transformation rather than becoming an end in itself.** THRIVE invests $266.75 million in telehealth, remote monitoring, and digital infrastructure. Technology investments can produce impressive capabilities that remain underutilized if workflow integration fails or provider adoption lags. The assumption is that Arkansas will achieve both deployment and adoption.

**Medicaid cuts do not overwhelm transformation gains.** Arkansas's plan proceeds against a backdrop of federal Medicaid reductions that will reduce rural hospital revenue beginning in 2029. The plan does not explicitly model the interaction between transformation investment and Medicaid erosion. The implicit assumption is that transformation produces efficiency gains and revenue diversification sufficient to offset Medicaid losses. This assumption may be tested severely.

**State and local partners maintain commitment through five years.** Implementation depends on community organizations, regional health systems, academic institutions, and local governments sustaining engagement through the full program period. Political changes, leadership turnover, and competing priorities may erode partner commitment before transformation is complete.

**Post-2030 funding materializes.** The plan aims to create sustainable systems, but sustainability requires revenue sources beyond RHTP. Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, commercial insurance, state appropriations, and local support must collectively sustain what RHTP builds. If these sources prove insufficient, transformation investments become stranded costs.

## Conclusion

Arkansas proposes to invest approximately $1 billion over five years in a four-initiative transformation strategy that emphasizes prevention (HEART), care delivery integration (PACT), workforce development (RISE), and technology infrastructure (THRIVE). The plan is comprehensive, well-structured, and responsive to Arkansas's specific rural health challenges.

PACT's $393 million investment in Clinically Integrated Networks represents the strategic centerpiece, betting that regional coordination can achieve efficiencies and improvements that fragmented systems cannot. THRIVE's $266.75 million technology investment builds infrastructure that enables other initiatives to function. RISE's $161.5 million addresses the workforce crisis that limits everything else. HEART's $150.5 million positions prevention as foundational but secondary to care delivery transformation.

The governance structure concentrates authority in the governor's office and Department of Finance and Administration, with direct project management rather than delegation to health-specific agencies. This approach enables coordinated implementation but creates accountability risks if political leadership changes or administrative capacity proves insufficient.

Social care integration is embedded within initiatives rather than established as dedicated infrastructure. Arkansas does not propose statewide SDOH screening mandates, CHW deployment targets, or CIE platform procurement. This approach may prove adequate if community-based programs organically develop social care capabilities. It may prove inadequate if social care requires protected funding and dedicated infrastructure that the current plan does not provide.

The plan's assumptions are plausible but unproven. Prevention must produce results within five years. CINs must form quickly despite historical barriers. Workforce investments must produce retention, not just training. Technology must achieve adoption, not just deployment. Transformation gains must outpace Medicaid erosion. Partners must sustain commitment. Funding must continue or alternatives must emerge.

Part 3 of this analysis assesses what works, what struggles, what gets cut when funding constraints bite, and whether Arkansas's strategic bet can possibly succeed in the context of systematic Medicaid reduction.
