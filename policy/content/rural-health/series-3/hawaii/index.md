Hawaii presents a paradox in rural health policy. The state is **perceived as compact and urbanized**, yet **95.1% of its land area qualifies as rural** under federal definitions. Healthcare services cluster on Oahu, leaving residents of Hawaii Island, Maui, Kauai, Molokai, and Lanai separated from specialty care by ocean channels rather than mountain passes. The barriers to access are not distance measured in miles but **distance measured in flight times and airfares**.

On December 29, 2025, CMS awarded Hawaii **$188,892,440** through the Rural Health Transformation Program, the first installment of an anticipated five-year commitment. Despite scoring among the lowest states on data-driven factors like total rural population and geographic size, Hawaii secured funding that translates to **one of the highest per-capita investments in the nation**. This outcome reflects the strength of the state's application rather than the scale of its rural population.

The central challenge Hawaii confronts is **structural fragmentation**. Rural hospitals operate on separate islands without the ability to share staff, equipment, or patients through ground transport. Workforce shortages that plague rural America become existential threats when a single physician's departure can eliminate specialty access for an entire island. Emergency care depends on air ambulances costing $15,000 to $50,000 per transport, with insurance coverage inconsistent at best.

Hawaii's RHTP strategy bets on **technology as the bridge** across these geographic divides. Digital infrastructure, telehealth expansion, and interoperable health records form the backbone of a plan designed to make physical separation less determinative of health outcomes.

## Rural Health Landscape

Hawaii's healthcare infrastructure reflects the fundamental geography of an archipelago. The state operates **29 hospitals** with approximately 2,600 licensed beds, but roughly **70% of staffed beds concentrate on Oahu**. For the 31% of Hawaii's population living on the neighbor islands, this concentration creates a structural access deficit that no amount of local optimization can fully resolve.

**Critical Access Hospitals** anchor rural healthcare delivery across the neighbor islands:

| Facility | Location | Island | Beds |
|----------|----------|--------|------|
| Ka'u Hospital | Pahala | Hawaii | 21 |
| Kohala Hospital | Kapaau | Hawaii | 25 |
| Hale Ho'ola Hamakua | Honokaa | Hawaii | 25 |
| Kauai Veterans Memorial Hospital | Waimea | Kauai | 45 |
| Samuel Mahelona Memorial Hospital | Kapaa | Kauai | 80 |
| Molokai General Hospital | Kaunakakai | Molokai | 15 |
| Lanai Community Hospital | Lanai City | Lanai | 14 |
| North Hawaii Community Hospital | Kamuela | Hawaii | 39 |
| Kahuku Medical Center | Kahuku | Oahu | 21 |

The **Hawaii Health Systems Corporation** operates eight of these facilities through four regional divisions: East Hawaii, West Hawaii, Kauai, and Oahu. HHSC functions as the state's **safety net system**, required to serve all patients regardless of insurance status or ability to pay. This mission generates structural deficits that require annual state legislative appropriations, a dependency that creates persistent uncertainty about facility viability.

Beyond hospitals, Hawaii's primary care infrastructure includes **15 Federally Qualified Health Centers**, **15 Rural Health Clinics**, and a distinctive network of **five Native Hawaiian Health Care Systems** coordinated by Papa Ola Lokahi. These Native Hawaiian systems blend Western medicine with traditional healing practices, serving as both clinical providers and cultural institutions. The Waianae Coast Comprehensive Health Center, Hui No Ke Ola Pono on Maui, Ho'ola Lahui Hawaii on Kauai, Hui Malama Ola Na 'Oiwi on Hawaii Island, and Na Pu'uwai on Molokai together reach Native Hawaiian communities that often experience the state's most severe health disparities.

**Workforce shortages** define the operational reality for rural providers. The 2025 Hawaii Physician Workforce Assessment Project documented a statewide shortage of **833 full-time equivalent physicians** when geographic requirements are factored in. Hawaii County faces a **43% physician gap**, requiring 224 additional doctors to meet demand. Maui County follows at **41%**, needing 179 more physicians. Primary care accounts for the deepest shortages, with close to 180 full-time primary care physicians needed statewide.

The workforce crisis extends beyond aggregate numbers. In 2025, at least 81 physicians retired, 14 died, and more than 88 relocated to the mainland. Hawaii's **aging physician population**, with 24% over age 65, signals accelerating attrition in coming years. Cost of living, housing prices, and lower compensation compared to continental positions create a structural disadvantage in recruitment. The University of Hawaii John A. Burns School of Medicine produces approximately 75 graduates annually, but many complete residencies on the mainland and do not return for a decade or longer.

## RHTP Award and Context

Hawaii's **$188,892,440 FY2026 award** represents the first year of an anticipated five-year commitment. If future allocations track the initial award, the state could receive approximately **$944 million through 2030**. CMS required all states to submit initial requests of $1 billion with $200 million annual budgets. Hawaii's actual award exceeded preliminary estimates that projected roughly $150 million based on the state's lower data-driven scoring factors.

**Per-capita analysis** reveals Hawaii's favorable position within RHTP's allocation framework:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| FY2026 Award | $188,892,440 |
| State Population | 1,446,146 |
| Rural Population (40.8%) | ~590,000 |
| Per Rural Resident | ~$320 |
| Per State Resident | ~$131 |
| National Average per Rural Resident | ~$167 |

Hawaii's **$320 per rural resident** places it among the highest per-capita recipients nationally, nearly double the average. This favorable position results from the program's equal distribution component, where 50% of funds divide equally among all 50 states regardless of population. Small-population states benefit disproportionately from this structure.

**Medicaid expansion status** provides Hawaii with a strategic advantage that non-expansion states lack. Hawaii implemented its QUEST program in 1994, predating the Affordable Care Act by two decades. The state's current QUEST Integration program covers adults up to 138% of the federal poverty level, children to 313% FPL, and provides comprehensive managed care benefits through contracted health plans. Approximately **406,000 residents** receive Medicaid coverage, representing roughly 28% of the state population.

This broad coverage base means Hawaii's rural providers face less uncompensated care burden than counterparts in non-expansion states. However, the projected **Medicaid cuts embedded in federal reconciliation legislation** create exposure that RHTP cannot offset. The program explicitly prohibits using funds to supplant existing clinical service reimbursements, meaning transformation dollars cannot backfill reduced Medicaid payments.

## State Approach

Hawaii's RHTP strategy reflects **strong gubernatorial engagement** in both program design and application development. Governor Josh Green, himself an emergency physician who practiced at Kohala Hospital on Hawaii Island, worked directly with HHS and CMS leadership to shape RHTP's national structure. This involvement ensured the program accommodated states with geographically dispersed rural populations, not just those with contiguous rural territories.

The **Governor's Office** serves as lead agency, coordinating implementation across the Department of Health, Department of Human Services (Med-QUEST Division), University of Hawaii, and community partners. Federal rules cap administrative costs at 10% of the award, directing the remaining $170 million toward program implementation.

Hawaii's application centered on **six interconnected initiatives** designed to address the specific constraints of archipelago healthcare:

**1. Rural Health Information Network (RHIN)** creates a statewide digital backbone connecting rural hospitals, clinics, and health centers through interoperable electronic health records, secure wireless networks, and shared data platforms. The initiative addresses the current fragmentation where facilities on different islands cannot readily exchange patient information.

**2. Pili Ola Telehealth Network** expands virtual care access by deploying telehealth endpoints in schools, libraries, workplaces, and community centers across rural Hawaii. The initiative includes telehealth navigator positions to help patients access services and remote patient monitoring capabilities for chronic disease management.

**3. Rural Infrastructure for Care Access (RICA)** targets physical access barriers through expansion of emergency medical services, mobile healthcare units, community paramedicine programs, and behavioral health capacity. A statewide emergency and trauma coordination center will provide real-time system visibility across all islands.

**4. HOME RUN** (Hawaii Outreach for Medical Education in Rural Under-resourced Neighborhoods) establishes a workforce pipeline encompassing rural training sites, residency programs, nursing transition-to-practice programs, high school healthcare certificates, scholarships, and retention incentives.

**5. Rural Respite Network** creates five medical respite centers on Kauai, Maui, Kona, Hilo, and Waianae to reduce preventable hospitalizations among homeless patients and those with post-acute medical needs. This initiative extends Governor Green's kauhale village concept to neighbor islands.

**6. Value-Based Care Accelerator** provides competitive funding to help rural providers adopt population health models and value-based payment arrangements, preparing Hawaii for CMS's AHEAD payment system.

## Program and Funding Distribution

State officials indicated final budget allocations by initiative remain subject to CMS negotiation, but the overall framework reflects technology and workforce as dominant investment categories.

| Program | Focus Area | Lead Organization | Key Deliverables |
|---------|------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Rural Health Information Network | Technology/Infrastructure | Department of Health | Interoperable EHR connectivity, wireless networks, shared data hubs |
| Pili Ola Telehealth Network | Technology/Access | Department of Health | Telehealth access points, navigator positions, remote patient monitoring |
| Rural Infrastructure for Care Access | Infrastructure/Access | Department of Health (EMS) | EMS expansion, mobile health units, community paramedicine, trauma coordination |
| HOME RUN Workforce Pipeline | Workforce | University of Hawaii | Rural training sites, residencies, scholarships, mentoring programs |
| Rural Respite Network | Social Care/Infrastructure | Department of Human Services | Five medical respite centers across neighbor islands |
| Value-Based Care Accelerator | Payment Transformation | Governor's Office | Competitive grants for population health adoption |

**Key subawardees** and implementing partners span public and private sectors:

**Hawaii Health Systems Corporation** will participate in RHIN implementation across its eight facilities, potentially standardizing EHR systems that currently vary by region. The West Hawaii Region already operates EPIC through partnership with Queens Health Systems.

**University of Hawaii John A. Burns School of Medicine** anchors HOME RUN workforce development, building on existing programs like the Kauai Medical Training Track that provides rural exposure throughout medical education.

**Hawaii Primary Care Association** coordinates FQHC participation in telehealth expansion and interoperability initiatives.

**Papa Ola Lokahi** and the five Native Hawaiian Health Care Systems integrate traditional healing approaches with RHTP-funded digital infrastructure.

## Social Care Integration

| Component | Included in Plan | Funding | Vendor/Operator | Likely Funded? |
|-----------|------------------|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| SDOH/HRSN | Embedded in multiple initiatives | Not separately itemized | State agencies, FQHCs | Yes (limited scope) |
| CHW Programs | Yes (within RICA and workforce) | Not separately itemized | Community health centers, Native Hawaiian systems | At Risk |
| CIE Platform | Yes (within RHIN) | Not separately itemized | TBD via procurement | At Risk |
| Medical Respite | Yes (Rural Respite Network) | Significant allocation | Department of Human Services | Yes |

Hawaii's RHTP application addresses social determinants through **embedded approaches** rather than standalone SDOH initiatives. The Rural Respite Network directly targets housing instability's intersection with healthcare, providing post-acute recovery space for homeless individuals who would otherwise cycle through emergency departments.

The **Pili Ola Telehealth Network** includes telehealth navigators who function similarly to community health workers, helping patients access services and connecting them to community resources. However, explicit CHW deployment as a scaled workforce strategy receives less emphasis than technology-mediated solutions.

**Community Information Exchange** capabilities fold into the Rural Health Information Network's broader interoperability goals. The state has not identified a specific CIE platform or vendor, suggesting procurement decisions remain pending. Hawaii's existing 211 system and various community resource databases could potentially integrate with RHIN infrastructure.

The **QUEST Integration** Medicaid program already incorporates some HRSN services through its 1115 waiver authority, including housing supports and community integration services for homeless populations. RHTP investments complement rather than duplicate these Medicaid-funded activities.

## Assessment

**Strengths**

Hawaii's RHTP strategy benefits from **gubernatorial priority and engagement** that few states can match. Governor Green's direct involvement with federal officials during program development, combined with his clinical experience in rural emergency medicine, creates alignment between political leadership and operational reality.

The **technology-centered approach** reflects appropriate recognition of geography's constraints. When providers cannot share staff or patients across islands, they can potentially share information, expertise, and virtual consultations. Digital infrastructure investments address a genuine barrier rather than pursuing innovation for its own sake.

**Medicaid expansion** provides a coverage foundation that reduces the uncompensated care burden on rural facilities. QUEST Integration's managed care structure creates relationships with health plans that could support sustainability planning beyond 2030.

The **Native Hawaiian Health Care System** infrastructure offers culturally aligned entry points for populations experiencing significant health disparities. Integration of traditional healing practices with RHTP-funded digital systems could strengthen engagement with communities historically underserved by Western medical models.

**Vulnerabilities**

Hawaii's small rural population, while generating favorable per-capita funding, also limits the **scale of any given initiative**. $944 million over five years sounds substantial, but distributed across six initiatives, four counties, eight HHSC facilities, 15 FQHCs, and multiple workforce programs, individual allocations may prove insufficient to achieve transformational impact.

**Workforce shortages of 833 physicians** cannot be resolved through RHTP alone. The HOME RUN initiative creates pipeline infrastructure, but pipeline programs require decades to produce practicing physicians. The immediate crisis of retiring doctors and departing specialists will continue regardless of training investments.

The **Hawaii Health Systems Corporation's financial fragility** predates RHTP and will persist after federal funding ends. HHSC requires annual state legislative appropriations to maintain operations. RHTP funds cannot supplant these general fund allocations, meaning the underlying sustainability challenge remains unaddressed.

**Technology procurement and implementation** at the scale envisioned by RHIN and Pili Ola will prove challenging. Rural facilities with limited IT staff face steep adoption curves for new systems. Interoperability promises often exceed actual achievements. The two-year obligation requirement creates timeline pressure that may force premature technology decisions.

**Sustainability Beyond 2030**

Hawaii faces the same 2030 cliff as all RHTP recipients, but with distinctive vulnerabilities. The **ocean barriers** that define the state's rural health challenge are permanent. Technology investments can reduce their impact but cannot eliminate the fundamental constraint of archipelago geography.

The initiatives most likely to survive post-RHTP include:
- **Telehealth infrastructure** once built, requires maintenance funding rather than capital investment
- **EHR interoperability** once achieved, becomes embedded in standard operations
- **Medical respite model** if demonstrating reduced hospitalization costs, could attract Medicaid or philanthropic support

The initiatives facing greatest post-2030 risk include:
- **Workforce scholarships and incentives** requiring ongoing program funding
- **Mobile health units** with continuing operational costs
- **Telehealth navigator positions** dependent on grant support

Hawaii's **value-based care accelerator** represents an explicit sustainability strategy, preparing providers for payment models that could support transformation goals through Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement rather than grant dependence.

## Conclusion

Hawaii's RHTP award reflects **strong application quality** compensating for limited rural population scale. The state secured funding among the highest per-capita nationally, creating meaningful investment capacity despite geographic constraints that inflate per-service costs.

The strategy's **technology-centered approach** makes sense for an archipelago where physical consolidation is impossible. If RHIN and Pili Ola achieve genuine interoperability and telehealth access, Hawaii's rural residents could experience meaningfully improved specialty access without leaving their islands for every consultation.

The strategy's **vulnerability lies in workforce** and the structural economics of maintaining facilities on low-volume islands. Technology cannot perform surgery, deliver babies, or respond to trauma. Hawaii needs more physicians, nurses, and EMS personnel actually living and practicing on neighbor islands. HOME RUN addresses this challenge directionally, but decades of pipeline development cannot resolve immediate shortages.

Success will require **realistic assessment** of what transformation can achieve by 2030 and what sustainability mechanisms must be in place before federal funding ends. Hawaii's small scale paradoxically makes both the stakes and the potential for meaningful impact higher than in larger states where RHTP represents a smaller share of total rural health investment.
