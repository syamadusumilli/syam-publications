The Rural Health Transformation Program's social determinants of health infrastructure reveals a stark divide between states treating social care as fundamental transformation architecture and those relegating it to rhetorical flourish. This 50-state analysis tracks what states proposed for SDOH screening, health-related social need navigation, community health worker deployment, and community information exchange platforms, then assesses what survived the collision between ambitious applications and constrained implementation realities. The findings expose social care components as among the most vulnerable elements in rural transformation efforts, consistently ranking around 15th on hospital CEO priority lists behind workforce recruitment, technology upgrades, and operational stabilization.

The analytical framework distinguishes between genuinely funded initiatives with dedicated budget lines, partially funded components vulnerable to further cuts, embedded programs lacking standalone infrastructure, and explicitly eliminated elements. Six states emerge with protected social care investment: Tennessee preserves its Community Compass platform and local health department navigators with approximately $20-25 million in dedicated funding; North Carolina maintains NCCARE360's Unite Us deployment and hub-based navigation with similar allocations; Oregon leverages coordinated care organization mandates to integrate social services; Wisconsin plans Medicaid state plan amendment pathways for community health worker sustainability; West Virginia emphasizes workforce expansion through academic partnerships; Kentucky structures chronic care hubs to include navigation as design requirements rather than optional add-ons.

These successful states share defining characteristics that distinguish them from peers experiencing social care erosion. All six built RHTP investments atop pre-existing infrastructure rather than attempting greenfield deployments. Tennessee's Community Compass predates the federal program, allowing RHTP funds to enhance rather than create referral architecture. North Carolina's NCCARE360 achieved operational maturity before transformation dollars arrived, reducing implementation risk and building stakeholder confidence. **Platform maturity emerges as the single strongest predictor of social care survival** during budget triage, suggesting states lacking established systems face enormous disadvantages in protecting these components against competing priorities.

The sustainability dimension reveals additional stratification among states. Tennessee, North Carolina, and Oregon identified post-2030 funding mechanisms before program launch, primarily through managed care organization contracts and Medicaid reimbursement pathways. Wisconsin's deliberate pursuit of a Medicaid SPA for community health worker services represents calculated planning for the inevitable federal funding cliff. States attempting social care integration without comparable sustainability architecture face predictable collapse when transformation dollars expire, creating five-year employment commitments that cannot survive transition to state operational budgets.

Georgia represents the opposite extreme, with zero SDOH screening, navigation, or platform investment despite receiving $219 million in total RHTP funding. The state's application prioritized telehealth infrastructure, workforce recruitment, and hospital operational support while explicitly declining social care components. This reflects not oversight but deliberate stakeholder prioritization, revealing how rural hospital administrators consistently rank social determinants work below immediate operational concerns. **The absence proves more analytically significant than presence**, demonstrating that federal transformation dollars cannot compel state investment in domains where local stakeholders perceive limited return on investment.

Texas illustrates a subtler failure mode: data capture without service delivery infrastructure. The state embeds SDOH screening tools within clinical workflows and allocates $9-12 million for community health worker deployment, creating capacity to identify food insecurity, housing instability, and transportation barriers. However, **Texas funds no statewide community information exchange platform and lacks closed-loop referral architecture**, leaving identified needs unresolved. This screening-without-resolution pattern satisfies federal reporting requirements while failing to address the underlying social conditions affecting health outcomes. Patients receive diagnoses of social need but no mechanism for connecting to community resources, creating documentation of problems without pathways to solutions.

The community health worker deployment landscape reveals parallel tensions between training pipelines and employment infrastructure. Texas targets 500 new workers plus 300 existing employees, establishing certification pathways through the Department of State Health Services while funding hybrid employment across federally qualified health centers, local health departments, community-based organizations, and managed care organizations. Tennessee funds 60-100 workers through 20 organizations using Tennessee Community Health Worker Association accreditation, concentrating on provider-employed models. North Carolina aims to add 200 workers annually through its established community college system, distributing employment across clinical and community settings.

The employer model classification exposes fundamental sustainability challenges embedded in these workforce investments. Provider-employed community health workers achieve stronger clinical integration and supervision structures but become first-line targets during budget crises, as hospital administrators eliminate positions tangential to core revenue-generating services. Community organization employment preserves mission alignment and community trust but depends on perpetually unstable grant funding, creating workforce churn that undermines program effectiveness. Managed care organization employment offers sustainable funding streams through capitated rates but risks mission drift toward cost reduction rather than community health improvement. **The absence of viable long-term employer models suggests most RHTP community health worker positions face elimination when federal dollars expire**, regardless of demonstrated effectiveness in connecting rural patients to social services.

California's regional fragmentation compounds these structural challenges. The state requested $35-50 million for social care integration aligned with CalAIM Medicaid redesign but received approximately $20-30 million, forcing regional prioritization that leaves significant rural areas without coverage. Multiple community information exchange platforms operate without coordination: Unite Us serves some regions, Findhelp operates in others, 211 systems provide basic information without closed-loop referral capability. **Platform fragmentation prevents statewide data aggregation, eliminates economies of scale, and creates coordination barriers that replicate the siloing these systems theoretically address**. Rural providers attempting to navigate this landscape face different referral architectures across county lines, undermining adoption and reinforcing existing patterns of clinical care divorced from social context.

The technology vendor analysis reveals market concentration around two dominant national platforms. Unite Us operates in 43-plus states with $1.6 billion-plus valuation, positioning as the market leader for community information exchange with deployments in North Carolina, Oregon, California regions, Iowa, Washington areas, and Texas fragments. Findhelp maintains national resource directory presence with approximately $200 million valuation, securing state contracts in Tennessee, West Virginia, California regions, Texas fragments, and Kentucky areas. NobleSG occupies a distinct niche with government-focused platforms, operating Montana's state-run CONNECT system and maintaining tribal health program relationships but limited commercial penetration beyond public sector contracts.

Most platforms originated in urban healthcare environments with dense provider networks and robust community-based organization infrastructure, creating rural deployment gaps that vendors struggle to address. Sparse CBO networks mean referral systems point to nonexistent services in many rural counties. Connectivity limitations affect platform usability where reliable internet access remains inconsistent. Provider EHR variation requires broader integration portfolios than vendors typically maintain, as small rural practices use diverse systems rather than Epic or Cerner installations. Distance and transportation barriers demand mobile-first workflows rather than facility-based referral assumptions. **Vendor adaptation to rural contexts remains incomplete across the market**, with Findhelp demonstrating stronger rural presence through simpler interfaces and broader resource directories, while Unite Us maintains urban-centric design assumptions despite rural deployments.

The correlation between Medicaid expansion status and social care investment strength proves statistically significant but not deterministic. Expansion states (North Carolina, Oregon, Washington, Kentucky, West Virginia) demonstrate stronger social care integration overall, reflecting both philosophical alignment with comprehensive coverage and fiscal capacity to fund wraparound services. Non-expansion states (Texas, Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama) generally prioritize clinical infrastructure over social care, consistent with skepticism toward government-funded service coordination. **Tennessee represents the critical exception**, maintaining non-expansion status while building robust social care infrastructure through pre-existing TennCare managed care architecture and deliberate state investment independent of federal expansion dollars. This outlier suggests that institutional infrastructure and state commitment can overcome ideological resistance to expansion-associated policy frameworks.

Mississippi occupies a troubling position in the analysis: unknown status across virtually all social care domains. The state's $206 million award includes references to Community Resource Information Systems (CRIS) but lacks public documentation of SDOH screening protocols, health-related social need navigation infrastructure, community health worker deployment plans, or community information exchange platform procurement. This absence might reflect genuine implementation gaps, information opacity rather than programmatic deficits, or embedding of social care within other initiatives without distinct visibility. **The analytical opacity itself proves significant**, suggesting either minimal stakeholder engagement with social care integration or institutional barriers to transparent implementation planning that should concern federal overseers.

Ohio demonstrates fragmentation without coordination despite significant rural populations and substantial RHTP funding. The state maintains the Pathways HUB model for maternal and infant health but provides no dedicated SDOH investment beyond existing programs. Multiple disconnected platforms operate: 211 systems offer basic information, Pathways serves defined populations, but no statewide architecture coordinates referrals or enables data aggregation. **The perpetuation of existing silos under transformation funding represents a failure mode distinct from complete absence**, where states receive substantial federal investment without addressing the structural coordination barriers that social care integration theoretically resolves.

The funding adequacy analysis reveals systematic undercapitalization of social care components relative to stated ambitions. High investment states (Tennessee, Kentucky, North Carolina) allocate over $10 million for community health worker deployment, enabling meaningful workforce expansion with plausible employment absorption. Moderate investment states ($5
