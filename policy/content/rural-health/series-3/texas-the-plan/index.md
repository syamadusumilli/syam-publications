Part 1 established the baseline: **$281.3 million for 4.7 million rural Texans** translates to $60 per person annually, the lowest per capita allocation in the nation. Eighty-two rural hospitals face closure risk. Twenty-five have already closed. The coverage gap traps 1.4 million Texans between Medicaid eligibility and marketplace subsidies. These are the conditions the Texas Health and Human Services Commission must transform with resources that fund demonstration projects rather than systemic change.

Texas responded with **"Rural Texas Strong: Supporting Health and Wellness"**, a six-initiative strategy emphasizing technology deployment, federal priority alignment, and competitive subaward distribution. The application requested approximately $1.4 billion over five years. It received roughly 20 percent of that request. This article examines what Texas proposes to do with what it received.

The strategic approach reflects calculated trade-offs. HHSC prioritized initiatives that demonstrate measurable progress within annual re-scoring cycles, align with Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) wellness priorities, and leverage existing organizational infrastructure. Workforce pipelines and care delivery transformation, which require decade-long investment horizons, receive less emphasis than technology deployment and wellness programming that can show results quickly.

**The central premise**: technology and wellness initiatives aligned with federal priorities can demonstrate enough progress to maintain funding while longer-term transformation slowly builds. Whether this premise holds will determine if Texas's 4.7 million rural residents see meaningful healthcare improvement or merely administrative activity.

## The Strategic Framework

### Governance Structure

The **Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC)** serves as lead agency for all RHTP implementation. The Health and Human Services Executive Commissioner bears statutory responsibility for program administration, reporting, and compliance with CMS cooperative agreement requirements.

HHSC established a **Rural Health Transformation Program Office** with 20 additional full-time equivalent positions dedicated entirely to program planning, implementation, and monitoring. The Program Director serves as primary external contact, coordinating with CMS, managing subaward relationships, and directing staff across initiative activities.

| Role | Function |
|------|----------|
| Executive Commissioner | Ultimate accountability, policy direction |
| Program Director | Day-to-day management, CMS liaison |
| Initiative Coordinators | Subject-matter leads for each of six initiatives |
| Grants Management | Subaward administration, compliance |
| Data and Evaluation | Performance monitoring, reporting |
| Regional Liaisons | Stakeholder coordination across five regions |

The governance structure intentionally centralizes control at the state level. Unlike models that delegate substantial authority to regional intermediaries, Texas maintains HHSC as the primary decision-maker for all significant funding allocations. Subawardees receive funds through HHSC contracts rather than through regional entities with autonomous grant-making authority.

### Theory of Change

The Texas application operates on a **technology-first, alignment-optimized theory of change**. The logic model:

1. **Federal alignment secures funding continuity.** Annual re-scoring rewards states demonstrating initiative progress and policy alignment. Texas brands initiatives around MAHA priorities to maximize scoring position for subsequent years.

2. **Technology extends capacity faster than workforce development.** Training new providers takes seven to ten years. Deploying AI-enhanced telehealth takes twelve to eighteen months. Technology investments show results within RHTP's timeline; workforce investments do not.

3. **Competitive subaward distribution identifies capable implementers.** Rather than directing funds through established channels that may lack implementation capacity, competitive processes surface organizations with demonstrated execution ability.

4. **Wellness programming addresses chronic disease upstream.** Preventing diabetes and cardiovascular disease costs less than treating them. Lifestyle interventions require less clinical infrastructure than acute care.

5. **Rural hospitals stabilize through efficiency rather than direct subsidy.** RHTP prohibits provider payments to supplement existing revenue. Equipment upgrades and technology deployment improve operational efficiency within permissible uses of funds.

The theory's vulnerabilities include technology prerequisites (broadband, digital literacy) that remain unmet in significant portions of rural Texas, coverage gaps that prevent transformed systems from serving patients who cannot afford care, and timeline pressures that favor demonstrable activity over structural improvement.

### Core Initiatives and Interrelationships

The six initiatives form an interconnected system, though some connections are stronger than others:

```

The technology layer provides infrastructure enabling remote care delivery. The delivery layer builds physical and human capacity. The wellness layer addresses population health upstream of clinical encounter. In theory, all three layers reinforce each other. In practice, funding constraints force prioritization of technology and wellness over delivery infrastructure.

## Initiative 1: Lone Star Advanced AI and Telehealth

### Design and Mechanics

The flagship technology initiative deploys **AI-assisted clinical decision support** integrated with existing telehealth platforms. Rural primary care providers gain access to specialist consultation through systems that identify high-risk presentations, suggest diagnostic pathways, and facilitate virtual specialist referral.

Core components:

**AI Triage and Decision Support**: Machine learning algorithms analyze patient presentations against clinical databases, flagging conditions requiring specialist consultation, suggesting evidence-based treatment pathways, and identifying patients at elevated risk for hospitalization.

**Telehealth Platform Expansion**: Building on existing infrastructure (TORCH telehealth network, academic medical center programs), the initiative extends synchronous video consultation capacity to rural hospitals and clinics currently lacking reliable connectivity.

**Remote Patient Monitoring**: Chronic disease management through home-based devices transmitting vital signs, blood glucose, weight, and other metrics to care teams who intervene before acute episodes require hospitalization.

### Target Population and Geography

The initiative prioritizes **communities with existing broadband infrastructure** capable of supporting video consultation and data transmission. This creates tension between reaching the most underserved populations and deploying technology where it can function reliably.

Primary deployment targets:

| Region | Population Served | Rationale |
|--------|------------------|-----------|
| East Texas (connected areas) | ~250,000 | High need, moderate connectivity |
| Panhandle (regional hubs) | ~150,000 | Extreme distances require virtual care |
| Hill Country | ~200,000 | Better connectivity, aging population |
| Border (urban-adjacent) | ~200,000 | High volume, some infrastructure |

**Frontier counties and unconnected rural areas** receive lower priority for initial deployment, awaiting BEAD Program broadband buildout that may or may not occur on compatible timelines.

### Funding Allocation

**Estimated: $65-75 million (FY2026)**

| Component | Allocation | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| AI platform licensing and deployment | $20-25M | Enterprise licenses, customization |
| Telehealth equipment and installation | $15-20M | Hardware for provider sites |
| Remote monitoring devices and programs | $15-20M | Patient devices, monitoring infrastructure |
| Training and technical assistance | $8-10M | Provider education, support |
| Evaluation and analytics | $5-8M | Outcome tracking, program refinement |

### Subawardees

HHSC will award funds through **competitive procurement** rather than directed allocation. Eligible applicants include:

- Rural hospitals and hospital districts
- Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs)
- Rural Health Clinics (RHCs)
- Academic medical centers (for telehealth hub functions)
- Telehealth technology vendors
- Healthcare cooperatives with 60% or greater rural provider composition

Key organizational players likely to receive subawards:

| Organization | Role | Anticipated Function |
|--------------|------|---------------------|
| **TORCH** (Texas Organization of Rural & Community Hospitals) | Intermediary/Provider | Telehealth network expansion, member coordination |
| **Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center** | Academic Hub | Telehealth consultation, workforce training |
| **UT System Regional Centers** | Academic Hub | Specialist consultation, AI deployment |
| **Texas A&M Rural Health Initiatives** | Academic Hub | Technology deployment, evaluation |
| **Major telehealth vendors (to be selected)** | Technology | Platform provision, support |

### Performance Metrics

| Metric | FY2026 Target | FY2030 Target |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| Telehealth-equipped sites | 200 facilities | 500 facilities |
| AI-assisted consultations | 50,000 | 250,000 |
| Remote monitoring patients | 10,000 | 75,000 |
| Preventable ED visits avoided | 2,500 | 15,000 |
| Provider time saved (hours) | 100,000 | 500,000 |

### Implementation Timeline

| Phase | Timeline | Activities |
|-------|----------|------------|
| Procurement | Q1-Q2 FY2026 | RFP development, vendor selection, site identification |
| Pilot Deployment | Q3-Q4 FY2026 | Initial site installations, training, workflow integration |
| Scale-Up | FY2027 | Regional expansion based on pilot results |
| Statewide (partial) | FY2028-2030 | Continued expansion within connected areas |

## Initiative 2: Consumer Technology Engagement

### Design and Mechanics

This initiative deploys **patient-facing digital tools** enabling rural Texans to manage health information, access educational resources, communicate with providers, and schedule services. The approach assumes digital engagement improves health behaviors and care adherence.

Core components:

**Patient Portal Expansion**: Extending electronic health record portal access to patients at rural facilities currently lacking patient-facing digital infrastructure.

**Mobile Health Applications**: Deploying smartphone applications for appointment scheduling, medication reminders, symptom tracking, and health education.

**Health Literacy Tools**: Digital content (video, interactive modules, multilingual materials) addressing common health conditions, preventive care, and navigation of the healthcare system.

**Social Needs Screening Integration**: Digital intake tools capturing social determinants of health data, connecting patients to community resources for food, housing, transportation, and other non-clinical needs.

### Target Population

**Primary focus**: Rural Texans with smartphone access, basic digital literacy, and connectivity sufficient for mobile app use.

**Acknowledged gap**: Significant portions of rural Texas population lack one or more prerequisites. The application notes that 28 percent of rural Texas households lack broadband meeting federal standards. Smartphone ownership, while high overall, correlates with income and age, leaving older and poorer rural residents underserved by digital engagement strategies.

### Funding Allocation

**Estimated: $25-30 million (FY2026)**

| Component | Allocation | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| Portal infrastructure | $10-12M | EHR vendor integration, patient registration |
| Mobile app development/licensing | $6-8M | Custom or licensed applications |
| Content development | $4-5M | Educational materials, translations |
| Digital literacy training | $3-4M | Patient and community education |
| Social needs screening tools | $2-3M | SDOH intake, resource directories |

### Subawardees

Competitive awards to:
- Rural hospitals implementing portal expansion
- FQHCs deploying patient engagement tools
- Community-based organizations providing digital literacy training
- Technology vendors selected through procurement

### Social Needs Screening Integration

This component represents Texas's **primary SDOH/HRSN initiative**. The design:

1. **Screening at intake**: Digital tools capture housing stability, food security, transportation access, and other social needs during patient registration or annual wellness visits.

2. **Resource connection**: Screening results trigger referrals to community resources, initially through information provision (resource directories) with aspiration toward closed-loop referral systems.

3. **Data capture**: Social needs data feeds back to providers and potentially to state-level dashboards for population health planning.

**Limitations**: The initiative emphasizes screening over resolution. Identifying social needs does not guarantee resources exist to address them. Rural Texas has fewer community-based organizations, food banks, transportation services, and housing programs than urban areas. Screening without resolution capacity may create documentation without improvement.

## Initiative 3: Workforce Pipeline Development

### Design and Mechanics

The workforce initiative addresses rural healthcare staffing shortages through **training, recruitment, and retention programs**. The approach recognizes that workforce development requires sustained investment over timelines exceeding RHTP's five-year window.

Core components:

**Grow-Your-Own Pipelines**: Programs identifying rural high school students with healthcare career interest, supporting them through dual enrollment, undergraduate education, and clinical training with return-service commitments to home communities.

**Training Site Development**: Funding for clinical training capacity at rural hospitals and clinics, increasing the number of medical students, residents, nurses, and allied health students who train in rural settings.

**Scholarship and Loan Repayment**: Financial support for students committing to rural practice, and debt relief for providers already serving rural communities.

**Retention Incentives**: Signing bonuses, housing assistance, childcare support, and continuing education funding to reduce rural provider turnover.

### Target Population and Geography

**Primary focus**: Health professions students and early-career providers willing to commit to rural practice.

**Geographic priority**: Regions with most severe shortages receive priority for training site development and retention incentives:

| Region | Primary Care Shortage | Mental Health Shortage | Priority Level |
|--------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| East Texas | Severe | Near-total | Highest |
| Border Region | Severe | Severe | Highest |
| Panhandle | Moderate-Severe | Severe | High |
| West Texas Frontier | Severe | Near-total | High |
| Hill Country | Moderate | Moderate | Lower |

### Funding Allocation

**Estimated: $35-45 million (FY2026)**

| Component | Allocation | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| Pipeline programs | $12-15M | High school through residency support |
| Training site development | $10-12M | Clinical capacity at rural facilities |
| Scholarships and loan repayment | $8-10M | Direct student/provider support |
| Retention incentives | $5-8M | Signing bonuses, housing, support |

### Subawardees

| Organization Type | Role | Examples |
|------------------|------|----------|
| **Area Health Education Centers (AHECs)** | Pipeline coordination | South Texas AHEC, West Texas AHEC |
| **Academic medical centers** | Training programs | Texas Tech, UT System, Texas A&M |
| **Rural hospitals** | Training sites | CAHs with teaching capacity |
| **Community colleges** | Allied health training | Regional nursing programs |

### Community Health Worker Programs

Texas maintains an established **Community Health Worker (CHW) or Promotor(a) certification program** through the Department of State Health Services. As of 2024, Texas certified **8,666 CHWs** serving 189 counties, a 33 percent increase from 2023.

The RHTP workforce initiative includes CHW expansion:

| Component | Description | Allocation |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| CHW training expansion | Additional certification courses, rural focus | $3-4M |
| CHW employer support | Funds for rural organizations hiring CHWs | $4-5M |
| CHW supervision infrastructure | Clinical oversight for CHW activities | $2-3M |

**CHW Deployment Targets**:
- Train 500 additional CHWs in rural areas over five years
- Support employment for 300 CHWs at rural health organizations
- Develop 15 new CHW training sites in underserved regions

**Employer landscape**: CHWs in Texas work through FQHCs, local health departments, hospitals, community-based organizations, and managed care organizations. The Texas Association of Promotores and CHWs provides statewide networking and advocacy.

### Performance Metrics

| Metric | FY2026 Target | FY2030 Target |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| Pipeline program enrollees | 500 | 3,000 |
| Training site expansions | 20 | 75 |
| Scholarships awarded | 100 | 600 |
| Retention incentives provided | 150 | 750 |
| CHWs trained | 100 | 500 |
| HPSA designations filled | 10 | 50 |

### Implementation Timeline

| Phase | Timeline | Activities |
|-------|----------|------------|
| Partner identification | Q1-Q2 FY2026 | RFPs for AHECs, academic partners |
| Program development | Q2-Q4 FY2026 | Curriculum design, pipeline establishment |
| Initial cohorts | FY2027 | First scholarship recipients, training site launches |
| Scale-up | FY2028-2030 | Expanded enrollment, additional sites |
| First graduates | FY2032+ | Pipeline students complete training (post-RHTP) |

**Critical gap**: Workforce pipeline programs produce practicing providers seven to ten years after initial enrollment. The first students entering RHTP-funded pipelines in 2026 will not complete residency training until 2033 or later, three years after RHTP funding ends. Sustainability planning for pipeline programs must begin immediately.

## Initiative 4: Make Rural Texans Healthy Again

### Design and Mechanics

Explicitly branded around **MAHA priorities**, this initiative deploys wellness and chronic disease prevention programming aligned with federal emphasis on lifestyle-based health improvement. The initiative accesses RHTP's **$12 billion MAHA-dedicated funding stream**, positioning Texas for favorable scoring in annual re-evaluation.

Core components:

**Chronic Disease Prevention Grants**: Competitive funding for community organizations implementing diabetes prevention, cardiovascular risk reduction, and obesity intervention programs.

**Nutrition Services**: Support for farmers markets, community gardens, food access programs, and nutrition counseling integration with primary care.

**Community Fitness**: Partnerships with fitness centers, schools, and employers to expand physical activity opportunities in rural communities.

**Wellness Coaching**: Training and deployment of wellness coaches who support behavior change for diet, exercise, tobacco cessation, and stress management.

**School-Based Health Promotion**: Programs in rural schools addressing nutrition education, physical activity, mental health awareness, and substance abuse prevention.

### Target Population

**Primary focus**: Rural Texans with or at risk for chronic disease, particularly:
- Adults with prediabetes or metabolic syndrome
- Individuals with hypertension or cardiovascular risk factors
- Youth at risk for obesity
- Communities with limited healthy food access

### SNAP Policy Alignment

Texas adopted rules **banning SNAP purchases of candy and soda**, a policy action specifically noted in the RHTP application as evidence of state commitment to MAHA priorities. The restriction:

- Aligns with federal emphasis on dietary improvement through purchase limitations
- Factored into RHTP scoring for policy actions supporting wellness
- Evidence of health impact is mixed; policy alignment value is clear

### Performance Metrics

| Metric | FY2026 Target | FY2030 Target |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| Diabetes Prevention Program enrollees | 5,000 | 30,000 |

| School-based program participants | 50,000 | 250,000 |
| A1C improvements (DPP completers) | 0.5% average | 0.5% average |

## Initiative 5: Cybersecurity Enhancement

### Design and Mechanics

Rural healthcare organizations face increasing **cybersecurity threats** while operating with limited IT resources. The initiative funds security assessments, vulnerability remediation, and staff training to protect patient data and operational systems.

Core components:

**Security Assessments**: Professional evaluation of rural hospital and clinic IT systems, identifying vulnerabilities and compliance gaps.

**Vulnerability Remediation**: Funding for security improvements including network segmentation, endpoint protection, backup systems, and access controls.

**Staff Training**: Cybersecurity awareness education for healthcare workers, addressing phishing, password security, and incident response.

**Incident Response Planning**: Development of cybersecurity incident response protocols and business continuity plans.

### Target Population

**Primary beneficiaries**: Rural hospitals, FQHCs, and RHCs with limited IT security capacity.

**Eligibility criteria**: Facilities demonstrating security gaps through assessment and lacking resources for remediation.

### Funding Allocation

**Estimated: $15-20 million (FY2026)**

| Component | Allocation | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| Security assessments | $4-5M | Third-party evaluations |
| Vulnerability remediation | $8-10M | Security improvements |
| Staff training | $2-3M | Education programs |
| Incident response planning | $1-2M | Protocol development |

### Subawardees

- Rural hospitals and hospital districts
- FQHCs and RHCs
- Cybersecurity vendors (selected through procurement)
- Texas Health Services Authority (potential coordination role)

## Initiative 6: Infrastructure and Capital Investments

### Design and Mechanics

The infrastructure initiative funds **equipment upgrades and facility improvements** at rural healthcare organizations. RHTP prohibits direct payment for provider services but permits capital investments enhancing operational capacity.

Core components:

**Medical Equipment**: Replacement of aging diagnostic and treatment equipment at rural facilities.

**Health Information Technology**: EHR upgrades, interoperability improvements, and data exchange infrastructure.

**Facility Improvements**: Physical plant upgrades supporting care delivery (not construction of new facilities).

**Emergency Capacity**: Equipment and infrastructure supporting emergency response and stabilization.

### Target Population

**Primary beneficiaries**: Critical Access Hospitals, rural hospitals, FQHCs, and RHCs with demonstrated infrastructure needs.

**Geographic priority**: Facilities in highest-need regions and those at financial risk receive preference.

### Funding Allocation

**Estimated: $45-55 million (FY2026)**

| Component | Allocation | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| Medical equipment | $20-25M | Diagnostic, treatment devices |
| Health IT | $12-15M | EHR, interoperability |
| Facility improvements | $8-10M | Physical plant upgrades |
| Emergency capacity | $5-7M | EMS, stabilization equipment |

### Subawardees

Competitive awards to:
- Critical Access Hospitals (84 in Texas)
- Other rural hospitals
- FQHCs (400+ sites statewide)
- Rural Health Clinics

### Equipment Priorities

| Priority | Equipment Type | Rationale |
|----------|---------------|-----------|
| Highest | Imaging (CT, X-ray, ultrasound) | Diagnostic capacity critical |
| High | Laboratory equipment | Point-of-care testing |
| High | EHR/interoperability | Care coordination |
| Medium | Telemedicine hardware | Technology initiative support |
| Medium | Emergency department equipment | Stabilization capacity |

## Social Care Integration

### SDOH/HRSN Initiatives

Texas's RHTP application includes **social determinants of health screening** as a component of the Consumer Technology Engagement initiative rather than a standalone program. The approach:

**Screening requirements**: Digital intake tools capture social needs data (housing, food, transportation, safety) during patient encounters at RHTP-funded sites.

**Navigation**: Limited navigation capacity connects patients to existing community resources. The application does not fund robust navigation infrastructure or dedicated social needs navigators.

**Data capture**: Social needs data feeds state-level dashboards for population health planning, though action on that data depends on resources outside RHTP scope.

| SDOH Component | Status in Texas Application |
|----------------|----------------------------|
| Screening requirements | Included (digital tools) |
| Navigation infrastructure | Limited |
| Dedicated navigators | Not funded |
| Closed-loop referral system | Aspirational, not funded |
| Resource directory maintenance | Partial |

### Community Health Worker Programs

As detailed in Initiative 3, Texas includes **CHW expansion** within workforce development:

| Element | FY2026 Plan | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| CHW training pipeline | 100 new certifications | Funded |
| CHW employment support | Grants to rural employers | Funded |
| Supervision infrastructure | Clinical oversight capacity | Partially funded |
| Statewide deployment targets | 500 additional CHWs (5-year) | Targeted |

**Employer landscape**: Texas Medicaid managed care organizations may categorize CHW expenditures as quality improvement costs under HB113 (2023). House Bill 1575 established Case Management for Children and Pregnant Women Medicaid benefit using CHWs alongside nurses and social workers. These policy developments create employment pathways beyond RHTP funding.

### Community Information Exchange and Referral Platforms

Texas's application **does not mandate specific CIE platform procurement**. The approach:

**Current state**: Texas lacks a statewide community information exchange platform. Regional 211 systems provide resource directories with varying levels of integration with healthcare systems. Some FQHCs and health systems use Unite Us, Findhelp, or similar platforms independently.

**RHTP approach**: The application includes "resource connection" functionality in digital screening tools but does not fund dedicated CIE platform procurement or statewide infrastructure.

**Interoperability**: EHR integration for social needs referrals remains aspirational. Health IT infrastructure funding could support interoperability, but CIE integration is not explicitly prioritized.

| CIE Element | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| Statewide platform | Not funded |
| Regional integration | Not explicitly funded |
| EHR interoperability | Within HIT funding (not prioritized) |
| 211 integration | Not addressed |
| Resource directory | Partial (digital tools) |

### Technology Vendor Landscape

**Current SDOH/CIE platforms operating in Texas**:

| Platform | Presence | Coverage |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Unite Us | Active | Multiple health systems, some FQHCs |
| Findhelp (formerly Aunt Bertha) | Active | Widespread resource directory use |
| 211 Texas | Statewide | Information and referral |
| Health system proprietary | Various | System-specific solutions |

**Procurement status**: No active statewide procurement for CIE platforms under RHTP. Individual subawardees may use RHTP funds for platform licensing within their awards.

**Vendor gaps**: Rural areas have less CIE coverage than urban regions. Platform functionality is limited where community-based organization infrastructure is sparse. The challenge is not the technology but the resource ecosystem it connects to.

## Social Care Integration Assessment

| Component | Funded | Survival Likelihood | Notes |
|-----------|--------|---------------------|-------|
| SDOH screening | Yes | High | Embedded in technology initiative |
| Navigation services | Partial | Moderate | Limited scope |
| CHW deployment | Yes | Moderate-High | Within workforce initiative |
| CIE platform | No | Low | Not prioritized |
| Closed-loop referrals | No | Very Low | Not funded |

**Assessment**: Texas's social care integration focuses on **data capture over service delivery**. Screening identifies needs; resolution depends on resources outside RHTP scope. This reflects a pragmatic recognition that social care infrastructure in rural Texas is thin, and RHTP funding cannot build that infrastructure while simultaneously addressing healthcare transformation.

## Stakeholder Architecture

### Lead Agency

**Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC)**: Statutory lead for RHTP implementation, housing the Rural Health Transformation Program Office, managing all subawards, and bearing accountability for program outcomes.

### Key Partner Organizations

| Organization | Role | RHTP Function |
|--------------|------|---------------|
| **Texas Department of State Health Services** | State health agency | Technical expertise, CHW program, data |
| **Texas Office of Rural Health** | Rural health coordination | Stakeholder engagement, program design |
| **TORCH** | Rural hospital association | Member coordination, telehealth network |
| **Texas Hospital Association** | Hospital advocacy | Policy alignment, member engagement |
| **Texas Primary Care Association** | FQHC network | FQHC coordination, implementation |
| **Academic medical centers** | Training and consultation | Workforce pipelines, telehealth hubs |
| **AHECs** | Workforce development | Pipeline programs, CHW training |

### Provider Participation Requirements

Subawardees must:
- Demonstrate capacity for proposed activities
- Serve populations meeting rural designation criteria
- Comply with CMS reporting requirements
- Participate in state evaluation activities
- Meet performance milestones within award period

### Community Organization Involvement

Community-based organizations participate primarily through:
- Wellness initiative grants (disease prevention, nutrition, fitness)
- CHW employment (as CHW employers receiving workforce funds)
- Digital literacy training (consumer technology initiative)

The application does not establish formal community advisory structures or require community governance participation in subawardee organizations.

### Payer Relationships

RHTP funding flows **directly from CMS to HHSC to providers**, bypassing managed care organizations entirely. Payer involvement is limited to:

- Medicaid MCOs as potential CHW employers (outside RHTP)
- MCO quality improvement initiatives that may align with RHTP goals
- Potential future sustainability through MCO contracts (post-RHTP)

Commercial payers have no formal role in RHTP implementation.

## Budget Flow and Timeline

### Allocation Across Initiatives

| Initiative | FY2026 | Percentage |
|------------|--------|------------|
| Lone Star AI and Telehealth | $65-75M | 23-27% |
| Consumer Technology | $25-30M | 9-11% |
| Workforce Pipeline | $35-45M | 12-16% |
| Make Rural Texans Healthy Again | $50-60M | 18-21% |
| Cybersecurity | $15-20M | 5-7% |
| Infrastructure and Capital | $45-55M | 16-20% |
| Administration | $20-25M | 7-9% |
| **Total** | **$281.3M** | **100%** |

### Subaward Structure

Texas uses **competitive procurement** for most initiative funding:

1. HHSC issues Requests for Proposals (RFPs) for each initiative
2. Eligible organizations submit applications
3. Review panels evaluate proposals against scoring criteria
4. HHSC awards contracts to successful applicants
5. Subawardees receive funds through HHSC contracts
6. HHSC monitors performance and compliance

**Timeline for competitive awards**:
- RFP development: Q1 FY2026
- Application period: Q2 FY2026
- Review and selection: Q2-Q3 FY2026
- Contract execution: Q3 FY2026
- Implementation begins: Q3-Q4 FY2026

### Administrative Retention

HHSC retains **approximately 7-9%** of total award for program administration:

| Administrative Function | Estimated Cost |
|------------------------|----------------|
| Program Office staffing (20 FTEs) | $4-5M |
| Grants management | $3-4M |
| Data and evaluation | $4-5M |
| Technical assistance | $3-4M |
| Reporting and compliance | $2-3M |
| Indirect costs | $4-5M |

### Performance Monitoring

HHSC monitors subawardee performance through:
- Quarterly progress reports
- Financial reporting and audit
- Site visits (selected subawardees)
- Data dashboard tracking key metrics
- Annual outcome evaluation

### Two-Year Obligation Requirement

RHTP requires states to **obligate FY2026 funds within two years** (by September 30, 2027). Texas's competitive procurement timeline creates risk:

| Phase | Timeline | Risk Level |
|-------|----------|------------|
| RFP development | Oct 2025 - Jan 2026 | Low |
| Application period | Feb - Apr 2026 | Low |
| Review and selection | May - Jul 2026 | Moderate |
| Contract execution | Aug - Oct 2026 | Moderate |
| Implementation | Nov 2026 - Sep 2027 | Elevated |
| Full obligation | By Sep 2027 | Manageable |

The timeline is tight but achievable if procurement proceeds without major delays.

## What the Plan Assumes

### Explicit Assumptions

The Texas application explicitly states:

1. **Technology prerequisites exist or will emerge.** Broadband buildout through BEAD Program will extend connectivity to currently unserved rural areas on timelines compatible with RHTP technology deployment.

2. **Competitive processes identify capable implementers.** Organizations winning subawards have capacity to execute proposed activities within performance periods.

3. **Federal priorities remain stable.** Annual re-scoring will continue to reward MAHA-aligned initiatives and technology deployment emphasis.

4. **State administrative capacity is sufficient.** HHSC can manage multiple concurrent competitive procurements, monitor dozens of subawardees, and meet CMS reporting requirements with proposed staffing.

### Implicit Assumptions

The application implicitly assumes:

1. **Coverage gaps do not prevent transformation.** Rural Texans without insurance will somehow benefit from transformed healthcare systems they cannot afford to use.

2. **Technology substitutes for presence.** Telehealth and remote monitoring adequately replace in-person care for populations where relationships and language concordance matter.

3. **Wellness programming produces health outcomes.** Lifestyle interventions generate measurable improvements in chronic disease metrics proportionate to investment.

4. **Workforce pipelines survive funding cessation.** Programs initiated with RHTP funds will continue after 2030 through state or institutional commitment.

5. **Hospital closure trajectory stabilizes.** RHTP initiatives prevent additional closures despite continued financial pressure from Medicaid cuts and uncompensated care.

### Dependencies on External Factors

| Factor | Dependency Level | Risk |
|--------|-----------------|------|
| Broadband buildout (BEAD) | High | BEAD delays undermine technology initiatives |
| Medicaid cuts (OBBBA) | High | Cuts accelerate hospital closures RHTP cannot prevent |
| Federal scoring criteria | Moderate | Priority changes could disadvantage Texas approach |
| State budget | Moderate | Matching or sustainability funding uncertain |
| Political continuity | Moderate | Administration change could alter MAHA emphasis |

### Risks Acknowledged Versus Ignored

**Acknowledged in application**:
- Broadband limitations in frontier and underserved areas
- Workforce development timeline exceeding RHTP window
- Implementation capacity constraints at rural organizations

**Not explicitly acknowledged**:
- Coverage gap as fundamental barrier to transformation
- Medicaid cuts offsetting RHTP investment
- Scale penalty limiting per-capita impact
- 2030 funding cliff and sustainability
- Technology deployment leaving most vulnerable behind

## Conclusion

Texas proposes to transform rural healthcare for 4.7 million residents with $60 per person annually. The **"Rural Texas Strong"** strategy responds to this constraint by prioritizing initiatives that show results quickly, align with federal scoring priorities, and leverage technology over human infrastructure.

The plan is rational within its constraints. Technology extends capacity faster than workforce development. MAHA alignment positions Texas for continued funding. Competitive subaward processes surface capable implementers. The approach represents pragmatic optimization of a fundamentally inadequate resource base.

The plan's limitations are equally clear. Technology initiatives serve communities with connectivity while bypassing those without. Workforce pipelines produce providers after RHTP ends. Wellness programming addresses lifestyle while coverage gaps prevent care access. Social care integration captures data without building resolution capacity.

**Part 3 will assess** what works, what struggles, what gets cut when resources fall short, and whether Texas's scale penalty ultimately proves insurmountable. The state's 4.7 million rural residents serve as the largest experiment in whether RHTP's theory of change translates to transformed healthcare or merely transformed administration.
