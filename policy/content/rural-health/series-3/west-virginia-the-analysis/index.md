Part 2 documented West Virginia's seven flagship initiatives under Governor Patrick Morrisey's **Health to Prosperity** vision: Connected Care Grid, Rural Health Link, Mountain State Care Force, Smart Care Catalyst, Health to Prosperity Pipeline, Personal Health Accelerator, and HealthTech Appalachia. The plan channels approximately **$199.5 million annually** through the West Virginia Department of Health under Secretary Dr. Arvin Singh's direction, with implementation relying on academic health centers, intermediary organizations, and competitive awards to providers.

This analysis evaluates what actually works, what struggles against implementation headwinds, and what gets cut when plans meet reality. The framework applies pragmatic realism: acknowledging what RHTP can achieve in West Virginia while refusing to pretend **$181 per rural resident** transforms healthcare for 1.1 million people in a state ranked last or near last in virtually every health outcome measure.

**Central question**: Can the Health to Prosperity circular logic, where health improvement drives workforce participation which drives economic revival which sustains health systems, actually function when Medicaid cuts extract resources faster than transformation investments can build capacity?

The evidence suggests certain initiatives will succeed on their own terms, others will struggle against barriers West Virginia cannot control, and the fundamental tension between RHTP investment and Medicaid erosion renders the overall strategy mathematically challenged from inception. West Virginia faces not a question of implementation quality but of structural adequacy.

## What Works

### Connected Care Grid Technology Deployment

**Assessment: Strong Implementation Prospects**

The telehealth and remote monitoring components of Connected Care Grid represent the initiative most likely to achieve lasting impact. West Virginia possesses **existing infrastructure** that RHTP will expand rather than create from scratch: WVU Medicine operates established telehealth networks, and the Mid-Atlantic Telehealth Resource Center provides technical assistance capacity.

**Why it works**:

Technology deployment has **defined deliverables and measurable outputs**. Equipping facilities with telehealth capability, deploying remote monitoring devices, and integrating EHR systems produce tangible results that satisfy federal reporting requirements and demonstrate program activity regardless of ultimate health outcomes.

**WVU Medicine provides a credible implementation partner**. As the state's dominant health system with established telehealth operations and existing findhelp integration for social needs referrals, WVU Medicine can absorb RHTP funding and deploy it efficiently. The organization's EPIC electronic health record provides the backbone for data capture and care coordination.

**Community paramedicine fills a real gap**. EMS treatment-in-place and mobile integrated healthcare address West Virginia's specific geography challenge. Rather than transporting patients across mountain terrain to distant emergency departments, trained paramedics can provide assessment and basic treatment at home. Mountwest Community and Technical College has provided MIH/CP training, creating a foundation for expanded deployment.

**Broadband risk remains**. Connected Care Grid depends on connectivity that does not exist in portions of rural West Virginia. The initiative must coordinate with BEAD Program broadband buildout timelines, potentially delaying deployments in the areas with greatest access barriers. This is a timing constraint rather than a fatal flaw.

| Component | Survival Probability | Rationale |
|-----------|---------------------|-----------|
| Telehealth hub expansion | **High** | Existing infrastructure, clear deliverables |
| Remote monitoring deployment | **High** | Defined equipment procurement |
| Mobile integrated healthcare | **Moderate to High** | Training exists, employer capacity variable |
| EMS treatment-in-place | **Moderate** | Regulatory and payment barriers |

### CHW Training Pipeline Expansion

**Assessment: Strong Survival, Moderate Impact**

West Virginia's CHW infrastructure positions the state to deploy community health workers at scale. The **WVSOM Center for Rural and Community Health CHERP program** offers three-level training preparing community members for health education, outreach, and navigation roles. Marshall University provides complementary training supporting the chronic care management model that demonstrated outcomes in Mingo County.

**Why it works**:

Training programs **produce countable outputs**. Certifications completed, courses delivered, and pipeline graduates represent metrics that satisfy federal reporting requirements and demonstrate program activity. Whether training translates to employment and employment translates to patient outcomes remains uncertain, but training itself will proceed.

**Existing employer infrastructure provides absorption capacity**. FQHCs, managed care organizations, and health systems in West Virginia have hired CHWs under existing programs including the Drug Free Mom and Baby Program. Employer familiarity with CHW roles reduces the onboarding challenge compared to states introducing the workforce category for the first time.

**Medicaid reimbursement pathways exist**. West Virginia has pursued Medicaid reimbursement for CHW services through managed care arrangements. If MCOs integrate CHWs into care models, post-RHTP employment continues through Medicaid payment. This represents one plausible sustainability mechanism, though MCO commitment remains uncertain.

**Supervision and employment absorption constrain impact**. Training workers is simpler than employing them appropriately. Effective CHW deployment requires clinical oversight, employer infrastructure, and integration into care workflows. RHTP can fund training; whether trained workers find employment with adequate supervision depends on organizational commitment beyond training budgets.

### Academic Health Center Partnerships

**Assessment: Strong Implementation Prospects**

West Virginia's concentrated academic health infrastructure positions the state to channel RHTP funding through organizations with demonstrated capacity. **WVU Medicine**, **Marshall Health Network**, and **WVSOM** collectively provide the implementation backbone for workforce, technology, and care delivery initiatives.

**Why it works**:

Academic partners **have absorptive capacity**. Large organizations with grants management infrastructure, clinical faculty, and research capabilities can receive substantial subawards and deploy them efficiently. The alternative, distributing funding across dozens of small organizations, creates administrative burden that delays implementation.

**Residency expansion produces durable capacity**. Graduate medical education slots, once established, persist through Medicare funding. RHTP investment in rural residency positions creates training capacity that outlasts the five-year program window. Physicians who train in rural settings demonstrate higher rural practice rates than urban-trained counterparts.

**The loan forgiveness model has evidence**. West Virginia Higher Education Policy Commission's existing $40,000 loan forgiveness for rural practice commitment provides a template that RHTP will expand. The Return-to-Home scholarship program implementing HB 4768 offers in-state tuition for students committing to equal years of rural practice.

## What Struggles

### Rural Health Link Transportation Coordination

**Assessment: Moderate Implementation Challenges**

The unified medical transportation platform concept addresses a real barrier but faces coordination challenges that funding alone cannot resolve. Rural Health Link envisions connecting multiple transportation providers, volunteer driver networks, and ride-hailing services through a single platform enabling patients to arrange medical transportation regardless of insurance status or service area.

**Why it struggles**:

Transportation coordination requires **relationship building that money cannot accelerate**. Providers operate on different systems, serve different territories, and answer to different authorities. Creating a unified platform requires negotiating data sharing agreements, establishing dispatch protocols, and aligning incentives across organizations with no history of collaboration.

**Vehicle grants do not solve the driver problem**. RHTP can fund vehicles; it cannot create drivers in communities experiencing population decline and workforce shortages. The same factors that create healthcare workforce deficits, declining population, limited employment opportunities, and geographic isolation, constrain transportation workforce development.

**Demand may exceed capacity regardless of coordination**. In areas with sparse population and vast distances, even perfectly coordinated transportation cannot overcome fundamental geography. A patient living 90 minutes from the nearest specialist faces a round-trip requiring three hours of driver time regardless of platform sophistication.

**Payment sustainability remains uncertain**. Medicaid NEMT provides reimbursement for covered populations, but RHTP cannot backfill transportation costs for patients who lose coverage under work requirements or eligibility changes.

### Health to Prosperity Pipeline Recovery-to-Work Programs

**Assessment: Significant Implementation Challenges**

The Health to Prosperity Pipeline positions recovery from substance use disorder as a pathway to workforce participation and economic contribution. The concept reflects West Virginia's specific context as ground zero for the opioid crisis. Implementation faces barriers beyond healthcare system control.

**Why it struggles**:

Employment depends on **employers existing in communities**. Recovery programs can prepare individuals for work; they cannot create jobs in counties that have lost population for decades and lack the economic base to support employment growth. West Virginia's labor market challenges preceded the opioid crisis and persist independent of health improvement.

**Recovery is not linear**. Substance use disorder involves relapse, multiple treatment attempts, and ongoing support needs that employment-focused programs may not accommodate. The pipeline concept implies progression from recovery to employment to prosperity, but actual recovery trajectories are more complex.

**Coordination across agencies introduces friction**. Health to Prosperity Pipeline requires WVDOH to collaborate with WorkForce West Virginia, Department of Human Services, and other agencies with different missions, systems, and accountability structures. Interagency coordination challenges have defeated better-funded initiatives.

**The theory of change assumes jobs follow health**. Governor Morrisey has argued that improving health will increase workforce participation and economic activity. This assumes that healthy workers in rural West Virginia will find employment opportunities, that employers will locate or expand in communities with improved health profiles, and that economic revival follows from population health gains. These assumptions are plausible but unproven, and RHTP provides no mechanism to create employment independent of health improvement.

### Personal Health Accelerator Prevention Programs

**Assessment: Moderate to Significant Implementation Challenges**

Food-as-medicine, lifestyle modification, and prevention programs address root causes of West Virginia's chronic disease burden. Implementation requires behavior change that health systems cannot mandate and sustained engagement that short-term programs rarely achieve.

**Why it struggles**:

Prevention competes with **acute need**. When hospitals face closure, workforce shortages prevent access to basic care, and patients present with advanced disease, prevention programs absorb resources that could address immediate crises. The political pressure to demonstrate visible results favors treatment over prevention.

**Lifestyle programs require infrastructure that does not exist**. Food-as-medicine initiatives assume access to healthy food in communities experiencing food insecurity and operating with limited grocery options. Physical activity programs assume safe spaces for exercise in communities without sidewalks, parks, or recreation facilities.

**Outcomes manifest slowly**. Prevention investments produce measurable health improvements over years or decades, not the two-year obligation window or five-year program period. Federal scoring rewards demonstrated results; prevention's results appear after RHTP concludes.

**Community organization capacity is limited**. Prevention programs often depend on community-based organizations to deliver services, recruit participants, and sustain engagement. In rural West Virginia, CBO capacity is constrained by the same workforce and funding challenges affecting healthcare providers.

## What Gets Cut

When implementation constraints force triage, some initiatives and components face higher elimination risk than others.

### High Risk of Cuts

**HealthTech Appalachia Innovation Incubator**: The health innovation incubator represents aspirational investment in future capacity. It serves no immediate crisis, addresses no acute access barrier, and produces no short-term metrics that satisfy federal reporting requirements. When budgets tighten, innovation incubators are first to face cuts.

**Estimate**: HealthTech Appalachia has **weak survival probability** under resource constraints. The initiative may launch in reduced form or defer entirely.

**Prevention Program Scale**: Personal Health Accelerator's food-as-medicine and lifestyle components will survive at pilot scale but will not deploy at the statewide scope the application envisions. Competitive grants for community wellness initiatives will proceed with reduced budgets and fewer awards.

**Estimate**: Prevention programs have **moderate to weak survival probability** at full proposed scale. Reduced scope is likely.

### Moderate Risk of Cuts

**Workforce Retention Components**: Recruitment investments in residency expansion and loan forgiveness will proceed because they produce durable capacity. Retention investments requiring ongoing funding, such as retention bonuses and preceptor development, face pressure when recurring costs compete with one-time infrastructure investments.

**Estimate**: Recruitment and pipeline programs **survive**; retention programs **at risk**.

**Value-Based Care Transition Support**: Smart Care Catalyst's technical assistance for value-based payment transition requires sustained engagement that one-time technology grants do not. When hospitals face immediate closure risk, long-term payment model transformation becomes secondary priority.

**Estimate**: Technology grants **survive**; payment transformation support **at moderate risk**.

### Lower Risk of Cuts

**Technology Infrastructure**: Equipment procurement, telehealth deployment, and EHR upgrades produce tangible assets that demonstrate program activity. Infrastructure investments with clear deliverables are more defensible than programmatic investments requiring ongoing operations.

**Estimate**: Connected Care Grid technology components have **high survival probability**.

**Academic Partner Subawards**: WVU Medicine, Marshall, and WVSOM have the administrative capacity to absorb large awards efficiently. Concentrating funding in organizations with demonstrated capacity is simpler than distributing small awards across numerous recipients.

**Estimate**: Major academic subawards have **high survival probability**.

## Social Care Survival Assessment

### The Partial Funding Question

West Virginia's FY2026 award of **$199.5 million** exceeds the guaranteed baseline of $100 million, suggesting strong application performance. However, without access to the full application and original budget request, the percentage of requested funding received remains uncertain.

**Evidence on initiative preservation**:

Technology initiatives appear positioned for full deployment at proposed scale. Connected Care Grid proceeds with telehealth expansion, remote monitoring, and community paramedicine across defined regions.

Workforce investments survive through academic partnerships with established absorptive capacity. Residency expansion, loan forgiveness, and CHW training proceed through existing institutional channels.

Social care components embedded within other initiatives face ambiguous status. SDOH screening integrated into technology platforms survives because the technology survives. Standalone social care infrastructure does not receive protected funding.

### SDOH/HRSN Survival

| Component | Status | Survival Assessment |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| Screening requirements | Embedded in Connected Care Grid | **Survives** as data capture |
| Navigation infrastructure | Within CHW expansion | **Survives** at reduced scale |
| Social needs data capture | Via technology initiatives | **Survives** as feature |
| Closed-loop referral | Partial (findhelp integration) | **Survives** through existing platform |
| Action on identified needs | Depends on external resources | **Does not survive** within RHTP scope |

**Assessment**: West Virginia implements **screening with partial resolution capacity**. Technology platforms capture social needs data. CHWs provide navigation to community resources. Whether resources exist to address identified needs depends on community capacity and CBO infrastructure that RHTP does not fund at scale.

**WVU Medicine's findhelp integration provides existing infrastructure** that RHTP leverages rather than creates. The platform's network of 605,700+ program locations offers directory access, and patient self-referral through MyWVUChart enables resource connection. This represents embedded social care capability without dedicated social care investment.

### CHW Program Survival

| Element | Funded Status | Survival Probability |
|---------|--------------|---------------------|
| CHW training pipeline | Yes (CHERP, Marshall) | **High** |
| Employment support grants | Yes (limited) | **Moderate** |
| Medicaid reimbursement | Existing pathway | **Moderate to High** |
| Clinical supervision | Partially funded | **Moderate** |
| Statewide deployment | Implementation planning | **Moderate** |

**CHW integration depends on employer commitment**. RHTP funds training; employment absorption requires organizations to hire, supervise, and integrate CHWs into care workflows. FQHCs and managed care organizations represent likely employers, but workforce deployment scale depends on organizational decisions RHTP cannot mandate.

**Supervision remains the binding constraint**. Effective CHW deployment requires clinical oversight. West Virginia's provider shortage means supervision capacity is limited. Training workers without supervision infrastructure risks deploying workers without quality assurance.

### CIE Platform Survival

West Virginia **does not fund statewide CIE platform procurement** under RHTP. The strategy relies on expanding findhelp integration through WVU Medicine's existing deployment rather than building new technology infrastructure.

This approach has advantages and limitations:

**Advantages**: Findhelp is operational, integrated with EPIC, and accessible through patient portals. Building on existing infrastructure avoids procurement delays, implementation risk, and technology integration challenges.

**Limitations**: Findhelp coverage depends on WVU Medicine's footprint. Patients outside the WVU system may lack platform access. The resource directory depends on CBO participation in findhelp, which varies across the state.

**211 integration is not explicitly addressed** in the application. The existing statewide 211 system provides information and referral services that could complement findhelp but remains separate infrastructure.

### Sustainability Beyond 2030

Social care components face the same sustainability challenge as all RHTP investments, but with fewer plausible post-RHTP funding pathways.

| Component | Post-RHTP Funding Prospect | Assessment |
|-----------|---------------------------|------------|
| Findhelp platform | WVU Medicine operational budget | **Moderate** |
| CHW employment | Medicaid MCO payment | **Moderate** |
| SDOH screening | EHR standard workflow | **High** |
| Navigation services | Uncertain | **Low** |
| Resource directory | Vendor maintenance | **Moderate** |

**State commitment to sustaining social care integration is unclear**. West Virginia's budget constraints, evidenced by the $147 million Medicaid shortfall preceding RHTP, suggest limited state capacity to fund social care infrastructure when federal support ends.

## The 2030 Question

RHTP funding ends after five years unless Congress reauthorizes and appropriates additional resources. West Virginia must build systems that survive the funding cliff while Medicaid cuts accelerate in parallel.

### What Survives Federal Funding End

**Durable infrastructure**: Telehealth equipment, EHR systems, broadband connections, and physical facilities persist beyond the funding that created them. Technology investments produce assets with useful life exceeding the program period.

**Training pipeline capacity**: GME slots established with RHTP support generate Medicare funding that continues post-RHTP. Residency positions, once created, sustain through federal graduate medical education payment.

**CHW workforce (if employed)**: CHWs who secure employment with organizations committed to the workforce category may continue beyond RHTP if Medicaid payment pathways function.

**Findhelp integration**: WVU Medicine's platform integration becomes part of standard operations if the organization commits to maintenance.

### What Requires Ongoing Federal Support

**Loan forgiveness programs**: Awards made during RHTP satisfy existing commitments, but new awards require continued funding.

**Prevention programs**: Food-as-medicine, lifestyle modification, and community wellness initiatives depend on grant support that ends with RHTP.

**Transportation coordination**: Vehicle maintenance, driver programs, and platform operations require ongoing operational funding.

**Innovation incubator**: HealthTech Appalachia cannot self-sustain without continued investment.

### State Commitment Beyond 2030

Governor Morrisey has emphasized RHTP as transformational opportunity. His administration has not articulated state funding commitment beyond federal support. West Virginia's structural budget constraints make significant state investment unlikely without federal backing.

**The sustainability paradox**: RHTP's five-year window is insufficient for the generational change the Health to Prosperity vision describes. Breaking cycles connecting poor health, workforce nonparticipation, and economic stagnation requires sustained investment over decades. RHTP provides a starting point without ensuring continuation.

## The Medicaid Math

The fundamental tension in West Virginia's RHTP calculus is Medicaid. The numbers do not reconcile.

### Investment Versus Erosion

| Factor | Amount | Timeframe |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| RHTP investment | ~$1 billion | 5 years (FY2026-2030) |
| Projected Medicaid cuts | ~$6.6 billion | 10 years |
| Annual RHTP investment | ~$199 million | Per year |
| Annual Medicaid loss (fully implemented) | ~$900 million to $1 billion | Per year |

**RHTP represents approximately 15% of projected Medicaid losses** over the RHTP period. Annual transformation investment cannot offset annual coverage erosion approaching five times that amount.

### Hospital Financial Reality

West Virginia Hospital Association president Jim Kaufman has stated that **once all provisions in the Big Beautiful Bill are fully implemented, West Virginia hospitals will lose more than $1 billion annually**. Most critical access and rural hospitals already operate on negative margins. Additional revenue loss accelerates closure timelines regardless of transformation investment.

**Rich Sutphin of the West Virginia Rural Health Association** has been direct: "We will see hospital closures."

### Coverage Loss Implications

Projected coverage losses of **56,000 to 94,000 West Virginians** by 2034 under OBBBA provisions mean reduced patient volume, increased uncompensated care, and accelerated financial stress for providers already operating at the margin.

Work requirements alone could cut more than **$240 million per year** from state Medicaid funding. Enhanced ACA subsidies that kept marketplace insurance affordable are not extended, threatening coverage for an additional 15,000 West Virginians.

### Net Position of Rural Providers

Rural hospitals and clinics face the worst of both worlds: RHTP provides transformation funding that cannot backfill Medicaid revenue, while Medicaid cuts reduce the patient base that transformation is meant to serve.

A hospital that builds telehealth capacity with RHTP funds but loses Medicaid revenue has improved technology serving a smaller patient population with fewer resources. The improvement is real but insufficient to offset the erosion.

## Stated Priorities Versus Actual Priorities

### What the Application Says Matters

The Health to Prosperity vision positions health as the foundation of economic strength. Seven flagship initiatives address foundational barriers: access, workforce, technology, transportation, prevention, recovery, and innovation.

The application emphasizes **transformation over maintenance**, building new capabilities rather than sustaining existing systems. The framing suggests West Virginia will emerge from RHTP with transformed healthcare delivery.

### What Funding Allocations Reveal

**Technology receives substantial investment**. Connected Care Grid's estimated $45-55 million allocation (23-28% of total) reflects prioritization of infrastructure with tangible deliverables.

**Workforce investment is substantial but concentrated**. Mountain State Care Force's estimated $35-45 million flows primarily through academic partners with established capacity.

**Social care is embedded, not protected**. SDOH screening, CHW deployment, and resource navigation appear within other initiatives rather than receiving dedicated funding streams that would survive budget pressure.

**Innovation investment is modest**. HealthTech Appalachia's estimated $10-15 million (5-8% of total) represents aspirational investment vulnerable to cuts.

### The Real Theory of Change

The Health to Prosperity vision describes a virtuous cycle: improve health, increase workforce participation, drive economic revival, sustain health systems. The funding allocation suggests a more modest theory:

**Deploy technology that extends existing provider capacity**. Telehealth and remote monitoring allow scarce providers to serve more patients across wider geography.

**Accelerate workforce pipeline through proven pathways**. Residency expansion and loan forgiveness incrementally increase provider supply over the medium term.

**Build infrastructure that survives through federal payment**. GME slots and technology assets persist beyond RHTP through Medicare and operational integration.

**Accept that transformation cannot offset erosion**. The math does not work. RHTP investment of $1 billion cannot compensate for Medicaid cuts of $6.6 billion. West Virginia builds what it can with what it has while external forces determine whether the system survives.

## Lessons for Other States

### Transferable Elements

**Leverage existing academic infrastructure**. West Virginia's concentration of RHTP funding through WVU Medicine, Marshall, and WVSOM provides implementation efficiency that states with fragmented academic health sectors cannot replicate easily. States with strong academic health centers should channel substantial funding through these organizations.

**Build on existing CHW infrastructure**. WVSOM's CHERP program and Marshall's training model provide a foundation that RHTP expands rather than creates. States with established CHW training should accelerate rather than launch workforce development.

**Integrate social care through existing platforms**. WVU Medicine's findhelp integration provides SDOH capability without dedicated CIE procurement. States with health systems already using findhelp, Unite Us, or similar platforms can expand integration rather than building new infrastructure.

### Context-Specific Elements

**Geographic concentration enables focused investment**. West Virginia's 1.1 million rural residents occupy a compact geography compared to states with rural populations scattered across vast distances. Concentrated population allows concentrated investment with statewide reach.

**Uniform need simplifies prioritization**. West Virginia does not face choices between struggling regions and relatively stable regions. The entire state needs everything, which paradoxically simplifies allocation decisions.

**Political alignment enables rapid implementation**. Governor Morrisey's support for the Trump administration and federal rural health approach eliminates political friction that might delay implementation in states with adversarial relationships.

### What to Avoid

**Do not assume transformation funding offsets coverage erosion**. West Virginia's experience demonstrates that states cannot build their way out of Medicaid cuts. Transformation investment and coverage maintenance are complementary, not substitutable.

**Do not embed social care without protection**. West Virginia's approach to social care, integrating screening and navigation into other initiatives rather than establishing protected funding, creates vulnerability when budget pressure forces triage.

**Do not rely on untested theories of change**. The Health to Prosperity vision's circular logic, where health drives workforce participation drives economic revival, is plausible but unproven. States should build implementation plans that do not depend on assumptions they cannot test within the program period.

## Conclusion

West Virginia will receive approximately **$1 billion over five years** to transform healthcare for **1.1 million rural residents** in the state ranked last or near last in virtually every health outcome measure. The investment is substantial. The need is greater.

The seven flagship initiatives address real barriers: technology extends provider reach, workforce investment accelerates supply, transportation coordination improves access, and prevention programs address root causes of chronic disease burden. Implementation will proceed through capable organizations with established infrastructure. Technology will deploy. Workers will train. Programs will launch.

**The fundamental challenge is not implementation quality but structural adequacy.** RHTP provides transformation funding while OBBBA provisions extract Medicaid revenue at five times the rate of investment. Hospitals already operating on negative margins will face accelerated losses regardless of telehealth upgrades. Workforce pipeline graduates will enter employment in a system under financial stress. Prevention programs will launch while patients lose coverage.

Governor Morrisey has disputed estimates of Medicaid impact, arguing that improving health will reduce medical costs and justify smaller Medicaid investment. This optimistic view contradicts projections from CBO, Kaiser Family Foundation, and the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy. It also contradicts the assessment of Jim Kaufman of the West Virginia Hospital Association, who projects hospital losses exceeding $1 billion annually when OBBBA provisions fully implement.

**What West Virginia builds with RHTP will matter**. Technology infrastructure persists. GME slots sustain through Medicare. CHW workforce categories, once established, can continue through Medicaid payment. These investments create durable capacity that survives federal funding end if the healthcare system survives to use them.

**Whether the healthcare system survives to use them is the question RHTP cannot answer.** Fifteen hospitals face closure risk. Six face immediate closure within three years. RHTP's statutory prohibition on backfilling Medicaid revenue means transformation funding cannot address hospital financial distress directly. The Connected Care Grid can deploy telehealth equipment at a hospital that closes six months later.

The Health to Prosperity vision correctly identifies the challenge: poor health constrains workforce participation which constrains economic opportunity which constrains health system sustainability. Breaking this cycle requires sustained investment over decades. RHTP provides five years of funding that may not be renewed, while Medicaid cuts continue regardless.

**For rural West Virginians, the next five years determine whether transformation arrives before collapse.** RHTP provides the tools for transformation. OBBBA provides the timeline for collapse. The race between building and erosion defines West Virginia's rural health future.
