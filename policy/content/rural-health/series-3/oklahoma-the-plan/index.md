Part 1 established the baseline: **$223.5 million for 1.47 million rural Oklahomans** translates to approximately $152 per person annually, placing Oklahoma in the upper tier of per capita allocations. Forty-nine out of fifty in health system performance. Sixty-four percent of rural hospitals at risk. The worst breast cancer mortality in the nation. These are the conditions the Oklahoma State Department of Health must transform with resources that, while favorable by national comparison, remain modest against the scale of dysfunction.

Oklahoma responded with a **six-initiative strategy** organizing transformation around tribal health integration, technology deployment, workforce development, and regional collaboration. The application leveraged what no other state possesses: 39 federally recognized tribes operating extensive health systems that serve both tribal citizens and, through various coordination arrangements, broader rural populations.

The central premise: Oklahoma's unique tribal health infrastructure creates **integration opportunities that can accelerate transformation** beyond what standalone state efforts achieve. Tribal systems bring workforce, facilities, community trust, and operational capacity that decades of state investment failed to build. RHTP funding can catalyze coordination rather than construct infrastructure from scratch.

Whether this premise holds will determine if Oklahoma's favorable funding position translates to improved outcomes or merely well-documented activity.

## Governance Structure

### Lead Agency and Implementation Partners

The **Oklahoma State Department of Health (OSDH)** serves as lead agency and cooperative agreement holder. Commissioner Heather Maughan bears ultimate responsibility for program implementation, reporting, and compliance with CMS requirements.

Implementation involves multi-agency coordination reflecting the reality that rural health transformation touches domains beyond OSDH's direct authority:

| Agency | Function |
|--------|----------|
| **Oklahoma Health Care Authority (OHCA)** | Medicaid integration, value-based care transition, SoonerSelect alignment |
| **Department of Human Services (DHS)** | Social service coordination, transportation, community support |
| **Oklahoma Workforce Commission** | Training programs, recruitment initiatives |
| **Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services (DMH)** | Behavioral health integration, CCBHC expansion |
| **Office of Broadband Technology** | Digital infrastructure supporting telehealth expansion |

The governance structure intentionally positions OSDH as coordinator rather than sole implementer. Rural health transformation requires Medicaid payment systems, behavioral health capacity, workforce training, and technology infrastructure that no single agency controls. OSDH must align agencies with different statutory missions, budget processes, and political leadership.

### Tribal Consultation and Coordination

Oklahoma's application emerged from **genuine tribal consultation** with more than 60 tribal representatives participating in planning discussions. This consultation was not performative compliance with federal requirements. Tribal health systems in Oklahoma operate at scale sufficient to influence program design, and tribal representatives possessed technical expertise and operational knowledge that shaped initiative structure.

The coordination structure creates joint planning mechanisms:

- **Joint planning committees** including tribal and state health officials
- **Service coordination protocols** defining referral pathways between systems
- **Data sharing agreements** bridging IHS, tribal, and state health information systems
- **Workforce development partnerships** serving both tribal and general rural populations
- **Cultural competency requirements** ensuring program design reflects tribal input

The practical challenge: tribal nations are sovereign governments, not state agencies or contractors. Coordination requires government-to-government relationships with 39 distinct tribal governments, each with its own priorities, capacity, and relationships with federal agencies. OSDH cannot direct tribal participation; it can only create frameworks that make participation beneficial for tribal health systems.

## Strategic Framework

### Theory of Change

Oklahoma's theory of change assumes that **bringing care closer to home through technology, transportation, and workforce development** will improve outcomes while regional collaboration and value-based payment create sustainability. The state explicitly designed initiatives with post-2030 funding sources in mind: billable services, provider-assumed costs, ongoing government funding, private funding, and one-time capital investments that yield durable infrastructure.

The logic model:

1. **Tribal integration accelerates transformation.** Tribal health systems provide workforce, facilities, and community relationships that decades of state effort failed to build. RHTP catalyzes coordination rather than constructing parallel infrastructure.

2. **Technology extends capacity faster than workforce alone.** Telehealth, remote monitoring, and AI-assisted triage expand provider reach while workforce pipelines produce additional practitioners over longer horizons.

3. **Regional collaboration achieves economies unavailable to isolated facilities.** Shared purchasing, coordinated staffing, and referral networks improve efficiency for facilities that cannot achieve scale individually.

4. **Value-based payment creates sustainability incentives.** Transition from fee-for-service to outcomes-based reimbursement aligns provider incentives with population health improvement.

5. **Upstream prevention reduces chronic disease burden.** Investment in wellness programming, chronic disease management, and behavioral health integration addresses Oklahoma's leading causes of poor outcomes.

### Theory Vulnerabilities

The theory assumes tribal health systems will coordinate with state programs despite historical tensions between tribal governments and state authority. It assumes technology deployment reaches populations with connectivity, which remains incomplete in significant portions of rural Oklahoma. It assumes workforce pipelines produce practitioners who stay in Oklahoma rather than migrating to higher-paying markets. Each assumption could fail.

## Six RHTP Initiatives

Oklahoma organizes transformation around six interconnected initiatives addressing access, prevention, workforce, collaboration, payment reform, and technology infrastructure.

### Initiative 1: Innovating the Care Model

**Focus**: Telehealth expansion, transportation support, expanded care teams, local infrastructure investment.

This initiative directly addresses access barriers by bringing services to communities rather than requiring travel. Mobile wellness units deliver preventive services in communities lacking fixed facilities. Virtual specialist consultations connect rural patients with cardiology, dermatology, psychiatry, and other specialties that rural communities cannot support through permanent staffing. Ride scheduling tools and local driver programs address transportation as the barrier it actually is for populations without reliable vehicles.

**Key components**:
- Mobile wellness units serving isolated communities
- Telehealth platform deployment across rural facilities
- Virtual specialist consultation networks
- Transportation coordination and ride scheduling
- Expanded care team models integrating CHWs, pharmacists, and behavioral health

**Implementation timeline**: Mobile units and telehealth platforms deploy Year 1. Specialist consultation networks establish Year 2. Full expansion through Year 5.

### Initiative 2: Moving Upstream

**Focus**: Chronic disease prevention and management, community-led wellness programs.

Oklahoma's burden of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease demands upstream intervention. The state's five leading health improvement priorities all involve chronic conditions that prevention and management programs can address. Programs emphasize physical fitness, nutrition, and evidence-based chronic disease management aligned with **Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) priorities**.

**Key components**:
- Diabetes Prevention Program expansion
- Community fitness and wellness programming
- Nutrition education and food access initiatives
- Chronic disease self-management support
- School and workplace wellness integration

**MAHA alignment**: Initiative 2 explicitly brands around federal wellness priorities, positioning Oklahoma for favorable scoring in annual re-evaluation. Lifestyle intervention emphasis matches administration priorities while addressing Oklahoma's genuine chronic disease burden.

### Initiative 3: Growing the Next Generation of Rural Talent

**Focus**: "Grow your own" workforce initiatives, training placements, recruitment and retention programs.

Building on models like the **OSU-COM Cherokee Nation Campus** that demonstrates 70% in-state residency placement, Oklahoma aims to train local students who will practice locally. Pipeline development spans community health workers through physicians, recognizing that different workforce categories have different training timelines and retention dynamics.

**Key components**:
- CHW training and certification expansion
- Clinical training placements in rural and tribal settings
- Loan repayment and scholarship programs
- Recruitment partnerships with training institutions
- Retention support for practicing rural providers

**Timeline reality**: Physician training produces practitioners in 2032 at earliest. Nurse practitioner and PA programs take three to four years. CHW training produces workers within twelve to eighteen months. Initiative 3 front-loads CHW deployment while building longer-term pipelines.

### Initiative 4: Facilitating Regional Collaboration

**Focus**: Shared operations, technology, coordinated care across providers.

Rural facilities working together on purchasing, staffing, and service coordination can achieve efficiencies that isolated operations cannot. Regional networks create referral pathways and specialist access while reducing duplication of administrative functions.

**Key components**:
- Regional health network development
- Shared purchasing and supply chain coordination
- Coordinated staffing pools for coverage
- Referral pathway formalization
- Administrative service consolidation

**Tribal integration point**: Regional collaboration necessarily involves tribal facilities that serve as primary care sources in many rural areas. Network development must bridge tribal and non-tribal systems rather than creating parallel coordination structures.

### Initiative 5: Shifting to Value

**Focus**: Technical assistance for value-based care transition, infrastructure development, quality incentive programs.

Oklahoma's **SoonerSelect managed care transition** in 2024 created foundation for value-based payment. RHTP accelerates rural provider readiness for outcomes-based reimbursement rather than building from scratch. Technical assistance helps rural providers understand quality reporting requirements, manage population health data, and demonstrate outcomes that generate value-based payment.

**Key components**:
- Value-based care technical assistance
- Quality reporting infrastructure
- Population health management tools
- Performance incentive program design
- Managed care organization coordination

**SoonerSelect alignment**: The $700 million in directed payments flowing through SoonerSelect creates financial stakes for value-based performance. RHTP investment positions rural providers to succeed under payment models that will persist beyond federal funding.

### Initiative 6: Building Health Data Utility

**Focus**: EHR upgrades, interoperability, data sharing, analytics platforms.

Connected health records reduce duplicate testing, improve care coordination, and enable population health management. This digital backbone underlies all other initiatives. Providers cannot coordinate care without shared information. Quality cannot be measured without data infrastructure. Value-based payment requires outcomes tracking that fragmented systems cannot support.

**Key components**:
- EHR upgrade and standardization support
- Health information exchange enhancement
- Interoperability across tribal and non-tribal systems
- Analytics platforms for population health management
- Patient data access and portal integration

**IHS PATH alignment**: The federal **IHS PATH EHR modernization** pilots at Lawton Indian Hospital in 2026. Aligning RHTP health data utility investments with PATH implementation could accelerate interoperability across the tribal/non-tribal divide, creating connected systems that neither federal nor state investment could achieve independently.

### Tribal Health Integration

Oklahoma's RHTP represents the **most significant tribal health integration opportunity** in the program nationally. Coordination with 39 tribes and extensive IHS/tribal facility infrastructure creates pathways unavailable elsewhere:

**Joint planning**: Tribal consultation with more than 60 representatives shaped application design, not merely validated state-developed plans.

**Service coordination**: Referral networks connecting tribal and non-tribal facilities create care pathways that leverage tribal capacity for populations served by both systems.

**Workforce sharing**: Training programs serving both tribal and general rural populations avoid duplication while building workforce serving multiple systems.

**Technology alignment**: Data sharing infrastructure bridging IHS and state systems enables care coordination that fragmented systems prevent.

**Cultural competency**: Programs designed with tribal input ensure appropriate care delivery for populations with distinct health beliefs and practices.

## Social Care Integration

### SDOH/HRSN Framework

Oklahoma's RHTP addresses social determinants through multiple channels, though funding levels vary by component:

| Component | Included in Plan | Estimated Funding | Implementation Approach | Likely Funded? |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|------------------------|----------------|
| SDOH Screening | Yes | Embedded in care model | Integrated with SoonerSelect | Yes |
| Transportation | Yes | $15-25M | Ride scheduling, local driver programs | Yes |
| CHW Programs | Yes | $10-15M | Certification expansion, deployment | Yes |
| Care Coordination | Yes | Embedded in initiatives | Regional networks, referral systems | Yes |
| Food/Nutrition | Yes | $5-10M | Food-as-medicine, MAHA alignment | At Risk |
| CIE Platform | Limited | TBD | Leveraging existing infrastructure | At Risk |

Oklahoma's **transportation investments** directly address a critical barrier: many rural residents cannot access care without ride assistance. The state's mobile wellness units bring care to communities rather than requiring travel. These approaches acknowledge that technology solutions alone cannot serve populations lacking vehicles and internet access.

### Community Health Worker Expansion

OSDH maintains CHW licensing and certification infrastructure that RHTP can scale. Training programs, supervision structures, and reimbursement pathways exist; funding accelerates deployment. The tribal health system's extensive use of **community health representatives** provides models for non-tribal adaptation.

**CHW expansion components**:
- Training program capacity increase
- Certification pathway streamlining
- Supervision infrastructure support
- Reimbursement advocacy with managed care organizations
- Deployment in highest-need communities

CHWs produce within twelve to eighteen months of training initiation. Unlike physician pipelines requiring decade-long investment, CHW programs yield workers within RHTP's window who can then contribute to transformation during the program period.

## Critical Implementation Questions

### Explicit Assumptions

Oklahoma's plan explicitly assumes:

1. **Tribal health systems will coordinate genuinely.** Integration requires 39 sovereign governments choosing to participate in frameworks Oklahoma designs. Tribal governments have their own priorities, capacities, and relationships with federal agencies.

2. **Technology reaches underserved populations.** Telehealth and data infrastructure serve communities with connectivity. Significant portions of rural Oklahoma lack broadband meeting minimum federal standards.

3. **Value-based payment produces sustainability.** Transition from fee-for-service to outcomes-based reimbursement creates incentives that persist beyond federal funding.

4. **Workforce pipelines retain graduates in Oklahoma.** Training programs produce practitioners who stay rather than migrating to higher-paying markets in Dallas, Houston, or Kansas City.

### Implicit Assumptions

The plan implicitly assumes:

1. **Medicaid cuts do not overwhelm transformation investment.** Projected $8.7 billion in Medicaid losses over the decade could offset RHTP's $1.12 billion five-year investment.

2. **Hospital closure trajectory stabilizes.** Twenty-two facilities at immediate closure risk cannot all survive through transformation investment that RHTP prohibits from direct operating support.

3. **Mental health treatment gaps prove addressable.** Eighty to ninety-five percent untreated rates may reflect capacity constraints that workforce development cannot resolve within program timelines.

4. **Constitutional Medicaid protection provides sufficient stability.** Federal cuts may erode coverage despite state constitutional protection of expansion.

### Dependencies on External Factors

| Factor | Dependency Level | Risk |
|--------|-----------------|------|
| Tribal government participation | High | Sovereignty limits Oklahoma's ability to require coordination |
| Broadband buildout | High | Technology initiatives fail without connectivity |
| Medicaid cut magnitude | High | Large cuts offset transformation investment |
| IHS PATH implementation | Moderate | Delayed PATH limits interoperability opportunity |
| State budget | Moderate | Matching or sustainability funding uncertain |

## Conclusion

Oklahoma proposes to transform rural healthcare for 1.47 million residents through **six interconnected initiatives** leveraging what no other state possesses: 39 federally recognized tribes operating extensive health systems that can coordinate with state transformation efforts.

The plan is rational within its constraints. Tribal integration offers genuine acceleration opportunity. Technology extends capacity while workforce pipelines develop. Regional collaboration achieves efficiencies unavailable to isolated facilities. Value-based payment creates sustainability incentives. MAHA-aligned wellness programming positions Oklahoma for continued federal support.

The plan's limitations are equally clear. Tribal coordination requires sovereign government participation Oklahoma cannot compel. Technology serves connected populations while bypassing those without broadband. Workforce pipelines produce providers after RHTP ends. Hospital stabilization operates within prohibited parameters that prevent direct revenue support.

**Part 3 will assess** which initiatives succeed, which struggle against implementation constraints, what gets cut when resources fall short, and whether Oklahoma's tribal integration opportunity produces the acceleration the theory of change assumes. The state's unique assets meet its near-worst starting position in America's largest experiment in rural health transformation.
