Arkansas received $208.8 million in fiscal year 2026, the first installment of approximately $1 billion over five years to transform rural healthcare through four interconnected initiatives. The state's RHTP application, submitted by Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders through the Department of Finance and Administration, concentrates $393 million on care delivery integration through Clinically Integrated Networks, $266.75 million on technology infrastructure and telehealth, $161.5 million on workforce development, and $150.5 million on prevention. The strategic architecture places **regional coordination as the centerpiece bet**, wagering that provider networks can achieve efficiency gains and care improvements that fragmented systems cannot deliver while $911 billion in simultaneous Medicaid cuts proceed nationally.

The paradox driving Arkansas's approach emerged clearly in Part 1 of this analysis. Arkansas maintains the nation's highest rural hospital vulnerability rate at 50 percent, yet only one rural hospital has closed since Medicaid expansion in 2014. The policy protection that preserved these hospitals now faces systematic erosion through federal funding reductions beginning in 2029. Arkansas is not using transformation funding to rebuild collapsed infrastructure. Arkansas is using transformation funding to construct systems capable of surviving when current protections disappear. This strategic positioning shapes every component of the four-initiative framework, from prevention programs embedded in community institutions to workforce pipelines designed for retention in resource-constrained environments.

PACT (Promoting Access Coordination and Transformation) commands the largest allocation at $393 million over five years, reflecting Arkansas's judgment that **structural transformation of care delivery offers higher returns than isolated programmatic interventions**. The initiative channels $110 million specifically into Clinically Integrated Network development, creating regional provider organizations that enable data sharing, care coordination, and resource alignment across hospitals, clinics, and specialty providers within defined geographic areas. These networks preserve institutional autonomy while building collective capacity that individual facilities cannot achieve alone. A rural hospital remains independently operated but gains access to shared electronic health records, coordinated specialty referrals, joint purchasing power, and standardized clinical protocols for common conditions.

The CIN model draws on successful examples from other states where regional networks improved care coordination and reduced unnecessary utilization, but Arkansas faces the challenge that networks require trust among providers who historically competed for patients and resources. Rural hospitals in the same region view each other as competitors rather than partners. Physicians resist data sharing that exposes practice patterns to scrutiny. Administrators fear losing autonomy to regional governance structures. Building functional networks typically requires years of relationship development. Arkansas attempts to accelerate this timeline with significant funding, but money alone does not create trust. The state will need skilled facilitators, governance frameworks that protect member interests, and early wins that demonstrate network value to skeptical participants.

PACT allocates an additional $125 million for specialty service integration, addressing the core access problem that rural residents cannot see specialists without traveling hours to regional centers. Rural hospitals cannot employ full-time cardiologists, oncologists, neurologists, or behavioral health specialists. The initiative creates regional specialty networks where specialists rotate among facilities, provide telehealth consultations, and develop referral relationships with primary care providers. Trauma-ready services receive specific attention, with funding for training, equipment, and protocols to improve emergency response at rural facilities even when full trauma designation remains unattainable.

The $125 million for hospital acquisitions, partnerships, and facility upgrades enables strategic consolidation and investment in physical infrastructure. Some vulnerable hospitals may be acquired by larger systems that provide management expertise and capital resources. Others may form partnerships that preserve local governance while accessing shared services. Facility modernization addresses aging buildings, outdated equipment, and inadequate technology that prevent rural hospitals from providing services patients need and that generate sustainable revenue. The allocation represents Arkansas's recognition that **transformation requires both organizational restructuring and capital investment in the built environment**.

THRIVE (Telehealth Health Monitoring and Response Innovation for Vital Expansion) invests $266.75 million in the digital backbone that enables other initiatives to function. The University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences operates UAMS e-Link, one of the nation's largest telehealth networks with over 25 years of experience and connections to more than 400 healthcare and education sites across Arkansas. The UAMS Institute for Digital Health and Innovation provides training, technical support, and program development for organizations implementing telehealth services. RHTP funding expands existing infrastructure rather than building from scratch, leveraging established capacity to accelerate deployment.

The initiative allocates $105 million for medical equipment and emergency medical services modernization, addressing aging infrastructure across rural ambulance services and hospitals. Many rural EMS agencies operate outdated vehicles with limited equipment. Cardiac monitors, defibrillators, ventilators, and communication systems require replacement to enable effective emergency response. Hospital equipment investments support diagnostic capabilities that keep patients local rather than requiring transfer to regional centers for basic imaging and laboratory services.

Remote patient monitoring receives $91.75 million to enable chronic disease management outside clinical settings. Patients with diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, and other conditions use connected devices to track vital signs and transmit data to care teams. Nurses monitor dashboards and intervene when readings indicate problems, catching deterioration before symptoms escalate to emergency levels. This approach extends the reach of limited clinical staff, allowing one nurse to monitor dozens of patients rather than seeing them individually in clinic visits. The efficiency gain is essential in Arkansas, where **nursing shortages fundamentally limit care delivery capacity regardless of facility availability**.

RISE (Recruitment Innovation Skills and Education for Arkansas) allocates $161.5 million to workforce development, acknowledging that Arkansas cannot transform care delivery without providers to deliver care. The initiative channels $70.25 million into residency program expansion and scholarships, growing graduate medical education capacity in family medicine, internal medicine, psychiatry, and specialties critical for rural practice. Research consistently shows physicians who complete residency in a state are more likely to practice there long-term, though "more likely" does not mean "certain." RISE invests in pipeline development from medical school through residency to rural practice, with scholarships tied to service commitments in underserved areas.

The $67 million for recruitment and retention incentives acknowledges that training providers is insufficient if they leave Arkansas after completing education. Rural practice has high turnover because isolation, limited professional opportunities, and quality-of-life concerns drive providers to urban settings. Physicians in rural areas lack colleagues for consultation, have limited access to continuing education, and face professional isolation unknown to urban practitioners. Spouses struggle to find employment. Children have limited educational opportunities. These factors drive attrition regardless of compensation levels. RISE invests in preceptor development to improve training experiences, mentorship programs supporting early-career providers through challenging initial years, and practice environment improvements including technology, staffing, and facility upgrades that make rural positions more attractive relative to urban alternatives.

Career advancement programs receive $16.3 million to support nurses, medical assistants, lab technicians, radiology technicians, and other professionals staffing rural facilities. Many rural workers want to advance careers but lack access to education programs available in urban areas. "Earn While You Learn" programs pay clinical staff to pursue additional credentials while continuing employment. A licensed practical nurse earns a registered nursing degree. A medical assistant completes nursing prerequisites. A registered nurse advances to nurse practitioner. These programs retain workers who might otherwise leave for urban education opportunities and then not return.

HEART (Healthy Eating, Active Recreation, and Transformation) positions prevention as foundational but allocates the smallest share at $150.5 million over five years. The initiative targets nutrition, physical activity, and chronic disease management through community-based programs rather than clinical services. Arkansas became the first state to ban SNAP purchases of soft drinks and candy in 2025, a policy adopted explicitly to improve RHTP scoring under Make America Healthy Again priorities. HEART extends this emphasis through school-based clinics, mobile care units, nutrition education, cooking classes, food access initiatives, and partnerships with local food producers.

The $10 million for school-based health infrastructure brings preventive services directly to students in rural communities where transportation barriers limit clinic access. Arkansas already implemented Senate Bill 59 requiring free breakfast for all students and bell-to-bell cell phone bans intended to increase physical activity during school hours. HEART integrates programs through schools, faith-based organizations, community centers, and healthcare facilities, recognizing that **chronic disease prevention requires lifestyle changes occurring outside clinical settings where people actually live their lives**.

The governance structure concentrates authority in the executive branch rather than distributing implementation across health-specific agencies. Andy Babbitt, currently state comptroller and Department of Finance and Administration deputy director, serves as project director with an annual salary of $500,000 over the five-year program period. Administrative costs total $28.2 million for contracted services, personnel, and fringe benefits. This structure reflects Governor Sanders's desire to maintain direct control over RHTP priorities and implementation decisions while placing accountability squarely with the governor's office.

The centralized approach may facilitate coordination across initiatives that must function as integrated components rather than parallel programs. Prevention programs under HEART connect to care delivery through PACT's Clinically Integrated Networks, with school-based clinics referring students to network member providers for follow-up care.
