Mississippi's RHTP application requests approximately **$500 million to $1 billion over five years** to transform rural health through six interconnected initiatives. Governor Tate Reeves unveiled the state's plan on November 4, 2025, one day before the federal submission deadline, describing a comprehensive strategy focused on regional integration, workforce development, technology modernization, and care gap closure.

Part 1 documented the crisis: 36 rural hospitals at risk of closure (54%), 23 at immediate closure risk, health outcomes ranking last nationally, and the absence of Medicaid expansion that distinguishes Mississippi from states with similar demographics but different policy choices. The RHTP funding arrives as Medicaid cuts threaten to extract more from Mississippi healthcare than transformation investment provides.

The state received **$205,907,220 for fiscal year 2026**, above the national average and sixth nationally in total allocation. Five-year funding depends on continued appropriations and compliance with program requirements. Mississippi's stated goal is ambitious: **by 2031, every rural Mississippian will have reliable access to high-quality healthcare services, both in-person and through telehealth**.

This analysis examines what Mississippi proposes to build, how the six initiatives connect, who implements the plan, and what assumptions must hold for the strategy to succeed.

## The Strategic Framework

Mississippi's RHTP plan organizes around six named initiatives, each with distinct focus areas but designed to function as integrated components of a comprehensive transformation strategy:

1. **Building Rural Infrastructure for Delivery, Growth and Efficiency (BRIDGE)**: Strengthening healthcare infrastructure, improving specialty access, closing care gaps, and supporting innovative pilot programs
2. **Statewide Rural Health Assessment**: Third-party comprehensive assessment of rural healthcare needs today and projected ten years forward
3. **Coordinated Regional Integrated Systems (CRIS)**: Transforming rural healthcare delivery by creating connected, data-driven networks of emergency, clinical, and community-based services
4. **Workforce Expansion Initiative**: Strengthening healthcare workforce through recruitment, retention, training, and career pathway development
5. **Health Technology Advancement and Modernization Initiative**: Modernizing rural healthcare systems by strengthening digital infrastructure for high-quality, coordinated, and secure care
6. **Telehealth Adoption and Provider Support Initiative**: Increasing virtual care access, supporting providers in adopting telehealth, and exploring innovative care models

The **Office of the Governor** leads oversight and coordination of the program. The **Mississippi Department of Health**, which houses the State Office of Rural Health, and the **Mississippi Division of Medicaid**, a division of the governor's office, serve as implementing partners. This governance structure concentrates authority in the executive branch rather than distributing implementation across independent health-specific agencies.

The plan's **theory of change** rests on several propositions:

1. Regional coordination through integrated systems can improve care quality and efficiency beyond what fragmented facilities achieve independently
2. Workforce pipelines must be grown internally through training, retention incentives, and career pathway development
3. Technology infrastructure enables care access in areas where physical infrastructure cannot be sustained
4. Comprehensive assessment establishes an evidence base for strategic decisions and resource allocation
5. Care gap closure through targeted pilots and specialty access programs addresses specific deficiencies
6. Transformation can create systems durable enough to survive beyond 2030 when RHTP funding ends

These propositions are plausible but unproven at scale in Mississippi's context. The state is betting that five years of intensive investment can change trajectories that decades of prior policy failed to alter.

## Program Allocation Table

**Note**: Mississippi did not release its full RHTP application publicly. Budget allocations below are estimated based on governor's office announcements, initiative descriptions, and comparison with similar states' documented allocations. Actual allocations may differ.

| Initiative | Focus Area | Estimated Budget | Lead Organization | Key Deliverables |
|------------|------------|------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| BRIDGE | Infrastructure, Specialty Access, Pilot Programs | $80-100M | MS Department of Health, Hospital Partners | Care gap closure, maternal health pilots, autism services, mobile clinics |
| Statewide Assessment | Needs Assessment | $5-10M | Third-party contractor (TBD) | Comprehensive 10-year rural health needs analysis |
| CRIS | Regional Networks, Care Coordination | $100-120M | Regional Health Districts, Hospital Associations | Data-driven networks linking EMS, hospitals, primary care, social services |
| Workforce Expansion | Recruitment, Retention, Training | $80-100M | UMMC, Community Colleges, Hospital Association | Residency expansion, scholarships, retention awards, preceptor development |
| Technology Advancement | Digital Infrastructure, Cybersecurity | $60-80M | MS Department of Health, Technology Partners | Health IT modernization, EHR interoperability, cybersecurity enhancement |
| Telehealth Adoption | Virtual Care, Remote Monitoring | $60-80M | UMMC Telehealth, Regional Hubs | Telehealth platforms, provider training, remote patient monitoring |
| Administration | Program Management | $20-30M | Office of Governor, DFA | Project management, compliance, reporting, oversight |
| **Total (Estimated)** | | **~$500M-$600M (5-year)** | | |

The budget allocations reveal Mississippi's priorities. **CRIS commands the largest estimated share**, reflecting emphasis on regional coordination as the strategic centerpiece. **BRIDGE and Workforce Expansion receive comparable allocations**, acknowledging that infrastructure and workforce are equally foundational. **Technology and Telehealth investments** recognize that digital infrastructure enables other initiatives to function.

## Initiative 1: BRIDGE

**Building Rural Infrastructure for Delivery, Growth and Efficiency**

**Estimated Budget**: $80-100 million over five years

BRIDGE addresses the physical and programmatic infrastructure deficits that limit rural healthcare delivery. The initiative focuses on **improving access to specialized care, closing care gaps, and supporting innovative pilot programs** that enhance healthcare delivery and improve outcomes.

**Core Components**:

**Specialty Access Expansion**: Rural Mississippians travel hours for specialty care that urban residents access locally. BRIDGE funds partnerships between rural hospitals and specialty providers to extend services into underserved areas. Cardiology, oncology, orthopedics, and behavioral health are priority specialties where rural access is most limited.

**Maternal Health Pilots**: Given Mississippi's status as having the **highest maternal mortality rate nationally**, BRIDGE includes dedicated pilot programs for pregnant women in rural areas. Mobile prenatal clinics, telehealth consultations with maternal-fetal medicine specialists, and community-based doula programs aim to improve access and outcomes in maternity care deserts.

**Autism Spectrum Disorder Services**: Mississippi's rural areas lack autism diagnostic and treatment services. Families travel to Jackson or out of state for assessments and therapy. BRIDGE pilots extend autism services into rural communities through a combination of traveling clinicians, telehealth, and training for local providers.

**Mobile Health Units**: Building on successful models elsewhere, Mississippi deploys mobile clinics to bring primary care, dental care, and preventive services to communities without fixed facilities. Mobile units serve as bridges during transformation, providing care while permanent infrastructure develops.

**Physical Infrastructure Improvement**: Rural hospitals require facility upgrades to maintain accreditation, improve patient safety, and attract workforce. BRIDGE supports capital improvements that hospitals cannot fund independently, though federal rules prohibit direct financial assistance to hospitals for operating expenses.

**Implementation Approach**: BRIDGE programs flow through partnerships with the **Mississippi Hospital Association**, individual rural hospitals, the **Mississippi Primary Health Care Association** representing FQHCs, and specialty provider networks anchored by the **University of Mississippi Medical Center**. Subawards distribute funding to implementing organizations rather than concentrating resources in state agencies.

**Subawardees** (Anticipated):

| Organization | Role | Estimated Value |
|--------------|------|-----------------|
| Mississippi Hospital Association | Technical assistance, network coordination | $10-15M |
| University of Mississippi Medical Center | Specialty access hub, telespecialty services | $15-25M |
| Mississippi Primary Health Care Association | FQHC coordination, community health | $5-10M |
| Delta Health System | Regional pilot implementation | $5-10M |
| Individual CAHs and rural hospitals | Direct service delivery | Distributed |

**Timeline**: Specialty access partnerships launch in year one. Mobile health units deploy across priority regions by year two. Maternal health and autism pilots begin in year one with expansion in years two and three based on outcomes.

## Initiative 2: Statewide Rural Health Assessment

**Estimated Budget**: $5-10 million

Mississippi will engage a **third-party contractor** to conduct a comprehensive statewide assessment of rural healthcare needs, both current and projected ten years forward. Governor Reeves did not specify how the contractor would be selected.

**Assessment Scope**:

- Current inventory of rural health infrastructure (hospitals, clinics, providers, services)
- Population health needs by region, demographics, and disease burden
- Workforce supply and demand analysis
- Transportation and access barriers
- Technology infrastructure gaps
- Social determinants of health affecting rural populations
- Ten-year projections for population, health needs, and infrastructure requirements
- Recommendations for strategic investment priorities

**Purpose**: The assessment provides an evidence base for strategic decisions during the RHTP implementation period. Rather than relying on existing data or assumptions, Mississippi will generate new analysis specific to RHTP planning needs.

**Concerns**: The assessment timeline may conflict with implementation urgency. If comprehensive analysis takes 12-18 months to complete, RHTP initiatives must proceed based on existing knowledge while assessment results remain pending. The value of assessment depends on whether findings inform midcourse corrections or merely document what implementation already addressed.

**Implementation**: Procurement for the third-party assessment contract begins in early 2026. The Request for Proposals (RFP) process, contractor selection, and assessment execution will extend through year two. Final reports are anticipated in late 2027 or early 2028.

## Initiative 3: Coordinated Regional Integrated Systems (CRIS)

**Estimated Budget**: $100-120 million over five years

CRIS represents Mississippi's strategic centerpiece: **transforming rural healthcare delivery by creating connected, data-driven networks of emergency, clinical, and community-based services**. The initiative aims to replace fragmentation with coordination, enabling regional optimization of resources that individual facilities cannot achieve independently.

**Regional Health Districts**

Mississippi's approach mirrors successful models in other states where **hub-and-spoke networks** link rural facilities to regional centers. Under CRIS, the state creates **health districts** that integrate:

- Emergency Medical Services (EMS)
- Rural hospitals (CAHs and PPS facilities)
- Primary care clinics (RHCs and FQHCs)
- Specialty referral networks
- Public health departments
- Social services and community organizations

Each district develops governance structures, shared protocols, and data infrastructure enabling coordinated care across institutional boundaries. A patient entering the system at any point can be connected to appropriate services throughout the network.

**Data-Driven Coordination**

CRIS invests in **data infrastructure** that enables real-time coordination across facilities. This includes:

- Regional health information exchanges
- Shared care coordination platforms
- Population health analytics
- Referral management systems
- Quality monitoring dashboards

Data infrastructure is foundational. Without shared information systems, coordination depends on phone calls, faxes, and personal relationships. CRIS builds technical capacity for systematic rather than ad hoc collaboration.

**EMS Integration**

Emergency medical services in Mississippi are largely county-based, with varying capabilities, equipment, and protocols. CRIS standardizes and coordinates EMS across regional networks, ensuring that ambulances can deliver patients to appropriate facilities and that transfer protocols optimize outcomes rather than defaulting to nearest geography.

EMS integration includes equipment modernization, personnel training, communication system upgrades, and protocol standardization. Regional medical direction ensures consistent clinical practice across EMS agencies.

**Community-Based Services**

CRIS extends beyond clinical facilities to incorporate community organizations, social services, and public health programs. Care coordination addresses social determinants of health by connecting patients to food assistance, housing support, transportation, and other resources that affect health outcomes.

**Implementation Challenges**

Regional coordination requires **trust** among providers who have historically competed or operated independently. A hospital that fears losing patients to a regional competitor may resist data sharing. A physician practice that values autonomy may reject standardized protocols. An administrator who protects institutional prerogatives may undermine regional governance.

Mississippi's rural hospitals face existential financial pressure, which can either motivate collaboration (survival through partnership) or intensify competition (zero-sum thinking about limited resources). CRIS success depends on aligning incentives so that regional coordination benefits individual participants.

**Key Partners**:

| Organization | CRIS Role |
|--------------|-----------|
| Mississippi Hospital Association | Network coordination, technical assistance |
| Regional Health Districts (to be formed) | Governance, care coordination |
| Delta Health Alliance | Community integration, Delta region coordination |
| MS Department of Health | Public health integration, oversight |
| County EMS Agencies | Emergency services coordination |

## Initiative 4: Workforce Expansion

**Estimated Budget**: $80-100 million over five years

The Workforce Expansion Initiative addresses Mississippi's critical healthcare workforce shortages through **recruitment, retention, training, and career pathway development** for all healthcare professionals.

**Recruitment Programs**

Mississippi cannot rely on external recruitment to meet workforce needs. National shortages limit supply, and Mississippi's compensation levels and practice conditions do not attract providers from other states. Workforce Expansion focuses on **growing Mississippi's own workforce** through:

- Medical school and residency expansion at the **University of Mississippi Medical Center**
- Nursing and allied health program expansion at community colleges statewide
- Scholarships and loan repayment programs tied to rural service commitments
- Recruitment incentives including sign-on bonuses and relocation assistance

**Retention Programs**

Recruiting providers to rural areas accomplishes little if they leave after two years. Retention programs include:

- **Retention awards** for providers who complete multi-year rural service commitments
- **Career advancement support** enabling incumbent workers to pursue additional credentials while working
- **Preceptor development** creating positive learning environments for trainees
- **Earn While You Learn programs** paying clinical staff to pursue degrees and certifications
- **Leadership development** preparing rural healthcare administrators for management roles

**Training Pipeline Development**

Long-term workforce sustainability requires pipelines that begin before college. Workforce Expansion includes:

- High school health career academies exposing students to healthcare professions
- Community college partnerships expanding nursing and allied health capacity
- Clinical training sites in rural hospitals connecting students to rural practice
- Simulation and technology-enhanced training extending educational capacity

**Key Partners**:

| Organization | Workforce Role | Estimated Investment |
|--------------|---------------|---------------------|
| University of Mississippi Medical Center | Residency expansion, medical education | $30-40M |
| Mississippi Community College System | Nursing and allied health training | $15-25M |
| Mississippi Hospital Association | Clinical training coordination, workforce initiatives | $10-15M |
| Individual Rural Hospitals | Training sites, preceptor programs | Distributed |

**Priority Professions**:

- Primary care physicians (family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics)
- Psychiatrists and behavioral health providers
- OB-GYN and maternal health specialists
- Emergency medicine physicians
- Nurses (RN, LPN, nurse practitioners)
- Physician assistants
- Respiratory therapists
- Medical laboratory technicians
- Emergency medical technicians and paramedics

## Initiative 5: Health Technology Advancement and Modernization

**Estimated Budget**: $60-80 million over five years

The Technology Advancement Initiative **modernizes rural healthcare systems by strengthening the digital backbone** that supports high-quality, coordinated, and secure care.

**Electronic Health Record Modernization**

Rural hospitals and clinics operate with varying electronic health record (EHR) systems, many outdated and few interoperable. Technology Advancement funds:

- EHR upgrades and replacements at facilities with obsolete systems
- Interoperability standards enabling data exchange across facilities
- Integration with regional health information exchanges
- Training for clinical and administrative staff on new systems

**Health Information Exchange**

Mississippi lacks statewide health information exchange infrastructure connecting providers across settings. Technology Advancement builds regional exchange capacity supporting CRIS integration. Patients moving between facilities have their records available regardless of which EHR each facility uses.

**Cybersecurity Enhancement**

Rural hospitals are **increasingly targeted by ransomware and cyberattacks**. Limited IT staff and outdated systems create vulnerabilities. Technology Advancement funds:

- Cybersecurity assessments and remediation
- Security infrastructure upgrades
- Staff training on security practices
- Incident response planning and support

**Broadband and Connectivity**

Telehealth cannot function without reliable internet. Technology Advancement supports broadband expansion and connectivity improvements in healthcare facilities and surrounding communities. While broadband infrastructure is primarily funded through other federal programs (USDA, FCC), RHTP funds can support last-mile connectivity and facility upgrades.

**Data Analytics Capacity**

Population health management requires data analytics capabilities that most rural providers lack. Technology Advancement builds analytics infrastructure for quality monitoring, outcomes tracking, and strategic planning.

## Initiative 6: Telehealth Adoption and Provider Support

**Estimated Budget**: $60-80 million over five years

The Telehealth Adoption Initiative **increases virtual care access, supports providers in adopting telehealth, and explores innovative care models** leveraging technology to extend care into underserved areas.

**Telehealth Platform Expansion**

Building on UMMC's existing telehealth infrastructure, Mississippi expands virtual care platforms across rural facilities. Components include:

- **Telepsychiatry** addressing behavioral health shortages through virtual consultations
- **Telestroke** enabling rapid stroke diagnosis and treatment initiation at rural hospitals
- **Telespecialty consultations** in cardiology, dermatology, neurology, and other specialties
- **Telemonitoring** for chronic disease management
- **Direct-to-consumer telehealth** enabling patients to access care from home

**Provider Training and Support**

Telehealth adoption requires more than technology. Providers must integrate virtual care into clinical workflows, develop skills for video-based patient interactions, and adapt practice patterns. Telehealth Adoption funds:

- Provider training programs
- Technical support for facilities implementing telehealth
- Quality assurance and clinical oversight
- Reimbursement guidance and billing support

**Remote Patient Monitoring**

Patients with chronic conditions (diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, COPD) benefit from continuous monitoring that enables early intervention before crises require hospitalization. Remote monitoring programs deploy connected devices (blood pressure cuffs, glucometers, pulse oximeters, scales) and establish clinical protocols for responding to concerning trends.

**Innovative Care Models**

Telehealth Adoption supports pilot programs testing new care delivery approaches:

- Store-and-forward consultations for dermatology and radiology
- Virtual urgent care reducing unnecessary emergency department visits
- Hospital-at-home programs enabling acute care in patient residences
- School-based telehealth connecting students to providers

**Key Partner**:

The **University of Mississippi Medical Center** operates the state's largest telehealth network and serves as the primary hub for specialty consultations. UMMC's telehealth infrastructure, established over many years, provides a foundation for RHTP expansion rather than requiring new system development.

## Social Care Integration

Mississippi's RHTP application, as described in public announcements, does not prominently feature **social determinants of health (SDOH) screening, community health worker (CHW) deployment, or community information exchange (CIE) platforms** as distinct initiatives. Social care components appear embedded within other initiatives rather than established as dedicated infrastructure.

**SDOH/HRSN Analysis**

| Component | Evidence in Plan | Assessment |
|-----------|------------------|------------|
| SDOH Screening Requirements | Not explicitly described | Embedded or absent |
| HRSN Navigation | Community-based services mentioned under CRIS | Partial |
| CHW Deployment | Not explicitly described as distinct program | Limited evidence |
| CIE Platform | Not explicitly described | Unknown |
| 211 Integration | Not mentioned | Unknown |

**Implications**

The absence of prominent social care language does not necessarily mean Mississippi ignores social determinants. CRIS's community-based services component may incorporate SDOH screening and navigation. Workforce Expansion may include CHW training within broader career pathway programs. Technology Advancement may include CIE infrastructure within health information exchange development.

However, the lack of explicit commitment to social care infrastructure raises concerns. States with strong social care integration (North Carolina's Healthy Opportunities, California's CalAIM) have dedicated programs, funding streams, and accountability mechanisms. Mississippi's approach appears to treat social care as embedded rather than protected, making it vulnerable to cuts or deprioritization when implementation constraints bite.

**Social Care Integration Summary Table**

| Component | Requested | Estimated Allocation | Vendor/Operator | Status |
|-----------|-----------|---------------------|-----------------|--------|
| SDOH Screening | Unknown | Embedded in CRIS | Unknown | Uncertain |
| HRSN Navigation | Implicit in community services | Embedded | Delta Health Alliance (possible) | At Risk |
| CHW Deployment | Not explicit | Unknown | Unknown | Uncertain |
| CIE Platform | Not explicit | Unknown | Unknown | Uncertain |

**Existing Infrastructure**

Mississippi has existing social care infrastructure that RHTP could leverage:

- **Delta Health Alliance** operates resource and referral centers, Promise Community programs, and workforce development initiatives in the Delta region
- **Mississippi 211** provides statewide information and referral services
- **Community Action Agencies** deliver social services in rural areas
- **Faith-based organizations** provide informal social support networks

Whether RHTP integrates with or bypasses this existing infrastructure remains unclear from public documentation.

## Funding Flow Documentation

**State to Federal to Implementation**

RHTP funds flow from CMS to the State of Mississippi, with the **Office of the Governor** serving as the lead agency. The Department of Finance and Administration handles fiscal management. From the state, funds flow to implementing organizations through subawards and contracts.

```

**Intermediary Roles**

**Mississippi Hospital Association (MHA)**: MHA's Center for Rural Health and the Mississippi Rural Hospital Alliance coordinate technical assistance, network development, and workforce initiatives. MHA serves as a pass-through for funds reaching rural hospitals and as a convener for regional coordination.

**Mississippi Primary Health Care Association (MPHCA)**: MPHCA represents FQHCs and community health centers. Funds flowing to primary care infrastructure may pass through MPHCA for distribution and coordination.

**University of Mississippi Medical Center (UMMC)**: UMMC serves as the academic anchor for workforce development (residencies, medical education) and telehealth hub for specialty consultations. Substantial RHTP funds flow to UMMC for these functions.

**Delta Health Alliance (DHA)**: DHA operates community health programs in the Delta region and may receive funds for community integration, social services, and workforce development specific to the Delta.

**Administrative Retention**

Federal rules allow states to retain a portion of RHTP funds for administration. Mississippi's administrative costs are estimated at $20-30 million over five years (4-6% of total), covering project management, compliance, reporting, and oversight staff.

**Performance Monitoring**

CMS requires quarterly reporting and performance monitoring. Mississippi must demonstrate progress on funded initiatives through metrics including:

- Services delivered and populations reached
- Workforce trained and retained
- Technology deployed and adopted
- Quality improvements achieved
- Financial sustainability indicators

Failure to demonstrate progress could jeopardize future year funding.

## Cross-Initiative Coordination

Mississippi's six initiatives are designed to reinforce each other:

- **Assessment** informs strategic decisions across all initiatives
- **CRIS** provides the coordination framework that **BRIDGE** infrastructure serves
- **Workforce** produces providers who work within **CRIS** networks
- **Technology** enables **Telehealth** and supports **CRIS** data integration
- **Telehealth** extends specialty access that **BRIDGE** establishes

The risk is that initiatives proceed in silos without integration. Assessment could produce recommendations that implementation ignores. CRIS could develop regional structures disconnected from workforce initiatives. Technology investments could create infrastructure that providers fail to adopt.

**Sequencing Dependencies**

Some initiatives must precede others:

1. **Technology infrastructure** must exist before **Telehealth** can scale
2. **Assessment** should inform **BRIDGE** pilot program design
3. **CRIS governance** must form before regional coordination functions
4. **Workforce pipelines** require years before producing graduates

Mississippi's two-year obligation timeline creates pressure to launch all initiatives simultaneously rather than sequencing optimally. This compression may produce coordination failures as interdependent programs proceed without adequate integration.

## What the Plan Assumes

Mississippi's RHTP strategy rests on assumptions that may or may not prove accurate:

**Regional coordination can form quickly.** CRIS allocates substantial funding to regional network development, expecting functional health districts within two to three years. Other states' experience suggests that regional coordination requires longer gestation periods to build trust and operational capacity. Mississippi is attempting accelerated development with significant funding, but provider relationships may not respond to financial incentives alone.

**Workforce pipelines produce retention, not just training.** Workforce Expansion invests in residency expansion, scholarships, and incentives, assuming that trained providers will remain in Mississippi. National data shows mixed results for retention programs. Mississippi may succeed in training physicians who then leave for urban practice elsewhere.

**Technology infrastructure enables transformation rather than becoming an end in itself.** Technology Advancement invests heavily in digital infrastructure. Technology investments can produce impressive capabilities that remain underutilized if workflow integration fails or provider adoption lags. The assumption is that Mississippi will achieve both deployment and adoption.

**The statewide assessment produces actionable findings in time to matter.** Assessment findings anticipated in 2027-2028 may arrive too late to inform implementation decisions made in 2026. The assumption that comprehensive analysis guides transformation may conflict with timeline realities.

**Medicaid cuts do not overwhelm transformation gains.** Mississippi's plan proceeds against a backdrop of federal Medicaid reductions beginning in 2029. The plan does not explicitly model the interaction between transformation investment and Medicaid erosion. The implicit assumption is that transformation produces efficiency gains sufficient to offset Medicaid losses. This assumption may be tested severely.

**State and local partners maintain commitment through five years.** Implementation depends on hospitals, community organizations, academic institutions, and local governments sustaining engagement through the full program period. Political changes, leadership turnover, and competing priorities may erode partner commitment before transformation is complete.

**Post-2030 funding materializes.** The plan aims to create sustainable systems, but sustainability requires revenue sources beyond RHTP. Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, commercial insurance, state appropriations, and local support must collectively sustain what RHTP builds. If these sources prove insufficient, transformation investments become stranded costs.

## Conclusion

Mississippi proposes to invest approximately $500 million to $1 billion over five years in a six-initiative transformation strategy emphasizing regional coordination (CRIS), infrastructure and specialty access (BRIDGE), workforce development, technology modernization, and telehealth expansion. A statewide assessment will provide evidence for strategic refinement.

**CRIS represents the strategic centerpiece**, betting that regional coordination can achieve efficiencies and improvements that fragmented systems cannot. The approach mirrors successful models elsewhere but requires relationship building that funding alone cannot accelerate.

**Workforce Expansion addresses the crisis underlying all other challenges.** Without providers, infrastructure and technology accomplish nothing. Mississippi's emphasis on growing its own workforce acknowledges that external recruitment cannot meet needs.

**Technology and Telehealth initiatives build digital infrastructure** enabling other initiatives to function. These investments create capabilities that persist beyond funding if adoption succeeds.

**The governance structure concentrates authority** in the governor's office, enabling coordinated implementation but creating accountability and transparency concerns. Mississippi's refusal to release its full application publicly limits external assessment of plan quality and adequacy.

**Social care integration is embedded rather than protected.** The absence of prominent SDOH, CHW, and CIE language suggests social care may be vulnerable when implementation constraints force triage.

The plan's assumptions are plausible but unproven. Regional coordination must form quickly despite historical fragmentation. Workforce investments must produce retention, not just training. Technology must achieve adoption, not just deployment. Assessment must inform decisions in time to matter. Transformation gains must outpace Medicaid erosion. Partners must sustain commitment. Funding must continue or alternatives must emerge.

Part 3 of this analysis assesses what works, what struggles, what gets cut when funding constraints bite, and whether Mississippi's strategic bet can possibly succeed given the state's status as America's most challenging rural health context.
