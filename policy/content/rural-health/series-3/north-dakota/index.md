*January 2026*

North Dakota received **$199 million in FY2026 RHTP funding**, placing it near the national average in absolute terms but among the highest per capita recipients in the nation. The funding formula's $100 million baseline allocation delivers disproportionate benefit to low-population states, positioning North Dakota for **approximately $442 per rural resident** compared to Texas's $60 or Ohio's $71.

Governor Kelly Armstrong called the award "a once-in-a-generation opportunity to rethink and reshape how health care is delivered to our rural communities." The state's application centers on four strategic initiatives: **workforce development, preventive wellness, bringing care closer to home, and technology integration**. A special legislative session convening January 21, 2026 will formally appropriate the funding.

The question for North Dakota is not survival but optimization. Unlike crisis states where RHTP represents triage funding, North Dakota enters implementation from relative strength: Medicaid expansion since 2015, near-universal broadband coverage, and stable rural hospital infrastructure. The challenge is converting these advantages into measurable transformation.

## Rural Health Landscape

**State Demographics**

North Dakota encompasses **68,982 square miles** with approximately **789,000 residents**, making it the 4th least populated state nationally. Population density averages 11.3 persons per square mile. Most counties have fewer than 5,000 residents, including **36 counties classified as frontier** with population density of six or fewer residents per square mile.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Population | ~789,000 |
| Rural Population | ~450,000 (57%) |
| Counties | 53 |
| Frontier Counties | 36 |
| Population Density | 11.3 per sq. mile |
| Median Age | 35.4 years |

North Dakota's relatively young population (4th youngest state nationally by median age) and growing trajectory contrast with many rural states experiencing population decline. Cass County (Fargo) and Burleigh County (Bismarck) concentrate approximately 40% of state population in just two urban centers, leaving vast rural territory sparsely populated.

**Tribal Nations**

Five federally recognized tribes and one Indian community comprise **4.9% of North Dakota's population**, well above the national average:

- Mandan, Hidatsa & Arikara Nation (Three Affiliated Tribes)
- Spirit Lake Nation
- Standing Rock Sioux Tribe
- Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians
- Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate Nation
- Trenton Indian Service Area

Almost 60% of American Indians live on reservations comprising some of the most rural areas of the state. The median age of North Dakota's Native population (27.9 years) runs approximately seven years younger than the overall state median. Tribal communities face dramatic health disparities: average age at death for Native Americans is 59.6 years compared to 79.7 years for the white population.

Two IHS hospitals and multiple tribal health facilities operate alongside the state healthcare system, creating coordination requirements that RHTP implementation must navigate.

**Healthcare Infrastructure**

North Dakota maintains one of the nation's most stable rural healthcare networks:

| Facility Type | Count |
|---------------|-------|
| Critical Access Hospitals | 37 |
| Rural Health Clinics | 54 |
| FQHCs and Satellites | 19 |
| Total Hospitals | 52 |
| IHS/Tribal Facilities | 2 hospitals + clinics |

The **37 Critical Access Hospitals** provide distributed access across the state. Unlike crisis states experiencing closures, North Dakota's CAH network remains intact. Seven North Dakota CAHs received 2025 Top 100 designation from The Chartis Center for Rural Health, with several ranking among the Top 20 nationally, signaling both quality performance and financial stability uncommon in the rural hospital sector.

The "Big Six" hospitals in Fargo, Grand Forks, Bismarck, and Minot anchor regional care with Level II trauma centers. All hospitals except one IHS facility hold trauma center designation.

**Health Professional Shortages**

Despite relative infrastructure stability, workforce distribution remains challenging:

| Designation | Counties Affected |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Mental Health HPSA | Majority |
| Primary Care HPSA | Majority |
| Dental HPSA | Significant |

Provider maldistribution concentrates physicians and specialists in urban centers while rural and frontier areas face access gaps. The state needs 500 additional physicians by 2025 if population projections hold, according to UND School of Medicine analysis. The challenge is not just total numbers but geographic distribution across vast territory.

**Behavioral Health Transformation**

North Dakota required all human service centers to convert to **Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic (CCBHC)** status through recent legislation. CCBHCs ensure access to comprehensive behavioral health care regardless of ability to pay, mandate 24/7 crisis services access, and require coordination with physical health and social support services. This existing infrastructure positions RHTP behavioral health initiatives for integration rather than construction.

## RHTP Award and Context

**Funding Position**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| FY2026 Allocation | $198,936,970 |
| Baseline Component | $100,000,000 |
| Workload Component | $98,936,970 |
| Five-Year Projected Total | $500M to $1B |
| Per Rural Resident | ~$442 |
| National Ranking (Absolute) | 49th |
| National Ranking (Per Capita) | Top 5 |

The funding formula's structure creates North Dakota's favorable position. The **$100 million baseline** delivered equally to all states provides $222 per rural resident before workload factors even apply. Small states with genuine rural territory receive disproportionate per capita benefit.

North Dakota's per capita advantage places it among the most favorably positioned states alongside Alaska ($368), Wyoming, Montana ($324), and South Dakota ($513). This contrasts sharply with large rural states where per capita funding falls below $100.

**Formula Mechanics**

| Component | Allocation | Basis |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| 50% Equal Distribution | $100M | State approval |
| 50% Workload Factors | ~$99M | Rurality metrics, application score |

CMS evaluated applications through merit review incorporating federal and non-federal subject matter experts. North Dakota's strong score reflects both application quality and alignment with statutory priorities including healthy eating initiatives and technology deployment.

**Medicaid Context**

North Dakota expanded Medicaid in 2015, reducing uninsured rates substantially. The state periodically reauthorizes expansion, most recently through June 2025 legislation. Approximately **105,000 North Dakotans** enrolled in Medicaid/CHIP as of mid-2025, representing 50% growth from pre-ACA enrollment of roughly 70,000.

However, Medicaid unwinding produced significant coverage losses. The state's children's uninsured rate rose from 3.6% in 2023 to 6.7% in 2024, the **largest increase nationally** according to American Community Survey data. Nearly 63,000 people were disenrolled during redetermination, though new enrollment partially offset losses.

H.R. 1 Medicaid provisions will stress North Dakota's healthcare system despite expansion status. CAHs across the state depend on Medicaid revenues that may face federal cuts.

## State Approach

**Governance Structure**

North Dakota Health and Human Services serves as lead agency. **Sarah Aker**, Medical Services Executive Director, led application development. Interim Commissioner **Pat Traynor** oversees implementation planning. Governor Armstrong provides executive engagement, hosting press conferences highlighting the award and convening the special legislative session.

HHS expects the **first subaward grant opportunities in Q1 2026** following legislative appropriation. Federal statute requires obligation by October 2026 and expenditure by year end, creating tight implementation timelines.

**The Center for Rural Health** at the University of North Dakota School of Medicine & Health Sciences provides technical assistance through the Flex Program and CAH Quality Network. This existing infrastructure supports rapid deployment of RHTP resources to rural facilities.

**Four Strategic Initiatives**

North Dakota's application organizes transformation efforts around four pillars:

**Initiative 1: Strengthen and Stabilize Rural Health Workforce**

Expanding healthcare training pipelines through:
- Residency expansion and rural training tracks
- Loan repayment tied to 5-year rural service commitments
- Specialized training in obstetrics and behavioral health for primary care
- Technology deployment as workforce extender
- Remote monitoring and smart technology reducing physical staffing demands

Workforce development emerged as the **most popular priority** in stakeholder surveys, reflecting recognition that access depends on having providers to deliver care.

**Initiative 2: Make North Dakota Healthy Again**

Preventive wellness programs including:
- **Eat Well ND**: Nutrition education embedding dietary guidance into clinical workflows
- **ND Moves Together**: Physical activity promotion and community fitness programs
- Connection and resilience programming targeting mental health and isolation
- Focus on children's wellness and chronic disease prevention

The state submitted a SNAP waiver request to USDA seeking authority to limit purchases of unhealthy foods, aligning with CMS scoring criteria that reward such policy actions. FNS indicated no concerns and anticipated approval.

**Initiative 3: Bring High-Quality Health Care Closer to Home**

Expanding access through:
- Telehealth infrastructure for primary, behavioral health, and specialty care
- Mobile clinic deployment for primary, specialist, and dental care
- Health kiosk deployment in community settings
- Community health worker and paramedic infrastructure expansion
- Care coordination programs for chronic disease and behavioral health

This initiative targets the reality that vast distances constitute fundamental barriers in frontier territory where communities may be 100 miles apart.

**Initiative 4: Connect Technology, Data, and Providers**

Building statewide infrastructure including:
- Health data hub modernization
- Electronic health record integration
- Health Information Exchange expansion through NDHIN
- Data interoperability and AI applications
- Cybersecurity reinforcement

North Dakota already achieved **95.4% broadband coverage at 100+ Mbps**, positioning for universal connectivity by 2028 (potentially first state nationally). Senator Hoeven notes: "We're ahead of everybody. Nobody has basically fiber-optic to just about every home." This broadband foundation enables telehealth expansion that other states must first construct.

## Program and Funding Distribution

**Estimated Allocation by Initiative**

| Initiative | Estimated FY2026 | Focus |
|------------|------------------|-------|
| Workforce Development | $40-50M | Training, loan repayment, retention |
| Make ND Healthy Again | $35-50M | Eat Well ND, ND Moves Together |
| Bring Care Closer | $50-60M | Telehealth, mobile clinics, kiosks |
| Technology & Data | $30-40M | Data hub, HIE expansion |
| Administrative | $15-20M | RHTP unit, oversight, monitoring |

*Estimates based on application themes and comparable state allocations; official allocation pending legislative appropriation*

**Key Implementation Partners**

| Organization | Role |
|--------------|------|
| ND Center for Rural Health (UND) | Technical assistance, Flex Program, CAH Quality Network |
| North Dakota Hospital Association | CAH coordination, advocacy |
| North Dakota Primary Care Association | FQHC coordination |
| Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Dakota | Medicaid expansion administration |
| Tribal Health Organizations | Tribal nation coordination |
| North Dakota Information Technology | Broadband infrastructure |

The Center for Rural Health at UND brings established relationships with all 37 CAHs through the Flex Program and Quality Network. Recent meetings drew representatives from 31 of 37 CAHs, demonstrating engagement infrastructure RHTP implementation can leverage.

## Social Care Integration

**SDOH/HRSN Components**

| Component | Included | Funding | Implementation | Likely Funded? |
|-----------|----------|---------|----------------|----------------|
| SDOH Screening | Yes (embedded) | Included in wellness | Clinical workflow integration | Yes |
| HRSN Navigation | Limited | Not explicit | Through CHW expansion | At Risk |
| CHW Deployment | Yes | ~$10-15M | Training, certification, deployment | Yes |
| CIE Platform | Limited | Not explicit | NDHIN expansion | At Risk |

North Dakota's application emphasizes wellness and prevention over explicit SDOH infrastructure, embedding social determinants work within clinical transformation rather than separate programming. The **Eat Well ND** and **ND Moves Together** initiatives address food and activity as health determinants through education and community programs rather than referral infrastructure.

**Community Health Worker Strategy**

The state proposes CHW and paramedic infrastructure expansion without detailed deployment targets in public materials. CHW training and certification receive attention within workforce development, but explicit FTE targets and geographic deployment priorities await implementation planning.

**Technology Platform Status**

The **North Dakota Health Information Network (NDHIN)** provides statewide health information exchange. RHTP funding targets expanding participation and interoperability rather than procuring new platforms. Existing Medicaid Telehealth billing infrastructure (updated October 2025) supports synchronous telehealth reimbursement.

## Assessment

**What Works**

**Broadband Foundation**: With 95.4% coverage at 100+ Mbps and trajectory toward universal connectivity by 2028, North Dakota possesses infrastructure that other states must construct. Telehealth initiatives can deploy on existing broadband rather than waiting for buildout.

**Stable Healthcare Network**: The 37 CAHs remain operational with multiple Top 100 designations signaling financial and quality performance. RHTP investment can enhance functioning systems rather than rescue failing ones.

**Per Capita Advantage**: The $442 per rural resident substantially exceeds large rural states, providing resources for genuine transformation investment rather than purely defensive spending. North Dakota can attempt innovation that crisis states cannot afford.

**CCBHC Conversion**: All human service centers converting to CCBHC status provides behavioral health infrastructure that integrates with RHTP programming. This existing platform reduces implementation burden for behavioral health initiatives.

**Wellness Alignment**: The Make North Dakota Healthy Again initiatives align with CMS's Make Rural America Healthy Again priorities, positioning favorably for scoring and annual award recalculation.

**What Struggles**

**Implementation Timeline**: Federal statute requires obligation by October 2026 and expenditure by December 2026. From January special session through grant announcement to deployment leaves minimal time for careful procurement and program design.

**Tribal Coordination Complexity**: Five tribes plus the Trenton Indian Service Area, two IHS hospitals, and multiple tribal health systems create coordination requirements. RHTP flows through the state, but tribal health operates under federal sovereignty with distinct systems.

**Workforce Distribution**: Despite favorable overall positioning, physician maldistribution concentrates providers in Fargo, Bismarck, Grand Forks, and Minot. Moving providers to frontier communities requires more than financial incentives, addressing quality of life, spouse employment, and professional isolation.

**Children's Coverage Erosion**: The largest national increase in children's uninsured rates (3.6% to 6.7%) signals post-pandemic coverage instability that RHTP cannot directly address. Transformation faces headwinds if underlying coverage erodes.

**Sustainability Beyond 2030**

North Dakota's fiscal position provides stronger post-2030 outlook than most states. Energy sector revenues and conservative budget management create capacity for continued investment if programs demonstrate value. The state's periodic Medicaid expansion reauthorization demonstrates willingness to sustain healthcare investment when benefits prove clear.

However, RHTP-level funding ($199 million annually) exceeds what state resources could replace without federal participation. The critical question is whether initiatives achieve sustainability through efficiency gains and revenue model innovation or require ongoing external support.

## Critical Success Factors

**Legislative Session Execution**: The January 21-23 special session must appropriate funds without constraints that impede flexible implementation. Appropriation language shapes program design.

**Tribal Partnership Formalization**: Meaningful tribal engagement requires moving beyond consultation to concrete partnership arrangements ensuring RHTP benefits reach reservation populations experiencing the most severe disparities.

**Workforce Retention Focus**: Recruitment receives attention, but North Dakota's challenge may be retention. Provider isolation, limited career advancement, and spouse employment challenges drive turnover that recruitment incentives cannot overcome.

**Telehealth Utilization Conversion**: Broadband infrastructure enables telehealth but does not guarantee adoption. Converting connectivity into actual healthcare utilization requires provider training, patient education, and workflow integration.

**Measurement Infrastructure**: RHTP requires performance tracking. Whether North Dakota's existing data systems support required monitoring determines whether the state can demonstrate value and secure continued annual funding.

## Conclusion

North Dakota enters RHTP implementation from relative advantage. The funding formula's baseline allocation delivers $442 per rural resident, stable healthcare infrastructure provides foundation for enhancement rather than rescue, and near-universal broadband enables telehealth deployment. The state's four strategic initiatives address genuine needs through workforce development, preventive wellness, access expansion, and technology integration.

The January 21 special session marks implementation's formal start. From appropriation through Q1 2026 grant announcements to October obligation deadlines, North Dakota faces compressed timelines for deploying unprecedented federal investment. Success requires converting political excitement into operational execution.

For North Dakota's approximately 450,000 rural residents, including tribal populations experiencing profound health disparities, RHTP represents opportunity to transform healthcare access across vast frontier territory. The state that pioneered broadband deployment to every farm and ranch now attempts equivalent achievement in healthcare.

Whether the frontier formula advantage translates to frontier health transformation determines RHTP's meaning for North Dakota: not rescue funding for crisis intervention but investment capital for deliberate improvement in a state that enters implementation from strength rather than desperation.
