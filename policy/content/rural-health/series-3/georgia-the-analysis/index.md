Part 2 documented what Georgia proposes: **GREAT Health** channels $218.8 million through nine initiatives emphasizing disaster resilience, technology deployment, and workforce recruitment. The 96-page application prioritizes physical infrastructure over social care integration, positions satellite connectivity as a rural broadband solution, and dedicates $30 million to Medicaid eligibility system upgrades of questionable transformation value.

This analysis evaluates what actually works, what struggles against implementation headwinds, and what gets cut when plans meet reality. The framework applies pragmatic realism: acknowledging what RHTP can achieve in Georgia while refusing to pretend $75 per capita transforms healthcare for 2.9 million rural residents in a state where **18 of 30 rural hospitals face closure risk** and partial Medicaid expansion through Georgia Pathways has enrolled fewer than 7,000 against 175,000 in the coverage gap.

**Central question**: Can infrastructure-first strategy produce meaningful health improvement for rural Georgians, or do structural constraints (coverage gaps, Pathways failure, Medicaid cuts, the Black Belt health crisis) render GREAT Health a fortification exercise for systems that cannot serve their communities?

The evidence suggests selective success: disaster resilience investments protect physical infrastructure, technology deployment extends capacity where connectivity exists, and workforce recruitment begins pipelines that produce providers after RHTP ends. Social care integration was never funded and cannot survive what was never created. **The coverage gap remains the constraint that infrastructure cannot address.** Transformed hospitals cannot serve patients who cannot afford care.

## What Works

### Disaster Resilience and Shelter-in-Place Capacity

**Assessment: Strong Implementation Probability**

The flagship initiative addresses a real and measurable problem. Georgia's rural hospitals **cannot serve communities if they fail during storms**. The state sits in hurricane and severe weather corridors. Southwest Georgia facilities have experienced repeated disaster-related disruptions. Infrastructure investment that enables shelter-in-place operations represents genuine capacity protection.

**Why it works**:

**The need is concrete and documented.** Hurricanes Michael (2018) and Irma (2017) exposed infrastructure vulnerabilities at rural Georgia hospitals. Power failures, supply chain disruptions, and structural damage forced evacuations and service suspensions. Investment preventing future disruptions addresses demonstrated risk.

**Implementation timeline aligns with available funding.** Generator procurement, structural hardening, and supply stockpiling occur within twelve to eighteen months. Unlike workforce pipelines producing providers in 2035, disaster resilience investment yields operational capacity within Year 1.

**Metrics are straightforward.** Number of facilities with enhanced generator capacity, hours of backup power available, structural hardening completed, supply stockpiles positioned. DCH can demonstrate progress through infrastructure counts rather than health outcome measures requiring longer observation periods.

**Political sustainability is strong.** Disaster preparedness appeals across political spectrum. Rural legislators understand storm vulnerability. Federal emergency management priorities align. Investment survives administration changes because disasters do not respect electoral cycles.

**Limitation**: Disaster resilience protects infrastructure, not health. Hospitals that survive storms but cannot cover payroll remain financially fragile. Infrastructure investment cannot substitute for coverage expansion, workforce adequacy, or operational sustainability. Georgia protects buildings while the services within them erode.

### Telehealth Pods in Connected Communities

**Assessment: Moderate Success in Limited Geography**

Georgia's telehealth pod initiative works where prerequisites exist. For the estimated **1.5 to 1.8 million rural Georgians** with reliable broadband, health literacy enabling technology use, and coverage permitting care access, telehealth pods provide genuine capacity expansion.

**Why it works in context**:

**Specialist access represents real constraint.** Rural Georgia residents travel 60 to 90 minutes for specialty consultations that urban Georgians access within their communities. Telehealth pods positioned in libraries, community centers, and health departments bring dermatology, cardiology, and behavioral health consultations to communities that cannot attract resident specialists.

**Staffing model leverages existing workers.** Health department staff, library personnel, and community health workers can assist patients with pod technology without requiring clinical licensure. The model extends capacity without requiring scarce clinical workforce.

**Evidence from other states supports approach.** Kentucky's rural telehealth kiosks, Tennessee's virtual care expansion, and Texas's telehealth network demonstrate telehealth adoption in comparable populations. Georgia adapts proven models rather than experimenting.

**What limits success**:

**Connectivity determines geography.** Pods require broadband. Communities without terrestrial internet depend on Starlink deployment that may or may not proceed on RHTP timelines. The communities most needing care access often lack infrastructure enabling technology solutions.

**Coverage determines utilization.** Telehealth consultations generate bills. Uninsured patients using pods create uncompensated care for connecting specialists. The coverage gap constrains pod utilization to populations with insurance regardless of technology availability.

### Cybersecurity Enhancement for Vulnerable Systems

**Assessment: Strong Implementation Probability**

Rural healthcare organizations face **escalating cybersecurity threats** while operating with minimal IT resources. Georgia hospitals have experienced ransomware attacks disrupting operations and compromising patient data. Security assessment and vulnerability remediation address demonstrated operational risk.

**Why it works**:

**The threat is real and growing.** Healthcare cyberattacks increased 90% between 2020 and 2023. Rural hospitals with limited IT staff and aging systems represent attractive targets. A successful ransomware attack can shut down hospital operations entirely.

**The investment is discrete and measurable.** Security assessments identify specific vulnerabilities. Remediation addresses identified gaps. Staff training reduces human-factor risk. Each component produces documentable improvement within twelve-month implementation windows.

**Federal compliance requirements provide sustainability.** HIPAA security requirements and CMS conditions of participation mandate baseline cybersecurity. Investment establishing compliance creates ongoing maintenance obligations that survive RHTP funding cessation.

**Limitation**: Cybersecurity protects operations but does not expand care. Secure systems at hospitals facing financial collapse remain financially collapsed. The investment protects infrastructure; it does not address utilization, coverage, or workforce constraints that determine whether infrastructure serves communities.

## What Struggles

### Starlink Dependency and Sustainability

**Assessment: High Implementation Risk**

Georgia explicitly proposes contracting with **Elon Musk's Starlink satellite internet** for rural healthcare connectivity. This creates dependency, cost sustainability, and political risks that distinguish Georgia's approach from states pursuing terrestrial broadband buildout.

**The challenges**:

**Ongoing service costs threaten sustainability.** Starlink business service runs $250 monthly or higher. A facility receiving Starlink through RHTP must absorb this cost after 2030 or lose connectivity. Rural hospitals operating on negative margins cannot sustain $3,000 annual internet expenses per site.

**Sole-source procurement raises questions.** Naming Starlink specifically in the application bypasses competitive procurement that might identify lower-cost alternatives. The choice reflects political alignment more than operational optimization.

**Service quality varies by congestion.** Starlink performance degrades as user density increases. Healthcare applications requiring consistent low-latency connections may experience quality issues as rural Starlink adoption grows.

**BEAD Program timeline creates alternatives.** Federal broadband infrastructure funding flows to Georgia over three to five years. Terrestrial fiber buildout may reach communities before RHTP's five-year window closes, making Starlink investment obsolete.

**The sustainability question**: What happens when RHTP funding ends and facilities cannot afford continued Starlink service? Georgia builds connectivity infrastructure dependent on subscription payments that financially fragile hospitals cannot sustain.

### Nurse Recruitment Versus Workforce Reality

**Assessment: Modest Impact Against Structural Shortage**

Georgia proposes nurse recruitment campaigns, scholarships, and retention programs channeling $20-25 million toward workforce expansion. The initiative addresses documented shortages but cannot overcome structural workforce constraints at proposed scale.

**The arithmetic**:

Georgia lacks approximately **6,000 registered nurses** statewide, with shortages concentrated in rural areas. RHTP funding at proposed levels might add 200-300 nurses to rural practice over five years through scholarships and recruitment. This represents **3-5% of documented shortage**.

**Pipeline timing mismatch persists.** Nursing programs take two to four years. Students entering programs in 2026 complete training in 2028-2030. Pipeline investment produces graduates at RHTP conclusion, with employment depending on post-2030 hospital viability.

**Retention proves harder than recruitment.** Rural nurses leave for better compensation, career advancement, and quality of life in urban settings. Retention programs must compete with structural advantages of urban employment that modest incentives cannot offset.

**Who employs graduates after RHTP?** Hospitals losing Medicaid revenue cannot hire additional nurses regardless of pipeline output. The initiative produces trained nurses; employment depends on hospital financial survival that RHTP cannot guarantee.

### Gateway Medicaid System Upgrades

**Assessment: Questionable Transformation Value**

Georgia allocates **$30 million** for Gateway Medicaid eligibility system upgrades, representing 14% of the annual award. This allocation raises questions about whether RHTP should fund state Medicaid administrative infrastructure rather than direct healthcare transformation.

**The concerns**:

**Benefit flows to state administration, not healthcare delivery.** Gateway improvements accelerate eligibility processing. Faster processing matters only if people can enroll in programs. Georgia Pathways' enrollment failure suggests administrative systems are not the primary barrier.

**Georgia Pathways demonstrates the problem is policy, not technology.** As of late 2024, Pathways enrolled approximately 6,500 active members against 175,000 in the coverage gap. ProPublica reporting found **$86.9 million spent** on the program with 47% going to consultants and eligibility technology. The problem is work requirements and program design, not system technology.

**Opportunity cost is real.** $30 million directed to Gateway upgrades could fund telehealth pods, workforce scholarships, or transportation networks directly serving rural residents. Instead, it funds administrative infrastructure with uncertain benefit for rural healthcare access.

**The calculation**: If Gateway improvements enabled 10,000 additional Pathways enrollees, RHTP would spend $3,000 per enrollment on administrative systems alone. This assumes improvements translate to enrollment, which Georgia Pathways history does not support.

### Health Information Technology Without Interoperability

**Assessment: Fragmented Implementation Likely**

Georgia proposes EHR modernization, interoperability improvements, and AI diagnostic support. Implementation faces coordination challenges that produce technology deployment without transformation.

**The challenges**:

**Vendor fragmentation complicates interoperability.** Georgia rural hospitals use multiple EHR vendors (Epic, Cerner, Meditech, others). Interoperability requires data exchange standards, interface development, and ongoing maintenance that vendor diversity complicates.

**Health Information Exchange infrastructure remains incomplete.** Georgia Health Information Network (GaHIN) provides some exchange capability, but rural provider participation is uneven. RHTP investment may fund EHR upgrades at facilities not connected to exchange infrastructure.

**AI diagnostic tools require integration.** Clinical decision support adds value when integrated into provider workflows. Bolt-on applications that interrupt rather than support clinical processes face adoption resistance regardless of technical capability.

**What likely survives**: Individual facility EHR upgrades proceed independently. Interoperability improvements connect some but not all facilities. AI tools see pilot deployment without systematic adoption. The technology investment produces modernized systems; the coordination producing transformation does not emerge.

## What Gets Cut

### Triage Under Partial Funding

Georgia requested **$1.4 billion over five years**. It received approximately $1.1 billion (16% of first-year request extrapolated). Resource constraints force prioritization. The following reveals what actually matters versus what receives rhetorical emphasis:

**Initiatives Preserved** (core infrastructure focus):
- Disaster resilience and shelter-in-place (flagship initiative)
- Cybersecurity enhancement (operational necessity)
- Telehealth pods (demonstrable deployment)
- Gateway system upgrades (state administrative priority)

**Initiatives Reduced** (scaled below application vision):
- Nurse recruitment (fewer scholarships, smaller campaigns)
- Health IT modernization (individual facilities, not system-wide)
- Starlink deployment (limited facilities, not comprehensive)
- Transportation networks (pilot scale, not comprehensive)

**Initiatives Never Funded** (absent from application):
- SDOH screening infrastructure
- Navigation services
- Community health worker deployment
- Community information exchange platforms
- Closed-loop referral systems

### The Revealing Absence

Georgia's application **does not include social care integration as a funded priority**. Unlike Texas's embedded SDOH screening or Tennessee's CHW deployment, Georgia directed its entire allocation toward physical infrastructure and technology. This was a deliberate choice reflecting stakeholder input emphasizing technology solutions.

**What the absence reveals**:

**Stakeholder priorities shaped application.** The 350+ submissions DCH received emphasized technology. Town halls in Cordele, Jasper, Vidalia, and virtually generated input favoring telehealth, connectivity, and infrastructure over social care. Georgia funded what stakeholders requested.

**Political constraints limited options.** Social care integration carries associations with Medicaid expansion and social welfare programming that Georgia's conservative political context makes difficult. Infrastructure investment is politically safer than social services expansion.

**Federal scoring may not require social care.** CMS annual re-scoring criteria emphasize measurable progress on stated initiatives. States that never proposed social care cannot be penalized for not implementing it. Georgia optimized for scoring its chosen approach rather than comprehensive transformation.

## Social Care Survival Assessment

### The Partial Funding Question

Georgia received approximately **16% of its five-year request** in Year 1 funding. This partial funding forces triage across all initiative categories. Social care components, never funded in the original application, have nothing to triage.

| Question | Georgia Status |
|----------|----------------|
| What percentage received? | ~16% of Year 1 request |
| Which categories preserved? | Infrastructure, technology, administration |
| Social care survival evidence? | N/A, never funded |

### SDOH/HRSN Survival

**Status: Not applicable. Never funded. Cannot survive.**

Georgia's application does not include:
- Explicit SDOH screening requirements
- Health-related social needs navigation
- Dedicated social care coordinators
- Social needs data integration
- Resource connection workflows

| SDOH Component | Application Status | Survival Status |
|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Screening requirements | Not included | N/A |
| Navigation infrastructure | Not funded | N/A |
| Data capture | Not specified | N/A |
| Needs resolution | Not addressed | N/A |

**What exists outside RHTP**: Individual FQHCs and health systems conduct SDOH screening through their own protocols. Some facilities use Findhelp or similar platforms independently. Georgia's 211 system provides information and referral services. None of this receives RHTP funding or coordination.

### CHW Program Survival

**Status: Not explicitly funded. Does not expand through RHTP.**

Georgia has existing CHW certification through the Georgia Department of Public Health. Health districts employ CHWs through other funding streams. RHTP does not fund:
- CHW training pipeline expansion
- CHW employment support
- Supervision infrastructure
- Deployment targets

| CHW Element | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| Training pipeline | Not RHTP-funded |
| Employment support | Not RHTP-funded |
| Supervision | Not addressed |
| Deployment targets | None specified |

**Telehealth pod staffing may include CHWs** assisting patients with technology. The application does not specify staffing models. CHW inclusion would be incidental rather than strategic workforce deployment.

### CIE Platform Survival

**Status: Not funded. Does not exist at state level.**

Georgia's application does not mandate or fund community information exchange platform procurement. No statewide closed-loop referral system exists or is planned under RHTP.

| CIE Element | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| Statewide platform | Not funded |
| Regional integration | Not funded |
| EHR interoperability | Not SDOH-focused |
| 211 integration | Not addressed |

**What exists**: Georgia's 211 system operates statewide for information and referral. Some health systems use Unite Us, Findhelp, or proprietary platforms. No coordination, integration, or RHTP investment connects these efforts.

### Social Care Survival Summary

| Component | Survival Status | Rationale |
|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| SDOH screening | **N/A** | Never funded in application |
| Navigation services | **N/A** | Never funded in application |
| CHW deployment | **N/A** | Not an RHTP initiative |
| CIE platform | **N/A** | Never funded in application |
| Closed-loop referrals | **N/A** | Never funded in application |
| Needs resolution | **N/A** | Never addressed |

**Bottom line**: Georgia does not capture social needs data through RHTP. It does not resolve them. Social care was not a priority and cannot survive what was never created.

## The 2030 Question

### What Survives When Funding Ends

RHTP ends September 30, 2030. Georgia faces funding cessation precisely when transformed systems must demonstrate sustainability. Disaster resilience investments persist as physical infrastructure. Everything else depends on continued funding streams.

**Sustainable elements** (likely to persist beyond 2030):

- Generator capacity at upgraded facilities
- Structural hardening of hospital buildings
- Cybersecurity improvements integrated into operations
- EHR systems purchased with RHTP funds
- Telehealth pods as physical infrastructure

**Sustainability mechanism**: Physical infrastructure, once built, requires maintenance rather than replacement funding. Generators, buildings, and equipment persist beyond federal funding cessation.

**Unsustainable elements** (dependent on continued funding):

- Starlink service subscriptions
- Nurse recruitment and scholarship programs
- Workforce pipeline operations
- Transportation network subsidies
- Gateway system maintenance beyond initial deployment
- DCH RHTP program administration

**The cliff risk**: Organizations building programs around RHTP funding face abrupt cessation. Training programs lose scholarship funds. Transportation providers lose subsidies. Starlink terminals become expensive paperweights without subscription payments.

### State Commitment Uncertainty

Georgia has not articulated **post-2030 commitment** to sustaining RHTP initiatives. The state budget must absorb ongoing costs for elements requiring continued funding. Political transitions before 2030 may alter priorities.

Governor Kemp's term ends January 2027. The next administration inherits RHTP implementation decisions. Sustainability planning depends on political continuity that cannot be guaranteed.

## The Medicaid Math

### The Arithmetic Georgia Cannot Escape

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| RHTP annual investment | $218.8 million |
| RHTP per rural resident | $75 |
| Rural population | 2.9 million |
| Coverage gap population | 175,000 |
| Georgia Pathways enrollment | ~6,500 |
| Projected Medicaid cuts (Georgia, 10-year) | Est. $30-40 billion |
| RHTP as percentage of projected cuts | **~5-7%** |

RHTP provides $218.8 million annually. Projected Medicaid cuts approach $3-4 billion annually by decade's end. **RHTP offsets 5-7 cents of every dollar Georgia rural healthcare loses through Medicaid reduction.**

### Georgia Pathways: The Failed Alternative

Georgia's partial Medicaid expansion through **Georgia Pathways** was supposed to address the coverage gap without full expansion. The results:

| Metric | Target | Actual |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Enrollment (2-year) | 100,000 | ~6,500 active |
| Cost (through June 2025) | N/A | $110 million |
| Cost per active enrollee | N/A | $13,597 |
| Spending on eligibility technology | N/A | 47% of total |
| Spending on healthcare benefits | N/A | 31% of total |

**ProPublica and The Current** documented that Georgia spent more on consultants and eligibility systems than on healthcare for Pathways members. The work requirement, unique among states, creates documentation barriers that agricultural and seasonal workers cannot overcome.

**The RHTP implication**: Gateway system upgrades cannot solve Pathways' enrollment failure because the barrier is program design, not technology. $30 million in eligibility system investment produces minimal additional enrollment if work requirements remain.

### What Medicaid Cuts Mean for Rural Georgia

**Coverage losses accelerate hospital closures.** Rural hospitals derive 20-35% of revenue from Medicaid. Payment reductions produce operating losses that already-fragile facilities cannot absorb. The 18 Georgia rural hospitals at closure risk face accelerating pressure regardless of RHTP investment.

**The cascade**:

Coverage losses reduce hospital admissions. Reduced admissions decrease revenue. Decreased revenue triggers service cuts. Service cuts drive provider departures. Provider departures accelerate hospital closure. Hospital closure eliminates access regardless of infrastructure investment.

**RHTP cannot prevent this cascade.** Disaster-resilient hospitals with modern generators and cybersecurity still close when they cannot cover payroll. Infrastructure investment protects buildings; coverage expansion sustains services.

## Stated Priorities Versus Actual Priorities

### What Georgia Says

The GREAT Health application emphasizes:
- Disaster resilience protecting hospital operations
- Technology expanding access to underserved communities
- Workforce recruitment addressing chronic shortages
- Connectivity enabling telehealth transformation
- Infrastructure modernization supporting providers

### What Georgia Does

Resource allocation reveals actual priorities:

| Priority | Stated Emphasis | Actual Allocation |
|----------|----------------|------------------|
| Disaster resilience | High | **Highest** (~18% of funds) |
| Gateway upgrades | Not emphasized | **High** (14% of funds) |
| Technology/connectivity | High | **High** (~20-25% of funds) |
| Workforce | High | **Moderate** (10-12% of funds) |
| Social care integration | Not mentioned | **Zero** |

**The revealing allocations**:

**Gateway system upgrades** receive 14% of total funding despite minimal emphasis in public communications. This allocation benefits state administrative infrastructure rather than direct healthcare transformation.

**Social care integration** receives zero allocation. Georgia chose infrastructure over social determinants, technology over community health workers, and disaster resilience over health-related social needs.

### The Alignment Question

Georgia optimizes for physical infrastructure and demonstrable deployment. CMS annual re-scoring evaluates progress on stated initiatives. Georgia can demonstrate:
- Generator installations completed
- Telehealth pods deployed
- Cybersecurity assessments conducted
- EHR upgrades implemented

Georgia need not demonstrate health outcomes improving, coverage expanding, or social needs resolved. The program structure rewards activity documentation. Georgia provides activity.

## Lessons for Other States

### What Georgia's Approach Teaches

**Infrastructure focus provides political safety.** Disaster resilience, cybersecurity, and technology investment face minimal political opposition. Social care integration carries ideological baggage that Georgia avoided by excluding it.

**Stakeholder engagement shapes applications.** Georgia's 350+ submissions and town halls generated applications reflecting stakeholder preferences. Technology solutions emerged as consensus priorities. States seeking community buy-in may find infrastructure and technology easier to build support for than social services expansion.

**Partial Medicaid expansion does not substitute for full expansion.** Georgia Pathways demonstrates that work requirements and complex eligibility verification produce minimal enrollment. States considering partial expansion alternatives should examine Georgia's results before assuming partial solutions address coverage gaps.

### Transferable Elements

- Disaster resilience investment for weather-vulnerable states
- Competitive stakeholder input processes
- Technology deployment to connected communities
- Cybersecurity as operational necessity

### Context-Specific Elements

- Starlink partnership reflecting political alignment
- Gateway allocation prioritizing state administration
- Social care exclusion reflecting political constraints
- Black Belt/Southwest Georgia geographic focus

### What to Avoid

- Assuming coverage gaps do not constrain transformation
- Investing in eligibility systems when policy is the barrier
- Creating vendor dependencies without sustainability planning
- Excluding social care entirely from transformation strategy

## Conclusion

Georgia proposes to transform rural healthcare for 2.9 million residents with $75 per person annually. The **GREAT Health** strategy prioritizes disaster resilience, technology deployment, and administrative infrastructure over social care integration and coverage expansion. The approach reflects Georgia's political constraints, stakeholder preferences, and geographic vulnerabilities.

**What works**: Disaster resilience investments protect physical infrastructure. Telehealth pods extend capacity to connected communities. Cybersecurity enhancements protect vulnerable systems. These elements achieve their limited objectives.

**What struggles**: Starlink dependency creates unsustainable costs. Workforce recruitment cannot overcome structural shortages. Gateway investment cannot solve policy barriers to Pathways enrollment. Health IT deployment fragments without interoperability.

**What does not exist**: Social care integration was never funded and cannot survive. Community health worker deployment was not proposed. Closed-loop referral systems were not contemplated. Georgia's transformation excludes the social determinants framework that other states embed in their strategies.

**The coverage gap remains.** Georgia Pathways enrolls 6,500 against 175,000 in the coverage gap. RHTP cannot create coverage. Transformed hospitals cannot serve patients who cannot afford care. The infrastructure investment creates resilient facilities that may still fail to serve their communities.

**Robin Rau's warning echoes**: "Whenever government puts a bunch of money out, my fear is, you've got some bad actors out there that might try to make the same mistake that puts us there." Georgia's challenge is not bad actors but structural constraints that well-intentioned investment cannot overcome. Hospitals receiving RHTP funding may close anyway. Communities receiving telehealth pods may lack coverage to use them. Infrastructure survives; services within may not.

Rural Georgia's 2.9 million residents watch as $218.8 million flows to facilities that may or may not continue serving them. The buildings may be more resilient. The question is whether anyone will be inside them.
