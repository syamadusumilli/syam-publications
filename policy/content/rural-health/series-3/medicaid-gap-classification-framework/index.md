This technical document provides a **classification framework for analyzing state Medicaid contexts** and how those contexts shape Rural Health Transformation Program (RHTP) implementation. The framework enables systematic comparison of state positions across expansion status, coverage gaps, and the interaction between projected Medicaid cuts and RHTP investment.

**RHTP operates within a Medicaid policy environment that simultaneously undermines its goals.** The One Big Beautiful Bill Act created RHTP alongside $911 billion in Medicaid cuts over ten years. This document quantifies that mismatch at the state level and classifies states by their net fiscal position.

## Part I: Expansion Status Classification

### State Classification by Medicaid Expansion Status

As of January 2026, **40 states and the District of Columbia** have adopted Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. **Ten states** have not adopted expansion, creating coverage gaps that RHTP cannot address.

| Classification | States | Count |
|----------------|--------|-------|
| **Full Expansion** | AK, AZ, AR, CA, CO, CT, DE, HI, IL, IN, IA, KS, KY, LA, ME, MD, MA, MI, MN, MO, MT, NE, NV, NH, NJ, NM, NY, NC, ND, OH, OK, OR, PA, RI, SD, UT, VT, VA, WA, WV, DC | 41 |
| **Partial Expansion (Work Requirements)** | GA | 1 |
| **Limited Expansion (Waiver)** | WI | 1 |
| **Non-Expansion** | AL, FL, KS, MS, SC, TN, TX, WY | 8 |

**Note:** Kansas enacted expansion in 2025 with implementation pending. Georgia operates Georgia Pathways with work requirements since 2023. Wisconsin provides coverage to 100% FPL through waiver but does not receive enhanced FMAP and is classified as non-expansion by CMS.

### Expansion Timeline Categories

| Category | Definition | States |
|----------|------------|--------|
| **Original Expansion (2014)** | Implemented at ACA launch | AZ, AR, CA, CO, CT, DE, HI, IL, IA, KY, MD, MA, MN, NV, NJ, NM, NY, ND, OH, OR, RI, VT, WA, WV, DC |
| **Early Expansion (2015-2019)** | Adopted within five years of ACA | AK, IN, LA, ME, MT, NH, PA, VA |
| **Recent Expansion (2020-2023)** | Adopted in last three years | ID, MO, NE, NC, OK, SD, UT |
| **Pending/Partial** | Not fully implemented | GA, KS |
| **Non-Expansion** | No expansion adopted | AL, FL, MS, SC, TN, TX, WI, WY |

Expansion timing affects RHTP implementation capacity. **Recent expansion states** built coverage infrastructure assuming 90% federal support. Enhanced FMAP reduction to 70% by 2031 creates fiscal exposure that **did not exist when expansion was approved**. North Carolina (expanded December 2023) exemplifies this vulnerability.

## Part II: Coverage Gap Analysis

### Coverage Gap Population by State

The coverage gap exists in states that have not expanded Medicaid. Adults with incomes above state Medicaid eligibility thresholds but below 100% of the Federal Poverty Level are **ineligible for both Medicaid and ACA Marketplace subsidies**.

| State | Coverage Gap Population | % of National Gap | Rural Concentration |
|-------|------------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Texas** | 580,000 | 42% | High (border, rural regions) |
| **Florida** | 260,000 | 19% | Moderate |
| **Georgia** | 190,000 | 14% | High (Black Belt, rural South) |
| **Tennessee** | 85,000 | 6% | High (Appalachia, rural West TN) |
| **Alabama** | 75,000 | 5% | High (Black Belt, rural) |
| **Mississippi** | 65,000 | 5% | Very High (Delta, Black Belt) |
| **South Carolina** | 55,000 | 4% | High (rural Lowcountry, Pee Dee) |
| **Wyoming** | 10,000 | <1% | Very High (frontier) |
| **Wisconsin** | 0 | 0% | N/A (waiver provides coverage to 100% FPL) |
| **Total** | ~1,400,000 | 100% | Disproportionately rural |

**Source:** KFF analysis of American Community Survey data, February 2025

### Coverage Gap Demographic Profile

| Characteristic | Coverage Gap Population | General Population |
|----------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| **People of Color** | 64% | 44% |
| **Working Adults** | 60%+ in working families | N/A |
| **Adults Without Children** | 80% | N/A |
| **Rural Residents** | Disproportionately high | N/A |
| **Self-Employed** | Disproportionately high | N/A |

**Texas, Florida, and Georgia account for 75% of the national coverage gap population.** These three states contain large rural populations where RHTP investment occurs alongside persistent coverage gaps that transformation funding cannot address.

## Part III: RHTP and Medicaid Cut Interaction

### The Fundamental Mismatch

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act created RHTP and cut Medicaid simultaneously. Multiple analyses quantify the gap between cuts and investment:

| Analysis Source | Rural Medicaid Reduction (10-year) | RHTP Investment (5-year) | Gap |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------|-----|
| **KFF** | $137 to $155 billion | $50 billion | $87 to $105 billion |
| **Manatt/NRHA** | $58 billion (hospitals only) | $50 billion | $8 billion minimum |
| **AHA** | $50.4 billion (hospitals only) | $50 billion | Effectively zero offset |
| **Center for American Progress** | Variable by facility | $4.5M per hospital (if equal) | Facility-level losses exceed RHTP |

**The arithmetic does not work.** NRHA's Carrie Cochran-McClain stated: "When you put that up against the $50 billion for the Rural Health Transformation Fund, you know, that math does not add up."

### Timing Mismatch

The gap analysis understates the problem because **RHTP front-loads funding while Medicaid cuts back-load impact**.

| Period | RHTP Status | Medicaid Cut Status |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|
| **FY2026-2030** | $10 billion annually distributed | Work requirements phase in FY2027; per capita caps tighten |
| **Post-FY2030** | RHTP ends | 64% of ten-year Medicaid reductions occur after FY2030 |
| **FY2031+** | No transformation funding | FMAP reduction to 70% fully implemented; steepest cuts arrive |

States receive temporary RHTP support before permanent Medicaid austerity arrives.

### FMAP Reduction Schedule

The enhanced Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) for Medicaid expansion populations decreases from 90% to 70% over five years:

| Fiscal Year | Federal Match for Expansion Adults |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Current (FY2025) | 90% |
| FY2027 | 85% |
| FY2028 | 80% |
| FY2029 | 75% |
| FY2030 | 72% |
| FY2031+ | 70% |

The **20-percentage-point reduction shifts billions in costs to states**. States must either increase state spending to maintain coverage or reduce enrollment and benefits. Given state budget constraints, coverage reduction is the likely outcome in most states.

## Part IV: Medicaid Gap Classification Schema

### Classification Definitions

The Medicaid Gap measures the difference between projected Medicaid spending reductions and RHTP allocations at the state level. Classification considers both absolute gap size and state fiscal capacity.

| Classification | Definition | Fiscal Implications |
|----------------|------------|---------------------|
| **Positive** | RHTP meets or exceeds annualized Medicaid cuts | Transformation proceeds without Medicaid offset pressure |
| **Low** | Gap under $500M annually | Manageable with state resources; transformation viable |
| **Moderate** | Gap $500M to $2B annually | Significant strain; triage decisions required |
| **Severe** | Gap $2B to $5B annually | Critical infrastructure threat; coverage contraction likely |
| **Extreme** | Gap over $5B annually | Systemic collapse risk; RHTP insufficient for basic maintenance |

### State Classifications

| Classification | States | Characteristics |
|----------------|--------|-----------------|
| **Positive** | AK, VT, ND, SD, WY | Small populations, favorable RHTP formula treatment, limited Medicaid dependency |
| **Low** | WV, OK, MT | Expansion states with moderate populations; RHTP provides meaningful buffer |
| **Moderate** | KY, AR, NC, MO, LA, OH, IN, MI, WI, MN, IA, NE, KS, CO, UT, NM, NV, OR, WA, ID, ME, NH, RI, CT, DE, MD, VA, HI | Expansion states with significant rural populations; FMAP reduction creates fiscal pressure but coverage infrastructure exists |
| **Severe** | MS, GA, TN, AL, SC | Non-expansion status (except GA partial); hospital closure rates among highest nationally; persistent poverty concentration |
| **Extreme** | TX, CA, NY, PA, IL, FL | Large rural populations, high Medicaid enrollment, significant provider tax reliance; scale magnifies gap |

### State Detail: Medicaid Gap Classification

| State | RHTP FY2026 | Medicaid Gap Class | Expansion Status | Coverage Gap Pop. | Hospital Risk |
|-------|-------------|--------------------|-----------------|--------------------|---------------|
| **Texas** | $281.3M | Extreme | Non-Expansion | 580,000 | 82 (54%) |
| **California** | $233.6M | Extreme | Expansion | N/A | Moderate |
| **New York** | $212.1M | Extreme | Expansion | N/A | Moderate |
| **Pennsylvania** | $193.3M | Extreme | Expansion | N/A | Moderate |
| **Illinois** | $193.4M | Extreme | Expansion | N/A | Moderate |
| **Florida** | $209.9M | Extreme | Non-Expansion | 260,000 | Moderate |
| **Mississippi** | $205.9M | Severe | Non-Expansion | 65,000 | 28 (49%) |
| **Georgia** | $218.9M | Severe | Partial (work req.) | 190,000 | 22 (30%) |
| **Tennessee** | $206.9M | Severe | Non-Expansion | 85,000 | 16 (44%) |
| **Alabama** | $203.4M | Severe | Non-Expansion | 75,000 | Moderate |
| **South Carolina** | $200.0M | Severe | Non-Expansion | 55,000 | 31-40% |
| **Kentucky** | $212.9M | Moderate | Expansion (2014) | N/A | Moderate |
| **Arkansas** | $208.8M | Moderate | Expansion (2014) | N/A | 50% at risk |
| **North Carolina** | $213.0M | Moderate | Expansion (2023) | N/A | 12 closures |
| **Ohio** | $202.0M | Moderate | Expansion (2014) | N/A | Moderate |
| **Missouri** | $216.3M | Moderate | Expansion (2021) | N/A | 10 closures |
| **Louisiana** | $208.4M | Moderate | Expansion (2016) | N/A | Moderate |
| **Oklahoma** | $223.5M | Low | Expansion (2021) | N/A | 23 (34%) |
| **West Virginia** | $199.5M | Low | Expansion (2014) | N/A | 5 closures |
| **Montana** | $233.5M | Low | Expansion (2016) | N/A | Low |
| **Alaska** | $272.2M | Positive | Expansion (2015) | N/A | Low |
| **Vermont** | $195.1M | Positive | Expansion (2014) | N/A | Low |
| **North Dakota** | $198.9M | Positive | Expansion (2014) | N/A | Low |
| **South Dakota** | $189.5M | Positive | Expansion (2023) | N/A | 26-30% |
| **Wyoming** | $205.0M | Positive | Non-Expansion | 10,000 | Low |

## Part V: Per-Capita Medicaid Spending Baseline

### State Medicaid Spending Context

State Medicaid per-enrollee spending provides baseline for understanding RHTP investment proportionality:

| Spending Tier | States | Per-Enrollee Spending | RHTP Implication |
|---------------|--------|----------------------|------------------|
| **High** | AK, NY, CT, MA, VT, ND | $12,000+ | RHTP supplements robust existing system |
| **Above Average** | CA, NJ, NH, MN, WY, RI | $9,000 to $12,000 | Transformation builds on adequate base |
| **Average** | PA, IL, OH, MI, WA, OR, CO | $7,000 to $9,000 | RHTP addresses moderate gaps |
| **Below Average** | TX, FL, GA, NC, VA, AZ | $5,500 to $7,000 | RHTP cannot offset underfunding |
| **Low** | AL, MS, TN, SC, AR, LA | Under $5,500 | RHTP insufficient for baseline adequacy |

**States with low Medicaid per-enrollee spending often have both coverage gaps and inadequate provider reimbursement.** RHTP investment in these states faces compounding structural disadvantages.

## Part VI: Provider Financial Exposure

### Rural Hospital Medicaid Revenue Dependency

Rural hospitals depend on Medicaid revenue at varying rates, creating differential exposure to cuts:

| Dependency Level | Definition | Risk Profile |
|------------------|------------|--------------|
| **Critical** | >40% of net patient revenue from Medicaid | Extreme closure risk under cuts |
| **High** | 30-40% Medicaid revenue | Severe financial stress likely |
| **Moderate** | 20-30% Medicaid revenue | Significant but survivable with transformation |
| **Low** | <20% Medicaid revenue | Manageable exposure; RHTP can focus on transformation |

### Exposure by State Type

| State Category | Typical Hospital Medicaid Dependency | Cut Impact |
|----------------|-------------------------------------|------------|
| **Non-Expansion States** | 15-25% (lower enrollment) | High uncompensated care; closures accelerate |
| **Recent Expansion States** | 25-35% (building enrollment) | FMAP reduction creates fiscal cliff |
| **Established Expansion States** | 30-40% (mature enrollment) | Gradual cost shift to states |

**Non-expansion states present a paradox.** Lower Medicaid dependency appears protective, but high uncompensated care burdens create equivalent or greater financial stress. Hospitals in non-expansion states already experience higher closure rates despite lower Medicaid revenue percentages.

### Critical Access Hospital Exposure

Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs) face particular vulnerability:

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| CAHs with negative margins | 47% | HRSA FY2024 |
| CAHs at financial risk | 432 nationwide | Chartis 2025 |
| Average CAH Medicaid margin | Negative $200,000 to $500,000 | Rural hospital analysis |

**Medicaid pays less than cost at most CAHs.** Unlike Medicare cost-based reimbursement, Medicaid rates vary by state and typically reimburse 60-80% of actual costs. Cuts to already inadequate payments compound losses.

## Part VII: State Classifications for Analytical Use

### Classification Schema Application

The following schema enables consistent state classification across Series 3 articles:

| Dimension | Categories | Application |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| **Expansion Status** | Full, Partial, Limited, Non-Expansion | Determines coverage gap presence |
| **Expansion Timing** | Original, Early, Recent, Pending, None | Affects infrastructure maturity |
| **Medicaid Gap Class** | Positive, Low, Moderate, Severe, Extreme | Primary risk stratification |
| **Coverage Gap Population** | None, Small (<50K), Moderate (50-150K), Large (>150K) | Quantifies uninsured burden |
| **Provider Exposure** | Low, Moderate, High, Critical | Financial vulnerability assessment |

### State Profile Template

Each Series 3 state profile should document:

**Medicaid Context Block**
```
Expansion Status: [Full/Partial/Limited/Non-Expansion]
Expansion Date: [Year or N/A]
Medicaid Gap Classification: [Positive/Low/Moderate/Severe/Extreme]
Coverage Gap Population: [Number or N/A]
Enhanced FMAP Exposure: [Yes/No/Partial]
Provider Medicaid Dependency: [Percentage range]
```

### Cross-Reference Matrix

| Medicaid Gap Class | Typical Expansion Status | Coverage Gap | RHTP Strategy Implication |
|--------------------|-------------------------|--------------|---------------------------|
| **Positive** | Expansion | None | Transformation focused; adequate resources |
| **Low** | Expansion | None | Transformation with buffer; sustainability achievable |
| **Moderate** | Expansion | None | Triage required; social care vulnerable |
| **Severe** | Mixed | Large | Coverage advocacy essential; RHTP insufficient |
| **Extreme** | Mixed | Varies | Crisis management; transformation secondary |

## Part VIII: Projected Coverage Loss Estimates

### Work Requirements Impact

CBO estimates **7.5 million people** will lose Medicaid coverage by 2034 due to work requirements. Rural areas face disproportionate impact:

| Barrier | Rural Prevalence | Expected Impact |
|---------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Documentation challenges** | High (agricultural, gig work) | Higher disenrollment rates |
| **Seasonal employment** | High (farming, tourism) | Compliance gaps during off-seasons |
| **Transportation barriers** | High (no public transit) | Inability to reach verification appointments |
| **Childcare unavailability** | High | Cannot work without childcare |

### Coverage Loss Projections by State Category

| State Category | Projected Coverage Loss | RHTP Offset Capacity |
|----------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| **Non-Expansion** | N/A (no expansion population) | None (coverage gap persists) |
| **Recent Expansion** | 15-25% of expansion population | Minimal; FMAP reduction compounds |
| **Established Expansion** | 10-20% of expansion population | Limited; administrative churning |

### AHA Rural Coverage Projection

The American Hospital Association projects **1.8 million rural residents** will lose coverage by 2034 under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. This population loss compounds provider financial exposure, creating demand reduction during revenue contraction.

- Provider exposure percentages represent ranges; facility-level variation is significant
- Projected coverage losses depend on work requirement implementation details not yet finalized

**Formula limitations include:**
- RHTP-to-Medicaid gap ratio does not account for non-Medicaid revenue sources
- Per-capita calculations use varying rural population definitions across sources
- Hospital risk classifications use different methodologies by source

### Update Schedule

This document requires revision when:
