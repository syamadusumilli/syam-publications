On December 29, 2025, Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced that Arkansas would receive **$208.8 million in fiscal year 2026** through the Rural Health Transformation Program. This award places Arkansas ninth nationally in RHTP allocation, above the national average of $200 million, and reflects the severity of the state's rural health crisis. Arkansas has the **highest percentage of rural hospitals vulnerable to closure in the nation** at 50%, according to Chartis 2025 data. Half of Arkansas's rural hospitals could close.

Yet Arkansas presents a paradox that defies the standard rural health collapse narrative. Despite having the worst hospital vulnerability rate in America, **only one rural hospital has closed in Arkansas since 2014**. De Queen Medical Center shuttered and was replaced by Sevier County Medical Center. During the same period, 59 rural hospitals closed in six surrounding states that did not expand Medicaid. Texas alone lost 26. Missouri lost 13. Oklahoma lost 10. Arkansas lost one.

The difference is Medicaid expansion. Arkansas expanded coverage in 2014 through its unique **Arkansas Health and Opportunity for Me (ARHOME)** program, which uses a private option model to cover adults up to 138% of the federal poverty level. That expansion reduced uncompensated care costs at rural hospitals, improved operating margins, and prevented the cascade of closures that devastated neighboring states.

Now the policy that saved Arkansas's rural hospitals is under threat. The **One Big Beautiful Bill Act of 2025** imposes $911 billion in Medicaid cuts over ten years, introduces work requirements beginning January 2027, and phases down the enhanced federal matching rate for expansion populations. Arkansas will receive approximately **$1 billion in RHTP funding over five years** if its application is fully funded. It faces an estimated **$155 billion in reduced federal Medicaid spending** over the same decade. The math does not reconcile.

Arkansas is not applying for RHTP funding because its hospitals are closing. Arkansas is applying for RHTP funding because the policy protection that kept hospitals open is being dismantled, and $1 billion over five years cannot replace what Medicaid expansion provided.

## The Baseline Crisis

Arkansas's rural health crisis is measured not by what has collapsed but by what remains vulnerable. The state's rural health infrastructure has survived the past decade primarily because Medicaid expansion provided financial stability that neighboring states' hospitals lacked. That stability is fragile, and the underlying conditions remain severe.

**Fifty percent of Arkansas's rural hospitals are vulnerable to closure**, the highest rate in the nation. Chartis 2025 data shows that 30 of 47 rural hospitals with inpatient services operate under financial stress that places them at risk. Eleven hospitals face **immediate closure risk**, defined as facilities unable to sustain losses for more than two to three years. These hospitals have exhausted reserves and cannot absorb further revenue declines without shuttering or converting to non-inpatient models.

The vulnerability is not theoretical. These hospitals serve communities where the nearest alternative may be 50 miles away. When a rural hospital closes, emergency services disappear. Labor and delivery units vanish. Specialty care becomes unavailable. The community loses not just healthcare but often its largest employer and anchor institution.

**Arkansas's rural health infrastructure includes 5 Critical Access Hospitals, 5 Rural Emergency Hospitals, 149 Rural Health Clinics, 163 Federally Qualified Health Center sites, and approximately 20 short-term or prospective payment system hospitals in rural areas.** This network provides care to 1.3 million rural Arkansans, approximately 41% of the state's population, living in 54 of 75 counties classified as rural. The Arkansas Center for Health Improvement notes that nearly half of Arkansans live in rural areas, where residents face less access to healthcare, worse outcomes, and more fragile health systems than urban populations.

The **Arkansas Delta presents the most acute crisis within the crisis**. Fourteen Delta counties qualify as areas of persistent poverty with persistent child poverty. Counties like Desha, Lee, Phillips, Monroe, Chicot, Crittenden, St. Francis, and Columbia rank among the least healthy in the United States. Life expectancy in Mississippi County is 71.5 years, more than four years below the national average. Infant mortality in the Delta exceeds 8 per 1,000 live births compared to 7.2 per 1,000 in urban Arkansas. Maternal mortality rates in Delta counties exceed state averages that already rank among the worst nationally.

Economic decline has accelerated population exodus from the Delta, leaving behind older, sicker, poorer residents with fewer healthcare options. Between 2010 and 2024, multiple Delta counties lost 10% or more of their population. Young people leave for educational and employment opportunities in Little Rock, Northwest Arkansas, or out of state. Those who remain are disproportionately elderly, disabled, or tied to the region by family obligations.

The Delta's challenges are structural and generational. Agricultural mechanization eliminated jobs decades ago. Manufacturing never replaced farming at comparable scale. Major employers that once anchored communities have closed or relocated. The tax base erodes as property values decline and population shrinks. School districts consolidate or struggle for accreditation. Churches that once served as community centers lose membership. The social fabric that supports health frays.

Hospitals in the Delta serve populations unable to pay for care and unable to fund local government supplements that sustain public facilities elsewhere. Self-pay rates are high. Medicare and Medicaid dominate payer mix, and both reimburse below cost. The RHTP cannot reverse Delta economic decline. It cannot restore population. It cannot rebuild tax bases. It can only attempt to sustain healthcare access for those who remain in communities that have been declining for generations.

**Workforce shortages compound infrastructure fragility across the state.** More than 60% of Health Professional Shortage Areas nationally are in rural locations, and Arkansas concentrates its limited physician workforce in Little Rock, Fayetteville, and a handful of regional centers. Rural counties face severe shortages in primary care, mental health, dental care, and specialty services. The Arkansas Department of Health has pursued Health Professional Shortage Area designations for additional counties to enable loan repayment and recruitment programs, but designations alone do not produce providers.

Rural surgeon shortages are particularly acute. As the existing workforce ages, replacements are not available. Medical school graduates face $200,000 or more in debt and choose urban practices with higher salaries, better working conditions, and professional advancement opportunities. Rural hospitals cannot compete on compensation, and loan repayment programs cover only a fraction of debt.

**Health outcomes in Arkansas rank among the worst in America.** The 2025 America's Health Rankings report places Arkansas **49th nationally**, down one position from 48th in 2024. Arkansas previously ranked 49th in 1998, 2013, and 2014. The state has never ranked higher than 40th, achieved in 1993 and 2009.

The data is unambiguous:
- **Cardiovascular disease death rate**: 231 per 100,000, third highest nationally
- **Diabetes death rate**: 30 per 100,000, third highest nationally
- **Obesity prevalence**: 37% of adults, among the highest nationally
- **Smoking rate**: Third highest nationally
- **Life expectancy**: Approximately 72.5 years, 3.2 years below the national average

Arkansas scores below the national average on 37 of 55 measures tracked by America's Health Rankings and better than average on only 14. The state's performance on clinical care, health behaviors, and social and economic factors clusters with Mississippi, Louisiana, and West Virginia at the bottom of national rankings.

**Cost barriers prevent Arkansans from seeking care even when it is available.** The percentage of adults who reported avoiding healthcare due to cost rose from 11.7% in 2021 to **15.3% in 2024**, a 31% increase. In rural counties, this figure exceeds 20%. Seasonal flu vaccination rates dropped from 43.1% in 2022 to 38% in 2024, a 12% decline. Preventive care and chronic disease management suffer when cost prevents people from seeing providers.

These trends matter for RHTP implementation. Federal funding can build clinics and train providers, but funding cannot force patients to seek care they perceive as unaffordable. Arkansas's RHTP plan must address not only supply constraints but also demand barriers rooted in economic hardship.

## The Funding Reality

Arkansas's RHTP award of **$208,779,396 for fiscal year 2026** places the state ninth nationally in allocation and above the national average. The state's application requested approximately **$1 billion over five years**, distributed as roughly $200 million annual payments from 2026 through 2031. Actual five-year funding depends on continued federal appropriations and compliance with program requirements.

On a per capita basis, Arkansas will receive approximately **$161 per rural resident in fiscal year 2026** and roughly **$770 per rural resident over five years** if the full request is funded. This exceeds the national average per capita allocation, reflecting Arkansas's high rural population share and poor health outcomes, both factors in the RHTP allocation formula.

The funding is substantial. It is also insufficient.

Arkansas's RHTP application proposes **four major initiatives** totaling approximately $1 billion:

**HEART (Healthy Eating, Active Recreation, and Transformation)** requests approximately **$150 million** for community-driven approaches to nutrition, physical activity, and chronic disease management. HEART integrates school programs, faith-based organizations, community initiatives, and healthcare education. A **$10 million component** specifically funds school-based clinics and mobile care units. The initiative addresses chronic disease through prevention and lifestyle modification rather than clinical intervention.

**PACT (Promoting Access Coordination and Transformation)** is the largest initiative at approximately **$393 to $400 million**. PACT focuses on specialty care integration, preventive screenings, telehealth expansion, and trauma-ready services in rural communities. The initiative emphasizes **Clinically Integrated Networks (CINs)** to improve data sharing and regional collaboration among providers. Budget components include:
- $125 million for specialty, preventive, and telehealth service expansion
- $125 million for hospital acquisitions, partnerships, and facility upgrades
- $110 million to develop CINs
- $25 million for expanding practice authority for healthcare professionals

**RISE (Recruitment Innovation Skills and Education for Arkansas)** requests approximately **$161.5 million** for workforce development. RISE expands residencies, increases medical school rotation slots, develops clinical training programs, and creates recruitment and retention incentives. Budget components include:
- $70.25 million for residency programs and scholarships
- $67 million for recruitment and retention incentives
- $16.3 million for career advancement programs for nurses and other professionals

**THRIVE (Telehealth Health Monitoring and Response Innovation for Vital Expansion)** focuses on technology infrastructure, patient-centered artificial intelligence applications, evidence-based prevention programs, and data collection and analytics. THRIVE's budget is embedded across other initiatives rather than separately specified.

All four initiatives emphasize technology integration and alignment with **Make America Healthy Again** priorities, including prevention, chronic disease management, and community-based care models.

The funding will flow through the **Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration**, with the governor's office providing overall coordination. Stakeholder engagement during the application process included an online portal that collected more than 300 proposals from physicians, nurses, pharmacists, hospitals, higher education institutions, and nonprofits. The Arkansas General Assembly received briefings but did not control application content.

**The per-facility math reveals the challenge.** If $209 million in FY2026 were distributed equally among Arkansas's approximately 47 rural hospitals with inpatient services, each would receive less than $4.5 million. Actual distribution will prioritize certain hospitals and programs over others, meaning some facilities will receive substantial support while others receive little. The 11 hospitals at immediate closure risk cannot all be rescued with available funds. Choices must be made.

## The Fiscal Context

Arkansas's Medicaid expansion through **ARHOME** covers approximately **231,000 Arkansans** as of December 2024, down from a peak of 342,000. Total Medicaid enrollment exceeds **821,000 Arkansans**, representing nearly one in three residents. In rural Arkansas, **41% of Medicaid enrollees** live in communities served by vulnerable hospitals. Medicaid is the financial foundation of rural healthcare in Arkansas.

The Medicaid expansion prevented rural hospital collapse. Between 2014 and 2025, while 59 rural hospitals closed in six surrounding non-expansion states, Arkansas lost only one. The Arkansas Advocate reports that 42 of those closures occurred in three states bordering Arkansas that did not expand Medicaid: Texas, Missouri, and Oklahoma. The causal mechanism is straightforward. Expansion reduced uncompensated care by providing coverage to previously uninsured patients. Hospital operating margins improved. Facilities that would have closed remained open.

Now that protection faces systematic erosion.

The **One Big Beautiful Bill Act of 2025** imposes **$911 billion in Medicaid cuts** over ten years. These cuts include:
- **Work requirements** beginning January 2027, potentially as early as January 2026 in states that choose earlier implementation
- **Reduced federal matching rates** for expansion populations
- **More frequent eligibility redeterminations** every six months instead of annually
- **Reduced retroactive coverage** from 90 days to 60 days
- **Out-of-pocket costs** for certain services beginning October 2028

Arkansas has experience with Medicaid work requirements. In 2018, Arkansas became the first state to implement work requirements for Medicaid expansion enrollees. The Arkansas Works program required adults ages 30 to 49 to report 80 hours per month of work, job training, education, or other qualifying activities. Compliance reporting was initially available only through an online portal, despite limited internet access in rural areas. Within seven months, **18,000 Arkansans lost coverage**, many for administrative reasons rather than failure to work. Research published in the New England Journal of Medicine found **no increase in employment** among the affected population. The requirements were struck down by federal courts in 2019, and coverage was restored.

The new federal work requirements differ in important ways. They are statutory rather than administratively imposed, meaning courts cannot strike them down on the same grounds. They apply to adults ages 19 to 64 with exceptions for pregnant women, people with disabilities, caregivers, and other specified categories. Implementation begins January 2027 at the federal level, though states may implement earlier. Arkansas may choose to implement in January 2026.

**Projected coverage losses under the new requirements are severe.** Estimates suggest **114,000 Arkansans**, approximately 14% of current Medicaid enrollment, could lose coverage through the combined effects of work requirements, more frequent eligibility redeterminations, and reduced retroactive coverage. Rural residents face disproportionate risk because work requirements are harder to satisfy in areas with limited employment options, transportation challenges, unreliable internet access for reporting compliance, and seasonal or irregular work patterns common in agriculture and related industries.

The experience of 2018 provides a preview. Administrative complexity causes coverage losses even among eligible individuals. Reporting requirements create barriers. Appeals processes are slow. By the time coverage is restored, medical debt has accumulated, chronic conditions have worsened, and trust in the system has eroded.

The Medicaid cuts create a fiscal trap. Arkansas cannot use RHTP funding to backfill Medicaid revenue losses because the program explicitly prohibits such use. Rural hospitals will lose Medicaid revenue. RHTP funding must be used for transformation initiatives, not operating support. The net effect is hospitals receiving transformation funding while losing the Medicaid revenue that keeps them operational.

**The comparative math is stark.** Arkansas will receive approximately **$1 billion in RHTP funding over five years**. Arkansas faces an estimated **$155 billion reduction in federal Medicaid spending** over ten years, with cuts accelerating in 2029 when enhanced matching rates phase down. Even assuming conservative estimates, annual Medicaid cuts will exceed annual RHTP funding within three years of the transformation program's launch.

This is not a criticism of RHTP as policy. The program provides meaningful resources for health system transformation. It is an observation that **transformation cannot proceed while the financial foundation erodes faster than new supports can be constructed.** Arkansas is being asked to transform a system while the policy that stabilized it is being withdrawn.

## Politics and Policy

Arkansas presents a politically complex environment for rural health policy. The state expanded Medicaid under a Democratic governor in 2014 but has been governed by Republicans since 2015. **Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders** leads the RHTP application effort, positioning Arkansas as aligned with Trump administration health priorities while maintaining the Medicaid expansion her Republican predecessors preserved.

**The ARHOME private option model distinguishes Arkansas from other expansion states.** Rather than enrolling expansion adults directly in Medicaid managed care, Arkansas uses federal Medicaid dollars to purchase private health insurance through the marketplace. This approach, conceived as a conservative alternative to traditional expansion, has survived multiple legislative attempts to terminate it. The private option model may provide political cover as federal changes are implemented, but it does not insulate Arkansas from federal matching rate reductions or work requirement mandates.

**Sanders has aligned Arkansas with Make America Healthy Again priorities** through actions that earned RHTP scoring points:
- **SNAP restrictions**: Arkansas banned the use of SNAP benefits to purchase soft drinks and candy in 2025
- **School nutrition**: Senate Bill 59 requires free breakfast for all students
- **Farm-to-school pilot program**: Promotes local food sourcing
- **Physical fitness emphasis**: Natural State Initiative promotes outdoor recreation
- **Cell phone restrictions**: Bell-to-bell ban in schools reduces screen time

These policies reflect genuine commitment to health improvement and strategic positioning for federal funding. Whether commitment persists after RHTP scoring is complete remains to be seen. Critics argue that SNAP restrictions stigmatize low-income families and reduce food security without demonstrated health benefits. Supporters argue public programs should promote health rather than subsidize products contributing to chronic disease.

**Scope of practice reforms remain limited.** Arkansas restricts independent practice by nurse practitioners and physician assistants, requiring physician supervision even in areas without physicians. Expanding scope of practice could partially address workforce shortages, but organized medicine opposes such changes, and legislative reforms have not advanced. The RHTP application includes $25 million for expanding practice authority, suggesting the state may pursue administrative or legislative changes, but political opposition is formidable.

**Legislative oversight of RHTP implementation is evolving.** The governor's office controls the application and implementation process, with the Department of Finance and Administration serving as lead agency. Arkansas General Assembly members received briefings and provided input through the stakeholder portal but did not shape the application. As funding flows, lawmakers holding appropriation authority may demand greater transparency and input into subaward decisions.

The governance structure concentrates authority in the executive branch. This enables decisive action but creates accountability risks. If implementation falters, responsibility rests with the governor's office. If lawmakers feel excluded, they may resist complementary appropriations or impose reporting requirements that complicate execution.

## What Arkansas Must Do

The RHTP provides Arkansas with resources to address urgent rural health needs, but funding is time-limited, constrained by federal guidelines, and insufficient to solve all problems. Arkansas must prioritize.

**Workforce pipelines must be expanded and retention incentives created.** Arkansas cannot recruit enough physicians, nurses, and allied health professionals from outside the state. National shortages limit external supply. Arkansas must grow its own workforce through residency expansion, scholarship programs, and career pathways that begin in high school. The RISE initiative's **$161.5 million** targets this need, but success requires that trainees remain in Arkansas after completing programs. Retention incentives are as important as recruitment.

**Clinically Integrated Networks must become operational.** The PACT initiative's **$110 million for CIN development** represents Arkansas's bet on regional coordination. CINs enable data sharing, care coordination, and resource alignment across hospitals, clinics, and specialty providers. But networks require trust, governance structures, and sustained commitment from participants. Historical rivalries between providers, competition for patients, and resistance to transparency create barriers. CINs that exist on paper but do not function in practice waste resources.

**Technology infrastructure must enable telehealth expansion.** Rural Arkansas lacks the broadband connectivity and interoperable health IT systems necessary for telehealth to function at scale. The THRIVE initiative focuses on technology, but telehealth requires more than equipment. It requires training, workflow redesign, provider acceptance, and patient trust. Technology is necessary but not sufficient.

**Prevention and chronic disease management must reduce demand for acute care.** Arkansas's chronic disease burden drives hospitalizations, emergency visits, and healthcare costs. The HEART initiative's **$150 million** targets prevention through community-based approaches including school programs, faith organization partnerships, and nutrition initiatives. Prevention programs take years to show results. Chronic disease accumulated over decades does not reverse in five years. But prevention investment that reduces future demand may be the only sustainable path when acute care capacity is constrained.

**Hospital stabilization must be strategic, not comprehensive.** Arkansas cannot save all 30 vulnerable rural hospitals with available RHTP funding. Choices are necessary. Some hospitals may receive substantial support. Others may receive assistance converting to Rural Emergency Hospital status or merging with regional systems. Some may close despite RHTP investment if operating losses exceed available resources. Triage is unpleasant but unavoidable.

**Social care integration must connect clinical services with community resources.** Health outcomes reflect social conditions. Housing instability, food insecurity, transportation barriers, and social isolation drive health needs that clinical care alone cannot address. Arkansas's RHTP application emphasizes community-based initiatives, but the plan does not prominently feature social determinants of health screening, community health worker programs, or community information exchange platforms that other states have prioritized. Whether social care integration survives constrained funding remains uncertain.

## Conclusion

Arkansas will receive $208.8 million in fiscal year 2026, the first installment of approximately $1 billion over five years, to transform a rural health system where half the hospitals are vulnerable to closure, where health outcomes rank 49th nationally, and where the Medicaid expansion that prevented hospital collapse is being systematically dismantled.

This is the Arkansas paradox. **The state expanded Medicaid and prevented hospital closures that devastated neighboring states.** Arkansas's reward is federal policy that phases down expansion funding, imposes work requirements that will cause coverage losses, and offers transformation funding that cannot replace lost Medicaid revenue.

Arkansas is not Mississippi. Arkansas expanded Medicaid. Arkansas kept hospitals open. Arkansas demonstrated that policy choices matter, that coverage expansion stabilizes rural health infrastructure, that prevention works. Now Arkansas faces the unwinding of those policy choices while being offered transformation funding as compensation for lost protection.

The $1 billion over five years cannot offset $155 billion in Medicaid spending reductions over a decade. The RHTP can fund workforce development, technology infrastructure, and care coordination networks. It cannot replace the operating revenue that Medicaid expansion provides to vulnerable hospitals.

What happens next depends on choices. Will Arkansas use RHTP funding strategically, building systems that can survive the post-2030 funding cliff and the post-expansion coverage decline? Or will Arkansas distribute funding reactively, attempting to stabilize every vulnerable hospital rather than making difficult triage decisions?

Will the state supplement federal investment with state resources, or will Arkansas rely entirely on federal dollars while accepting the constraints imposed by federal policy changes? Will workforce initiatives produce providers who stay in Arkansas, or will training investments benefit other states?

Will Arkansas demonstrate that transformation is possible even as the policy foundation erodes, or will the state become an example of why transformation funding cannot substitute for coverage expansion?

These are the questions that will determine whether rural Arkansans in 2031 have reliable access to healthcare or whether the infrastructure preserved by Medicaid expansion finally collapses under the weight of its withdrawal.

Part 2 of this analysis examines Arkansas's four-initiative RHTP plan: what the state proposes to build with $209 million, how HEART, PACT, RISE, and THRIVE translate intent into implementation, and whether the strategic bet Arkansas is making can possibly succeed.
