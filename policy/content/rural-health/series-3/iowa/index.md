Iowa received **$209 million in FY2026 RHTP funding**, positioning the state above the national average of $200 million despite lacking the rural population scale of states like Texas or California. This favorable outcome reflects both Iowa's dense Critical Access Hospital network and the strength of its Healthy Hometowns application, which Governor Kim Reynolds called "an incredible opportunity to advance health care in rural Iowa."

The state's five-year projected total of **approximately $1 billion** represents unprecedented investment in a healthcare infrastructure defined by 82 Critical Access Hospitals spread across 99 counties. Iowa operates the **second-highest CAH count in the nation** after Texas, making it a laboratory for whether federal rural health investment can sustain the small hospital model that communities depend upon but economics increasingly threaten.

## Rural Health Landscape

### State Context

Iowa spans **56,273 square miles** across 99 counties, with approximately **1.2 million rural residents** comprising roughly 37% of the state's 3.2 million population. Unlike states where rural populations concentrate in specific regions, Iowa's rural character distributes evenly across most of the state, with only the Des Moines, Cedar Rapids, and Iowa City metropolitan areas representing substantial urban concentration.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Population | 3.2 million |
| Rural Population | ~1.2 million |
| Percentage Rural | 37% |
| Total Counties | 99 |
| Counties Under 20,000 | 64 |
| Counties Under 5,000 | 2 |

Sixty-four of Iowa's 99 counties have fewer than 20,000 residents. Ten counties exceed 65,000 population, creating a bifurcated geography: metropolitan growth corridors experiencing population gains while rural counties face persistent decline. Henry County recorded the steepest population drop at 11.3% since 2020, while several small counties including Adams and Osceola lost more than 6% of their residents.

The population distribution creates healthcare infrastructure challenges distinct from frontier states like Montana or Wyoming. Iowa's rural communities are not isolated by hundreds of miles of empty territory. Rather, they face the paradox of proximity: close enough to metropolitan centers that specialty services concentrate there, yet far enough that access requires substantial travel for populations aging faster than urban counterparts.

### Healthcare Infrastructure

Iowa maintains one of the most extensive Critical Access Hospital networks nationally:

| Facility Type | Count | Notes |
|---------------|-------|-------|
| Critical Access Hospitals | 82 | Second highest nationally |
| Rural Health Clinics | 100+ | Primary care access points |
| FQHCs and Satellites | 15+ | Safety net providers |
| Total Hospitals | 118 | Including urban facilities |

The **82 Critical Access Hospitals** represent a density that few states match relative to population. These facilities serve communities where the nearest alternative care often lies 30 or more miles distant across secondary roads. Eleven Iowa CAHs received recognition in the **2025 Chartis Top 100 Critical Access Hospitals** list, demonstrating quality alongside quantity.

Notable Iowa CAHs with national recognition include:
- **Cass Health** in Atlantic
- **Franklin General Hospital** in Hampton
- **Hegg Memorial Health Center** in Rock Valley
- **Myrtue Medical Center** in Harlan
- **UnityPoint Health Jones Regional Medical Center** in Anamosa
- **CHI Health Mercy Corning**

Iowa's Flex Program supports all 82 CAHs through quality improvement, financial improvement, and operational improvement activities. The **Iowa Healthcare Collaborative** and **HomeTown Health** serve as technical assistance providers, offering education and strategies for hospital operations, workforce, and financial sustainability.

### Health Professional Shortages

Iowa's workforce gaps reveal systemic challenges that RHTP investment must address:

| Designation Type | Affected Counties/Population |
|------------------|------------------------------|
| Primary Care HPSA | 59 of 99 counties |
| Population in HPSA | 1.85 million (60% of state) |
| Maternal Care Target Areas | All Primary Care HPSA counties |

**Sixty percent of Iowa's population** lives in designated Health Professional Shortage Areas. This figure exceeds what rural population percentages would predict, indicating shortages extend into semi-urban communities surrounding metropolitan areas. The 2022 addition of Maternal Care Target Area designations to all Primary Care HPSAs highlighted obstetric workforce gaps that force many rural Iowa women to travel significant distances for prenatal and delivery care.

Iowa ranks in the **bottom 20% of states** for general pediatricians per 100,000 children. The shortage of developmental specialists to assess and treat children with Autism Spectrum Disorder and serious emotional disorders creates multi-month waiting lists that families in rural areas cannot easily navigate.

### Agricultural Economy Context

Iowa's economic structure shapes health outcomes distinctly from other rural states. The agricultural economy generates prosperity through commodity production, food processing, and biosciences. Unemployment consistently runs below national averages, reaching 2.8% in 2024. Median household income stands at $73,482, approaching national levels.

Yet this relative economic health masks disparities. Rural counties show significantly lower income levels than urban counterparts. Agricultural work carries occupational hazards including exposure to chemicals, machinery accidents, and respiratory conditions from grain dust and animal confinement operations. Seasonal variations in agricultural employment create insurance coverage gaps for workers transitioning between farm and non-farm jobs.

The state's 10.99% poverty rate, while below national averages, concentrates in rural communities where limited transportation options compound economic disadvantage. Access to care requires vehicle ownership in regions where public transit does not exist.

## RHTP Award and Context

| Metric | Iowa | National Average |
|--------|------|------------------|
| FY2026 Award | $209 million | $200 million |
| Five-Year Projected Total | ~$1 billion | ~$1 billion |
| Rural Population | ~1.2 million | Varies |
| Per-Capita (Rural) | ~$174 | ~$150 |
| Award Rank | Above Average | N/A |
| CAH Count | 82 | 28 average |

Iowa's above-average award reflects multiple formula factors working in the state's favor. The **82 Critical Access Hospitals** generate scoring weight under the provision addressing "situation of hospitals" in rural areas. The application's emphasis on cancer prevention and hub-and-spoke care delivery aligned with CMS priorities for evidence-based interventions.

### Formula Position

Iowa benefits modestly from RHTP's allocation structure:
- **50% equal distribution:** $100 million baseline regardless of rural population
- **50% workload factors:** $109 million based on rurality metrics and application scoring

The $109 million workload allocation positions Iowa slightly above median. States with larger rural populations (Texas, California) received more absolute dollars but lower per-capita amounts. States with smaller populations but extreme rurality (Montana, Wyoming, Alaska) received higher per-capita funding. Iowa occupies the middle ground: substantial rural population, extensive hospital infrastructure, competitive application.

**Per-capita funding of approximately $174** per rural resident exceeds the national average but falls short of frontier states receiving $300 or more. This positions Iowa to invest meaningfully across its CAH network without the per-facility intensity possible in states with fewer hospitals and more concentrated funding.

### Medicaid Expansion Status

**Iowa expanded Medicaid** through the Affordable Care Act, initially via a waiver creating the Iowa Health and Wellness Plan (IHAWP) in 2014, transitioning to straight expansion in 2015 with managed care delivery. As of December 2024, **180,879 Iowans** receive coverage through ACA Medicaid expansion, with total Medicaid/CHIP enrollment exceeding 669,000.

However, Iowa's Medicaid landscape faces substantial uncertainty. The state has pursued **work requirements** for expansion populations, with legislation signed in 2025 requiring 80 hours of monthly employment for non-exempt adults. Federal waiver approval remains pending, and implementation targets January 2026. The legislation includes provisions to discontinue IHAWP entirely if federal approval for work requirements is subsequently revoked.

Projected coverage losses under work requirements could reach **32,000 Iowans**, with phased disenrollment beginning in calendar year 2026. This policy trajectory creates tension with RHTP goals: rural providers may gain RHTP revenue while simultaneously losing Medicaid patients whose coverage depends on work requirement compliance.

**Medicaid Cut Exposure:** Iowa's rural hospitals face compounding pressures from projected federal Medicaid reductions under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. While RHTP provides $1 billion over five years, Kaiser Family Foundation projects rural Medicaid losses of $137 billion nationally over the same period. Iowa's share of these cuts, combined with potential state-level coverage reductions from work requirements, could offset transformation gains.

## State Approach

### Governance and Lead Agency

The **Iowa Department of Health and Human Services** serves as lead agency and primary recipient of RHTP funds. HHS Director Larry Johnson oversees implementation with stated mission of achieving "healthier communities and better outcomes."

The Healthy Hometowns application involved stakeholder engagement including webinars, listening sessions, and collaboration with the Iowa Hospital Association and Iowa Healthcare Collaborative. Implementation will engage a technical assistance vendor to host both in-person and virtual collaboration sessions connecting state staff and policymakers with feedback from rural healthcare providers.

### Strategic Framework: Healthy Hometowns

Iowa's **Healthy Hometowns** strategy organizes around five interconnected initiatives designed to strengthen rural healthcare delivery while building sustainable infrastructure beyond 2030. The approach prioritizes formal partnerships between facilities, addressing cancer as a demonstrable population health target, and extending care delivery through mobile and telehealth technologies.

Governor Reynolds' 2025 rural health care law provided legislative foundation for several Healthy Hometowns components, including hub-and-spoke networks and residency positions at teaching hospitals. RHTP funding operationalizes statutory intent that predated the federal program.

### Core Initiatives

**Initiative 1: Hometown Connections**

The flagship initiative builds formal partnerships to restructure healthcare delivery options for rural communities. Iowa will allocate up to **$20 million annually** for individual Health Hub projects creating hub-and-spoke networks where primary and preventive care remains close to home while specialized services connect through formal referral relationships.

Key components include:
- **Centers of Excellence expansion** building on Governor Reynolds' existing program
- **Health Hubs** pairing hospitals to solve access, revenue, and sustainability problems
- **Best and Brightest** sub-initiative for workforce recruitment and retention
- **School-based services** targeting the 42% of Iowa students attending rural schools

Performance metrics track Centers of Excellence launching new services and hiring positions including OB navigators, midwives, and mental health providers. Equipment procurement and telehealth substitution rates provide early indicators before outcome data matures.

**Initiative 2: Combat Cancer**

Iowa's cancer initiative addresses rising rates through comprehensive prevention, screening, and treatment strategies:

| Cancer Focus | Intervention Approach |
|--------------|----------------------|
| Lung Cancer | Radon testing and mitigation |
| Breast Cancer | Mammograms and follow-up MRIs |
| Colorectal Cancer | FIT tests and follow-up colonoscopies |
| Skin Cancer | Telehealth and new equipment |
| Prostate Cancer | Routine screening methods |

The initiative creates **cancer-specific Health Hubs** with upgraded equipment and specialized workforce. Family support services address the non-clinical burden cancer places on rural households where travel for treatment compounds emotional and financial stress.

Cancer screening via health kiosks in community settings represents Iowa's approach to reaching populations who may not engage traditional healthcare settings. This aligns with broader RHTP themes of meeting patients where they are rather than requiring them to navigate distant facilities.

**Initiative 3: Communities of Care**

This initiative supports **co-location of different provider types** for convenient patient access and improved coordination. Rather than requiring patients to visit separate facilities for primary care, behavioral health, dental, and social services, Communities of Care sites bring providers together under one roof.

Key elements include:
- **Community health workers** as system navigators
- Chronic disease prevention and management programs
- Enhanced services integrating with Health Hub referral networks
- Nutrition counseling and social care navigation

The community health worker component represents Iowa's explicit SDOH strategy. CHWs assist with scheduling, service navigation, specialist referrals, and connecting patients to community resources addressing non-medical needs affecting health outcomes.

**Initiative 4: Health Information Exchange**

Iowa will invest in expanding the **Iowa Health Information Network (IHIN)**, the state's official statewide HIE, to ensure records are accessible as patients travel throughout new Health Hubs and seek care in new ways.

IHIN operates through partnership with Nebraska's NEHII, forming a regional health data utility serving both states. This existing infrastructure provides foundation for RHTP investment rather than requiring ground-up platform development. The HIE initiative focuses on extending connectivity to facilities not yet connected and enhancing interoperability between disparate systems.

**Initiative 5: EMS Community Care Mobile**

The mobile health initiative addresses maternal health transportation and community-based care delivery:

- **High-risk maternal transport telehealth** for mothers and newborns requiring higher levels of care
- **Mobile integrated healthcare** bringing prenatal, postpartum, and chronic disease management to homes and community sites
- Post-surgery discharge support delivered through mobile teams

This initiative acknowledges that traditional facility-based care models fail rural populations facing transportation barriers. Rather than expecting patients to reach facilities, mobile services bring care to communities.

## Program and Funding Distribution

| Program | Estimated Allocation | Implementing Organization | Focus |
|---------|---------------------|--------------------------|-------|
| Hometown Connections | $20M annually | Iowa HHS + Hospital Partners | Hub-and-spoke networks, workforce |
| Centers of Excellence | $15M+ | Designated hospitals | Specialty service expansion |
| Best and Brightest | $10M+ | Iowa HHS | Workforce recruitment and retention |
| Combat Cancer | $25M+ | Iowa HHS + Cancer Health Hubs | Screening, treatment, prevention |
| Communities of Care | $15M+ | Co-location sites | Provider integration, CHWs |
| Health Information Exchange | $10M+ | IHIN/CyncHealth Iowa | Statewide HIE expansion |
| EMS Community Care Mobile | $15M+ | EMS agencies, hospitals | Mobile health, maternal transport |

*Allocations are estimates based on application priorities; final distributions subject to implementation planning.*

### Key Subawardees

Implementation will flow through multiple organizational channels:

**Iowa Hospital Association** brings advocacy and coordination capacity across the 118-hospital membership, with particular strength in CAH engagement through longstanding Flex Program relationships.

**Iowa Healthcare Collaborative** provides quality improvement technical assistance and data analytics supporting MBQIP reporting and performance monitoring.

**HomeTown Health** delivers financial and operational improvement education, particularly valuable for CAHs facing margin pressure.

**Iowa Health Information Network (IHIN)/CyncHealth Iowa** operates the statewide HIE infrastructure that underpins the Health Information Exchange initiative.

**Technical Assistance Vendors** (to be procured) will host stakeholder collaboration sessions and connect policy makers with provider feedback.

**Centers of Excellence Hospitals** will receive direct investment for service expansion and workforce positions.

## Social Care Integration

| Component | Included in Plan | Funding | Vendor/Operator | Likely Funded? |
|-----------|------------------|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| SDOH/HRSN | Yes | Embedded in Communities of Care | Co-location sites | At Risk |
| CHW Programs | Yes | Embedded | Communities of Care sites | Yes |
| CIE Platform | Partial | Via HIE expansion | IHIN/CyncHealth | Yes |
| Screening Infrastructure | Limited | Not separately funded | Provider-level | At Risk |

### SDOH/HRSN Approach

Iowa's application integrates social determinants screening and navigation within the Communities of Care initiative rather than establishing standalone SDOH infrastructure. Community health workers serve as navigators connecting patients to services, but explicit HRSN (Health-Related Social Needs) screening requirements and closed-loop referral tracking receive limited emphasis.

The state operates **Unite Iowa**, a community information exchange platform administered through the IHIN/CyncHealth partnership with Unite Us. This existing infrastructure provides technical capability for social care coordination that RHTP investment could strengthen, though the application does not prominently feature CIE expansion as a distinct priority.

### CHW Deployment

Community health workers appear explicitly in the Communities of Care initiative, deployed at co-location sites to assist with:
- Scheduling coordination across multiple provider types
- Service navigation for complex care needs
- Specialist referrals within Health Hub networks
- Nutrition counseling
- Social care connection

The CHW model assumes co-location sites as the deployment context. Rural areas without co-location infrastructure may not receive CHW coverage, potentially leaving the most isolated communities without navigation support.

### Social Care Survival Assessment

**SDOH Screening:** At risk. No dedicated screening infrastructure investment. Screening occurs at provider discretion within Communities of Care sites.

**HRSN Navigation:** Partially funded. CHW deployment provides navigation capacity at co-location sites. Coverage gaps likely in areas without co-location investment.

**CHW Programs:** Likely funded. Explicit inclusion in Communities of Care initiative with defined roles.

**CIE Platform:** Operational via Unite Iowa. RHTP does not appear to prioritize CIE expansion, but existing infrastructure provides foundation.

## Assessment

### Strengths

**CAH Network Density:** Iowa's 82 Critical Access Hospitals provide unmatched infrastructure for transformation investment. Where other states must decide which few facilities receive support, Iowa can pursue network-wide approaches leveraging existing relationships between facilities.

**Hub-and-Spoke Experience:** Governor Reynolds' Centers of Excellence program predates RHTP, providing tested models for formal partnerships between facilities. Healthy Hometowns builds on proven concepts rather than theorizing new approaches.

**Cancer Focus Specificity:** The Combat Cancer initiative targets a measurable population health outcome with evidence-based interventions. Screening rates, detection stages, and survival outcomes provide concrete metrics unavailable for vaguer "transformation" goals.

**HIE Infrastructure:** IHIN's partnership with Nebraska's NEHII creates regional health data utility infrastructure that other states lack. RHTP can enhance rather than build this capability.

**Workforce Pipeline Legislation:** Iowa's 2025 rural health law created residency positions at teaching hospitals specifically aimed at rural recruitment. RHTP funds operationalize statutory commitments already in place.

**School-Based Strategy:** Targeting the 42% of Iowa students in rural schools addresses population health upstream where intervention potential is highest. School-based services reach families who may not engage adult-focused healthcare settings.

### Vulnerabilities

**Work Requirement Uncertainty:** Iowa's pending Medicaid work requirements could remove 32,000 people from coverage beginning in 2026, the same year RHTP implementation launches. Providers may gain transformation funding while losing patients.

**Coverage Contingency:** Legislation directing IHAWP discontinuation if federal work requirement approval is revoked creates scenario where Iowa's expanded Medicaid population could lose coverage entirely. RHTP transformation assumes coverage exists to access transformed services.

**Co-location Concentration:** The Communities of Care model requires provider co-location that may not extend to the most isolated rural communities. CHW deployment follows co-location sites, potentially leaving dispersed populations without navigation support.

**Social Care Gaps:** Despite Unite Iowa CIE infrastructure, the Healthy Hometowns application does not prominently feature SDOH screening requirements or closed-loop referral expansion. Social care integration depends on provider-level implementation rather than systematic requirements.

**Per-Capita Limitations:** At $174 per rural resident, Iowa cannot invest as intensively per community as frontier states receiving $300 or more. The 82-CAH network disperses funding that other states concentrate.

### The 2030 Question

Iowa's Healthy Hometowns explicitly addresses sustainability, but fundamental questions remain:

Can hub-and-spoke partnerships generate efficiency gains sufficient to survive without ongoing federal subsidy?

Will workforce recruited through Best and Brightest remain in rural communities after initial service commitments expire?

Does cancer screening infrastructure create permanent capacity or temporary capacity dependent on RHTP operating funds?

**Critical dependency:** Iowa's sustainability prospects hinge substantially on Medicaid policy decisions that may reduce covered populations during the transformation period. Building infrastructure for patients who subsequently lose coverage inverts the transformation logic.

### The Medicaid Math

Iowa faces particularly complex interaction between RHTP investment and Medicaid cuts:

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| RHTP Five-Year Investment | +$1 billion |
| Projected Medicaid Cuts (State Share) | Varies by federal formula |
| Work Requirement Coverage Loss | -32,000 potential |
| Potential IHAWP Discontinuation | -181,000 if triggered |

RHTP cannot offset coverage losses of the magnitude Iowa's policy trajectory contemplates. If work requirements proceed and 32,000 lose coverage, transformation investments serve populations that shrink rather than stabilize. If federal approval is revoked and IHAWP ends entirely, 181,000 Iowans would lose Medicaid coverage while RHTP continues funding infrastructure to serve them.

This is not hypothetical risk. Iowa has enacted legislation, sought federal waivers, and expressed willingness to end expansion coverage rather than operate without work requirements. RHTP implementation planning must account for scenarios where the insured rural population declines substantially during the grant period.

## Conclusion

Iowa's $209 million FY2026 award validates a well-crafted application leveraging the state's exceptional CAH infrastructure and building on existing Centers of Excellence foundations. The **Healthy Hometowns strategy** addresses workforce, cancer outcomes, care coordination, and health information exchange through initiatives that reinforce rather than duplicate each other.

The challenge is context. Iowa operates in a policy environment where Medicaid expansion faces existential threat from state-level work requirements and contingent discontinuation provisions. Building hub-and-spoke networks for populations that may lose coverage during the transformation period inverts the program's logic.

For Iowa's 1.2 million rural residents, RHTP represents unprecedented federal commitment delivered through a state application that prioritized practical initiatives over aspirational rhetoric. **Whether that commitment proves sufficient depends on Medicaid policy decisions that could either complement transformation or undermine its foundation.**

The 82 Critical Access Hospitals that distinguish Iowa's rural health landscape will receive network-wide investment unavailable to states with fewer facilities. Whether those facilities can translate RHTP funding into sustainable operations beyond 2030 depends less on the quality of Healthy Hometowns initiatives than on whether Iowans retain coverage to access the care those facilities provide.

Iowa has a plan built on the state's distinctive CAH density and Governor Reynolds' existing rural health priorities. The question is whether policy choices unrelated to RHTP will determine outcomes more than the transformation investments themselves.
