Part 1 established the baseline: **$199.5 million for approximately 1.1 million rural West Virginians** translates to $181 per person annually, among the highest per capita allocations in the nation. Fifteen rural hospitals face closure risk. Six face immediate closure within three years. West Virginia leads the nation in deaths from cancer, drug overdose, diabetes, and kidney disease. Life expectancy dropped nearly two years in 2021. The workforce participation rate ranks near the bottom nationally, and **poor health is the primary reason West Virginians cite for not working**.

West Virginia responded with seven flagship initiatives under Governor Patrick Morrisey's **Health to Prosperity** vision, a framework that positions health improvement as the prerequisite for economic revival. The application, developed with assistance from **McKinsey and Company** at a cost of $2 million, received endorsement from more than **40 healthcare organizations** and incorporated feedback from more than **17,000 residents** who participated in a statewide tele-townhall.

The strategic approach reflects West Virginia's unique position as the only state located entirely within Appalachia, where nearly the entire population qualifies as rural and where health challenges compound across generations. Unlike larger states that must allocate resources across diverse regional needs, West Virginia can concentrate investment on a smaller population facing concentrated crisis. Whether this concentration of need and investment produces transformation or merely delays decline depends on implementation choices that begin now.

**The central premise**: health improvement drives workforce participation, workforce participation drives economic revival, and economic revival creates the sustainable tax base necessary to maintain health systems beyond RHTP's five-year window. This circular logic requires each component to function for any component to succeed.

## The Strategic Framework

### Governance Structure

The **West Virginia Department of Health (WVDOH)** serves as lead agency for all RHTP implementation. Governor Morrisey designated the Department of Health rather than the Department of Health and Human Resources, reflecting organizational restructuring that separated public health functions from human services administration. **Dr. Arvin Singh**, Secretary of Health, bears primary responsibility for program direction and outcomes.

Within days of the December 29, 2025 award announcement, Dr. Singh announced the Department was actively recruiting leadership for the Rural Health Transformation Program. The recruitment call emphasized seeking physicians, nurses, administrators, and leaders with experience in health systems transformation.

| Role | Function |
|------|----------|
| Secretary of Health (Dr. Arvin Singh) | Program authority, strategic direction, CMS liaison |
| RHTP Director (to be appointed) | Day-to-day management, initiative coordination |
| Initiative Leads | Subject-matter experts for each of seven initiatives |
| Regional Coordinators | Stakeholder engagement across geographic zones |
| Grants Management | Subaward administration, compliance monitoring |
| Data and Evaluation | Performance tracking, annual reporting |

The governance structure centralizes authority within the Department of Health while allowing for distributed implementation through subawards. The state indicated funding will flow through **a mix of competitive grants and direct state agency awards**, suggesting some initiatives will use procurement processes while others will direct funds to established partners.

### Theory of Change

The West Virginia application operates on an **integrated transformation theory** that connects healthcare improvement to economic recovery. The logic model:

1. **Health barriers drive workforce nonparticipation.** Poor health, chronic disease, substance use disorder, and disability are the primary reasons West Virginians cite for not working. Addressing these barriers requires accessible healthcare.

2. **Healthcare requires access infrastructure.** Rural West Virginians cannot reach care due to geographic isolation, transportation barriers, and provider shortages. The Connected Care Grid and Rural Health Link address access barriers directly.

3. **Access requires workforce.** No technology can replace the need for healthcare providers. The Mountain State Care Force builds the pipeline of physicians, nurses, and allied health professionals the state needs.

4. **Sustainability requires payment reform.** Fee-for-service payment perpetuates volume over value. Smart Care Catalyst equips providers with tools and incentives to shift toward value-based models that reward outcomes.

5. **Prevention reduces treatment burden.** The chronic diseases devastating West Virginia are largely preventable through lifestyle modification. The Personal Health Accelerator invests in upstream prevention aligned with Governor Morrisey's four-pillar health initiative and federal **Make America Healthy Again (MAHA)** priorities.

6. **Recovery enables productivity.** The Health to Prosperity Pipeline explicitly connects substance use disorder recovery, care management, and employment support, treating recovery as the pathway to workforce participation.

7. **Innovation creates opportunity.** HealthTech Appalachia positions West Virginia as a hub for rural health innovation, creating economic activity and potentially attracting investment and talent.

The theory's vulnerabilities include the **timeline mismatch** between five-year RHTP funding and the decade-long investments required for workforce development, the **Medicaid offset problem** where projected $6.6 billion in cuts over ten years may overwhelm $1 billion in transformation investment, and the assumption that **improved health translates to employment** in a state where job opportunities themselves remain limited.

### Core Initiatives and Interrelationships

The seven initiatives form a conceptual ecosystem, though implementation reality will test whether theoretical integration holds:

**Access Layer**
- Connected Care Grid provides virtual and mobile care delivery
- Rural Health Link solves transportation barriers to physical care sites

**Workforce Layer**
- Mountain State Care Force builds provider pipeline
- Health to Prosperity Pipeline connects recovery to employment

**Technology Layer**
- Smart Care Catalyst modernizes provider operations
- HealthTech Appalachia incubates innovation

**Prevention Layer**
- Personal Health Accelerator addresses chronic disease upstream

Each initiative depends on others for full effect. Telehealth without workforce produces virtual waiting rooms. Transportation without destination providers moves patients to facilities that cannot serve them. Workforce without sustainable payment models produces providers who leave for better-compensated positions elsewhere. The plan requires coordinated execution across all seven initiatives, a significant implementation challenge for a state agency building program capacity from scratch.

**Total: $199,476,099 (FY2026)**

## Initiative 1: Connected Care Grid

### Design and Mechanics

The flagship access initiative builds infrastructure to bring care to people rather than requiring people to travel to care. West Virginia's mountainous terrain, winding roads, and dispersed population make traditional facility-based care delivery inherently inefficient. The Connected Care Grid addresses this through four integrated components:

**Telehealth Expansion**: Video consultation capacity extended to rural hospitals, clinics, FQHCs, and community access points. The initiative builds on existing telehealth infrastructure developed during COVID-19 while addressing persistent broadband gaps that limit connectivity in the most remote communities. Integration with WVU Medicine and Marshall Health telehealth networks extends specialist access to rural sites.

**Remote Patient Monitoring**: Home-based devices transmitting vital signs, blood glucose, weight, oxygen saturation, and other metrics to care teams. Targets patients with chronic conditions including diabetes, heart failure, COPD, and hypertension, enabling intervention before acute episodes require emergency care or hospitalization. The CHW-based chronic care management model developed in Mingo County provides a template for integrating remote monitoring with community health worker support.

**Mobile Care Units**: Vehicles equipped for clinical service delivery traveling to underserved communities on scheduled routes. Mobile units bring primary care, dental services, behavioral health, and screening programs to communities lacking fixed facilities. Coordination with EMS and transportation networks ensures mobile units complement rather than duplicate other services.

**EMS Treatment-in-Place**: Expands the role of paramedics and EMTs to provide **community paramedicine** and **mobile integrated healthcare (MIH)** services. Rather than transporting all 911 callers to emergency departments, trained EMS personnel can assess patients at home, provide treatment, and connect them to appropriate care resources. The West Virginia Office of Emergency Medical Services has supported MIH/CP training through Mountwest Community and Technical College, providing the foundation for expanded deployment.

### Target Population and Geography

The initiative prioritizes **communities with the greatest access barriers** while acknowledging infrastructure prerequisites:

| Priority | Population | Access Challenge |
|----------|------------|------------------|
| Highest | Southern coalfields (McDowell, Mingo, Logan, Wyoming) | Extreme isolation, population decline, hospital closures |
| High | Central Appalachian counties | Distance to specialists, limited broadband |
| High | Eastern Panhandle communities | Growing population outpacing infrastructure |
| Moderate | Northern Panhandle | Better access but aging facilities |
| Moderate | Areas with existing broadband | Technology deployment feasible |

**Broadband constraints** remain significant. Deployment of telehealth and remote monitoring requires connectivity that does not exist in portions of rural West Virginia. The initiative must coordinate with BEAD Program broadband buildout timelines, potentially sequencing deployments to match infrastructure availability.

### Funding Allocation

**Estimated: $45-55 million (FY2026)**

| Component | Allocation | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| Telehealth infrastructure | $15-18M | Equipment, platform licensing, installation |
| Remote monitoring programs | $12-15M | Devices, monitoring infrastructure, care coordination |
| Mobile care units | $8-10M | Vehicles, equipment, staffing support |
| EMS treatment-in-place | $6-8M | Training, protocols, equipment, medical direction |

| Expansion | Q4 2026-Q2 2027 | Scaled deployment across additional sites |
| Optimization | Ongoing | Performance monitoring, continuous improvement |

## Initiative 2: Rural Health Link

### Design and Mechanics

Transportation is cited as a barrier to care in virtually every assessment of West Virginia's rural health challenges. Patients miss appointments because rides do not arrive. Dialysis patients requiring three-times-weekly treatment travel hours on mountain roads. Pregnant women in southern counties may travel 60 or more miles for prenatal care. Rural Health Link creates **unified health mobility infrastructure** addressing these barriers.

**One-Stop Scheduling Platform**: A single point of access connecting patients to all available transportation resources. Currently, patients must navigate separately among non-emergency medical transportation (NEMT) through Medicaid, public transit where available, community ride programs, volunteer driver networks, and informal family support. The platform integrates these resources into a unified system allowing patients to schedule rides through one interface.

**Vehicle and Driver Grants**: Competitive awards to expand local and regional transportation capacity. Grant recipients may include county transit authorities, community action agencies, faith-based organizations, and other entities with transportation infrastructure that can be expanded for health-related trips.

**Data-Driven Coordination**: Integration with EMS dispatch, hospital discharge planning, and clinic scheduling to optimize routing and reduce costs. The platform captures transportation demand data enabling better resource allocation and identification of underserved areas.

### Target Population

**Primary beneficiaries** include:
- Medicaid enrollees using NEMT benefits

## Initiative 3: Mountain State Care Force

### Design and Mechanics

West Virginia faces **severe workforce shortages** across primary care, mental health, dental health, nursing, and allied health professions. Most rural counties carry Health Professional Shortage Area designations. The Mountain State Care Force addresses shortages through recruitment, training, and retention strategies:

**Rural Residency Expansion**: Increased training positions in family medicine, internal medicine, psychiatry, and other specialties at rural sites. Physicians who train in rural areas are more likely to practice in rural areas. The initiative expands graduate medical education capacity beyond Charleston and Morgantown.

**Loan Forgiveness Programs**: Building on existing programs including West Virginia Higher Education Policy Commission's $40,000 loan forgiveness for medical students committing to rural practice. RHTP funding expands eligibility and increases award amounts.

**Return-to-Home Scholarships**: In-state tuition for out-of-state students who commit to equal years of rural practice in West Virginia, implementing **HB 4768** passed in 2024. The initiative provides additional support beyond tuition including living expenses and training costs.

**Learn and Earn Apprenticeships**: Entry-level healthcare jobs through community college partnerships creating pathways for West Virginians to enter healthcare careers without relocating for extended education.

**Community Health Worker Expansion**: Training and employment support for CHWs who provide culturally appropriate outreach, navigation, and care coordination. West Virginia has existing CHW infrastructure through the **WVSOM Center for Rural and Community Health CHERP program** and Marshall University's CHW training.

### Target Professions

## Social Care Integration

### SDOH/HRSN Initiatives

West Virginia's RHTP application incorporates **social determinants of health** addressing across multiple initiatives rather than as a standalone program:

**Screening Requirements**: The Connected Care Grid includes social needs screening as part of telehealth and mobile care encounters. Digital intake tools capture housing, food, transportation, and safety data.

**Navigation and Coordination**: CHW expansion under Mountain State Care Force provides navigation capacity. Community health workers connect patients to social services and community resources. The CHW-based chronic care management model developed in Mingo County demonstrates this approach.

**Resource Connection**: Integration with **WVU Medicine's findhelp platform** enables patient self-referral to community resources. Findhelp's network of 605,700+ program locations provides directory infrastructure.

| SDOH Component | Status in WV Application |
|----------------|-------------------------|
| Screening requirements | Included (via Connected Care Grid) |
| Navigation infrastructure | Included (via CHW expansion) |
| Social needs data capture | Included (via technology initiatives) |
| Closed-loop referral | Partial (findhelp integration) |
| Resource directory | Existing (findhelp) |

### Community Health Worker Programs

West Virginia has established CHW infrastructure that RHTP will expand:

**WVSOM CHERP Program**: The West Virginia School of Osteopathic Medicine Center for Rural and Community Health offers **Community Health Education Resource Person (CHERP)** training, a three-level curriculum preparing community members to provide health education, outreach, and navigation. Training is available online and in-person across West Virginia.

**Marshall University Training**: Marshall provides standardized CHW training and continuing education services supporting the chronic care management model that demonstrated significant outcomes in Appalachian communities.

**Medicaid CHW Reimbursement**: West Virginia has pursued Medicaid reimbursement for CHW services through managed care arrangements. The **Drug Free Mom and Baby Program** uses CHWs to support individuals with opioid use disorder during pregnancy and postpartum.

## Budget Flow and Timeline

### FY2026 Allocation Across Initiatives

| Initiative | Estimated Allocation | % of Total |
|------------|---------------------|------------|
| Connected Care Grid | $45-55M | 23-28% |
| Mountain State Care Force | $35-45M | 18-23% |
| Smart Care Catalyst | $25-32M | 13-16% |
| Personal Health Accelerator | $22-30M | 11-15% |
| Rural Health Link | $20-28M | 10-14% |
| Health to Prosperity Pipeline | $18-25M | 9-13% |
| HealthTech Appalachia | $10-15M | 5-8% |
| Program Administration | $12-16M | 6-8% |

### Two-Year Obligation Requirement

RHTP statute requires states to obligate at least **two-thirds of each annual award within two fiscal years**. For West Virginia's FY2026 award:
- **$133 million** must be obligated by September 30, 2027
- Remaining funds must be obligated within the five-year program period

This requirement pressures rapid procurement while maintaining quality control.

### Performance Monitoring

| Metric Category | Examples |
|-----------------|----------|
| Access | Telehealth encounters, transportation trips completed |
| Workforce | Training completions, placement rates, retention |
| Technology | Sites equipped, EHR adoption, interoperability |
| Prevention | Screening rates, chronic disease indicators |
| Recovery | Employment rates, coverage transitions |
| Financial | Obligation rates, subawardee performance |

## What the Plan Assumes

### Explicit Assumptions in State Application

- Health improvement drives workforce participation
- Technology can extend provider capacity
- Prevention reduces long-term costs
- Workforce pipelines can be accelerated
- Value-based care models are financially sustainable
- Federal funding continues for five years
- Annual re-scoring rewards demonstrated progress

### Implicit Assumptions Not Stated

- Broadband infrastructure arrives on compatible timelines
- Medicaid cuts do not overwhelm transformation gains
- Hospitals at risk of closure survive long enough to participate
- Workforce pipeline graduates remain in West Virginia
- Employers exist to hire recovered and healthy workers
- State budget constraints do not limit match requirements
- Political support continues across administration changes

### Dependencies on External Factors

| Dependency | Risk if Unmet |
|------------|---------------|
| BEAD broadband buildout | Telehealth deployment delays |
| Medicaid funding stability | Hospital closures, coverage losses |
| Labor market demand | Employment outcomes limited |
| Federal policy consistency | Re-scoring criteria changes |
| State fiscal capacity | Sustainability after RHTP |

### Risks Acknowledged Versus Ignored

**Acknowledged**:
- Workforce shortages require long-term investment
- Transportation barriers are complex
- Technology alone insufficient
- Chronic disease requires lifestyle change

**Not Acknowledged**:
- Medicaid cuts may exceed transformation benefits
- Hospital closures may accelerate despite investment
- Employment depends on job availability, not just health
- Five-year timeline insufficient for generational change

## Conclusion

West Virginia's RHTP application represents the most ambitious attempt in state history to **transform health from a barrier to an asset**. The Health to Prosperity vision correctly identifies the circular relationship between poor health, workforce nonparticipation, and economic stagnation. The seven initiatives address real barriers: geographic isolation, provider shortages, transportation gaps, chronic disease burden, substance use disorder, outdated technology, and limited innovation capacity.

The plan builds on existing infrastructure including WVU Medicine's findhelp integration, WVSOM's CHERP CHW training, Marshall University's chronic care management model, and emerging community paramedicine capacity. It leverages West Virginia's concentrated rural population to direct resources toward a defined geography rather than spreading thin across diverse regions.

**The fundamental question is whether $199 million annually can accomplish what the plan envisions while Medicaid cuts extract $6.6 billion over the same decade.** The math does not reconcile. Hospitals already operating on negative margins will face accelerating losses regardless of technology upgrades. Coverage losses will reduce patient volume and revenue. Workforce pipeline graduates will face employment in a system under financial stress.

Part 3 of this analysis examines what works, what struggles, and what survives under the resource constraints West Virginia faces. The seven initiatives represent what the state can build with what it received. Whether what it received is sufficient to accomplish what it promised remains the essential question.
