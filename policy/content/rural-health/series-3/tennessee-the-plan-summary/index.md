Tennessee received $206.9 million for 2.4 million rural residents, translating to $86 per person annually, ranking the state in the lower third of per-capita allocations despite operating the highest rural hospital closure rate per capita in the nation. Sixteen rural communities lost inpatient care since 2010. Forty-four percent of remaining rural hospitals face closure risk. The coverage gap traps 250,000 to 300,000 Tennesseans between Medicaid eligibility and marketplace subsidies, creating a fundamental constraint on any transformation strategy. East Tennessee operates under the Ballad Health monopoly, complicating regional coordination efforts. Against this baseline crisis, Tennessee proposed a comprehensive transformation plan organized around five strategic goals deploying seventeen interconnected initiatives.

The state's response leverages existing infrastructure through a **locally-led governance model** that decentralizes implementation authority while centralizing accountability. The Tennessee Department of Health serves as lead agency, but substantial decision-making authority flows to County Health Councils, the network of 95 local bodies charged with assessing community health needs and implementing solutions. This hub-and-spoke structure positions TDH to provide funding, technical assistance, and coordination while counties determine priorities within state frameworks. The Healthcare Resiliency Program, Tennessee's established competitive grant mechanism distributing funds to rural facilities since 2021, scales substantially under RHTP as the primary subaward vehicle. The governance structure intentionally rejects centralized state mandates in favor of community-driven priority-setting, assuming local bodies understand their own needs better than state agencies.

Tennessee's theory of change rests on five interconnected assumptions. First, **local communities possess superior knowledge** of their own health challenges, making County Health Council-driven implementation more effective than state-directed programming. Second, technology extends clinical capacity without requiring proportional workforce expansion, allowing existing providers to serve larger populations through telehealth, eConsult platforms, remote monitoring, and the Healthcare Resource Tracking System connecting clinical care to social services. Third, prevention reduces downstream costs by addressing chronic disease through nutrition, physical activity, and health-promoting environments before clinical intervention becomes necessary, aligning with the Make America Healthy Again framework. Fourth, workforce pipelines require immediate investment for returns that materialize over time, necessitating parallel deployment of Community Health Workers who provide immediate capacity while medical, nursing, and behavioral health training programs produce graduates. Fifth, regional coordination creates efficiency by reducing duplication and ensuring resources reach underserved areas through Healthcare Coalitions and Medical Operations Coordination Centers.

The theory's critical vulnerabilities emerge immediately. County Health Council capacity varies dramatically across Tennessee's 95 counties, with some councils operating sophisticated community health assessment and implementation processes while others struggle with basic organizational function. Technology prerequisites in broadband infrastructure and digital literacy remain unmet in significant portions of rural Tennessee, despite the plan's assumption that connectivity exists or will arrive through parallel federal investment. Most fundamentally, the coverage gap prevents transformed healthcare systems from serving patients who cannot afford care, limiting population health impact regardless of service delivery innovation.

The seventeen initiatives organize into five strategic goals that layer sequentially. **Goal 1: Rural Healthcare Transformation** addresses infrastructure, emergency services, EMS capacity, and regional coordination, creating the foundation enabling clinical care delivery. The Healthcare Resiliency Program Service Line Expansion receives $25-30 million to fund innovative projects expanding primary care capacity in rural hospitals, Critical Access Hospitals, and co-located clinics. Competitive grants support service line additions including behavioral health integration in primary care settings, specialty care expansion, minor renovations within existing facility footprints, clinical equipment acquisition, staffing supports tied to five-year rural service commitments, simulation-based training for high-acuity events, and telemedicine integration. All 89 rural counties qualify for HRP grants, with priority focusing on Appalachian Regional Commission and Delta Regional Authority designated distressed counties, communities lacking specific service lines, and facilities serving high proportions of TennCare members. Performance targets include ten rural primary care clinics adding integrated behavioral health access, ten adding specialty care onsite, 50 percent increase in organizations connected to Tennessee Community Compass, and ten new or upgraded exam rooms.

The **Rural Emergency Care Infrastructure** initiative receives $20-25 million for comprehensive emergency system transformation. The program funds a new ambulance in every county, addressing fleet age challenges compromising response times. Community Paramedicine programs launch in 20 high-need counties, enabling EMS personnel to provide preventive care, chronic disease management, and post-discharge follow-up rather than solely emergency transport. Neonatal Resuscitation Program training embeds perinatal readiness in rural EMS operations statewide, addressing the intersection of maternal health crisis and emergency services. Mobile behavioral health units expand through Project Rural Recovery, Tennessee's existing crisis intervention program. Regional Healthcare Coalitions build the THRIVE platform addressing persistent preparedness gaps, focusing on coalition effectiveness, system interoperability, operational readiness, supply chain resilience, and continuous quality improvement. Medical Operations Coordination Centers streamline patient movement using HL7 FHIR standards for data interoperability, creating comprehensive situational awareness during emergency response. Performance metrics specify 89 new rural ambulances, 20 counties with active Community Paramedicine, 8,000 EMS staff certified in Neonatal Resuscitation, eight regional coordination centers, and 50 coalition-led training events annually.

Tennessee's **Local Health Department Direct Services** initiative leverages the state's unparalleled network of LHDs in 89 rural counties, allocating $15-20 million for statewide sustainability planning, targeted direct services for uninsured populations, and clinical care navigation teams. Direct services include eConsults connecting primary care to specialty expertise, medication assistance through expanded on-site formularies, transportation and telehealth access support, expanded dental capacity, tobacco cessation programs, and colorectal cancer screening. Clinical Care Navigation Teams comprising approximately 21 staff embed in LHDs to connect patients to specialty care, food, housing, and social supports through Tennessee Community Compass. Performance targets include 21 navigator placements in previously unserved counties, 325 sites offering primary care services, and 10 percent annual increase in primary care patients referred for social determinant interventions. The initiative assumes LHDs can expand clinical services beyond traditional public health functions, a capacity question that varies substantially across counties with different resource bases and organizational histories.

The **Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias hub-and-spoke network** receives $8-10 million to connect specialized Memory Assessment Clinics with existing urban neuropsychiatry resources through telehealth infrastructure and trained Dementia Navigators. Memory Assessment Clinic Networks serve as diagnostic hubs while Dementia Navigators embedded in rural health departments provide post-diagnostic support and care coordination. Performance metrics specify 100 patients served per clinic by fourth quarter FY28, 30 Dementia Navigators in place, and shared IT infrastructure implemented. The model addresses geographic and workforce barriers simultaneously, allowing rural residents to access diagnostic services without multi-hour drives while supporting families through the extended trajectory of dementia care.

**Goal 2: Maternal and Child Health** receives $21-26 million across two interconnected initiatives addressing Tennessee's severe maternal health crisis. The state's maternal mortality rate ranks among the worst nationally, with rural communities experiencing particularly acute challenges as birthing facilities close and obstetric providers concentrate in urban areas. The **Building a Safer Start** initiative strengthens rural maternity care systems through Healthcare Resiliency Program MCH grants funding facility upgrades, perinatal center capacity expansion, and technology infrastructure. Rural birthing facility upgrade grants emphasize hospitals serving high proportions of TennCare births. Perinatal centers expand existing capacity, strengthen community partnerships, and implement teleconsultation supports. Technology investments include behavioral health teleconsultation for maternal and pediatric providers, TDH Call Center modernization enabling 24/7 pregnancy support, referral interoperability connecting clinical and social services, and launch of a mobile pregnancy app delivering evidence-based education and resource linkage. The Community Health Access and Navigation in Tennessee program builds on existing CHANT infrastructure by connecting pregnant and postpartum women to critical resources through comprehensive referrals and individualized care coordination with increased intensity.

Performance metrics establish ambitious targets: 100 percent of maternity care desert counties served through MCH grants, 73 percent of birthing hospitals serving rural patients actively participating in Tennessee Initiative for Perinatal Quality Care projects, 91 percent of women screened for depression postpartum, and decreased fatal overdose rate among women aged 15-44 years to 42 per 100,000. These metrics acknowledge that maternal health transformation requires simultaneous attention to clinical capacity, quality improvement, mental health integration, and substance use disorder treatment. The **Catalyzing Rural Health Value-Based Payment Models** initiative receives $6-8 million to expand alternative payment to rural hospitals, obstetric providers, and dental clinics. The Patient-Centered Obstetric Medical Home incentivizes coordinated maternal care and postpartum follow-up. The Rural Hospital VBP Capacity Program provides infrastructure funding helping hospitals meet quality benchmarks and succeed under the TennCare Hospital Investment Program.
