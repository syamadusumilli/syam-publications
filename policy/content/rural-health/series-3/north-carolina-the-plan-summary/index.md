North Carolina proposes to spend $213 million in federal Rural Health Transformation Program funding on a fundamentally different implementation model than most states receiving RHTP awards. Rather than distributing funds to individual providers or creating standalone programs, the state bets on regional coordination infrastructure through six hubs called NC ROOTS, standing for Rural Organizations Orchestrating Transformation for Sustainability. These hubs will align with the state's existing Medicaid managed care regions, serving 85 of North Carolina's 100 counties and operating as the coordination mechanism for all other transformation activities. The centerpiece assumption is that coordination generates efficiency impossible for isolated providers to achieve alone.

The hub model forces integration across six interconnected initiatives. Initiative 1 receives approximately $45 million for hub establishment and governance infrastructure, with Hub Leads not yet selected as of January 2026 but expected to include regional health systems, hospital consortiums, or multi-county partnerships. Initiative 2 allocates $35 million to primary care expansion, maternal health services in counties without obstetrics, chronic disease management, and nutrition programs connecting food assistance to clinical care. Initiative 3 dedicates $30 million to behavioral health integration through telehealth psychiatry expansion, substance use disorder treatment capacity in Appalachian counties with the highest opioid overdose rates, and crisis intervention teams. Initiative 4 provides $32 million for workforce development, including 8-12 new rural residency programs, 150 EMT training completions annually to address the volunteer ambulance staffing crisis, and 200 additional Community Health Worker certifications per year through the NC Community College System. Initiative 5 supports value-based payment transition with $20 million for practice transformation technical assistance, enabling rural primary care practices and Critical Access Hospitals to participate in capitation and shared savings arrangements through hub-based risk pooling. Initiative 6 deploys $40 million for technology infrastructure through the Rural Health Innovation Fund, covering telehealth equipment grants, NC HealthConnex statewide health information exchange expansion, and provider connectivity to support coordination.

The plan builds on North Carolina's existing infrastructure advantages that most RHTP recipient states lack entirely. The state operates NCCARE360, a statewide coordinated care network enabling electronic referrals between healthcare and human services with closed-loop tracking, already deployed in all 100 counties through the Foundation for Health Leadership and Innovation in partnership with Unite Us. North Carolina launched Medicaid expansion in December 2023, creating coverage levels that enable transformation activities impossible in non-expansion states. The Healthy Opportunities Pilots, beginning in 2022 across 33 counties, established the nation's first comprehensive Medicaid program paying for non-medical interventions including housing support, food delivery, transportation, and interpersonal violence services, enrolling over 30,000 Medicaid members and delivering $107 million to community organizations with interim evaluation showing $85 monthly savings per participant. The NC AHEC Program provides statewide workforce infrastructure through nine regional centers with established relationships to community colleges and health systems. The state developed standardized Community Health Worker certification through the NC Community Health Worker Association, deployed over 400 CHWs during COVID response, and integrated CHWs into Advanced Medical Home contracts under Medicaid managed care.

Social care integration receives explicit emphasis throughout the plan rather than appearing as an afterthought. All NC ROOTS hubs must implement standardized social determinants of health screening using state-developed tools deployed through NCCARE360. Hub-based navigation coordinators connect clinical referrals to community resources with closed-loop tracking. Initiative 2 nutrition programs address food insecurity identified through screening, targeting 5,000 participants in food pharmacy and produce prescription programs. Initiative 3 behavioral health services respond to social stressors documented through screening. Initiative 4 Community Health Workers serve as the navigation link between clinical and social services, with hub regions identifying CHW placement priorities and primary care practices receiving support for CHW integration. The plan explicitly proposes building on Healthy Opportunities Pilots model elements through hub-based nutrition and social care programming, even though HOP itself faces funding uncertainty with no state budget allocation scheduled for service delivery starting July 2025.

The funding flow architecture creates multiple accountability layers. CMS awards funds to NCDHHS through a cooperative agreement requiring substantial federal involvement in implementation. Funds flow initially to NCDHHS Division of Health Benefits with distribution managed through the Office of Rural Health. Intermediaries including NC AHEC, the NC Community Health Center Association, and the NC Community College System receive direct contracts from NCDHHS with specified deliverables and performance requirements, then provide pass-through funding to network providers and partners. Hub Leads will receive regional allocations based on population and need metrics, then subcontract with network participants including hospitals, primary care practices, behavioral health providers, EMS agencies, local health departments, and community-based organizations. The Rural Health Innovation Fund provides direct technology grants to eligible providers through competitive application, with awards capped per provider to ensure broad distribution. FY2026 funds become available upon cooperative agreement execution in Q1 2026 and must be obligated by September 30, 2027 under the two-year obligation requirement, creating timeline pressure as Hub Lead contracts are not expected until Q3-Q4 2026.

Subawardees span state agencies, intermediary organizations, academic partners, and direct provider awards. NC AHEC receives approximately $12 million for graduate medical education expansion and workforce training. The NC Community Health Center Association coordinates FQHC network expansion with $12 million. The NC Community College System receives $8 million for CHW and EMT training pipeline development. NC HealthConnex gets $15 million for health information exchange connectivity. The NC Division of Public Health manages $8 million for chronic disease and tobacco cessation programs. The NC Division of Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities, and Substance Use Services oversees $10 million for behavioral health program contracts. Four LME-MCOs receive $8 million for Tailored Plan integration and network development. NCCARE360 through the Foundation for Health Leadership receives $4 million for coordinated care network connectivity. Rural Health Innovation Fund direct provider grants total $20 million. Six Hub Lead organizations, once selected, will receive approximately $30 million collectively for hub governance and network management.

Performance metrics attempt to capture transformation across multiple dimensions. Hub establishment targets six operational regions by December 2027 with representative provider engagement and at least one targeted local initiative per hub by 2028. Clinical access metrics include 80 percent of rural births receiving first trimester prenatal care, chronic disease self-management enrollment increasing 25 percent, NC QuitLine rural engagement up 30 percent, and 5,000 food pharmacy enrollments. Behavioral health targets include telehealth psychiatry access in 50 percent of rural primary care practices by 2028, SUD treatment capacity increasing 20 percent, 24/7 crisis response coverage in all hub regions, and 30 rural school-based mental health pilot sites. Workforce metrics project 8-12 new rural graduate medical education programs, 150 EMT training completions annually, 200 additional CHW certifications per year, and 15 percent reduction in primary care vacancies by 2030. Value-based payment aims for 30 percent of hub network practices in VBP arrangements and 10 percent reduction in preventable hospitalizations in pilot populations by 2030.

Cross-initiative coordination depends entirely on the hub structure functioning as designed. Clinical services delivered through Initiatives 2 and 3 flow through hub network providers. Workforce trained under Initiative 4 deploys within hub regions. Payment transformation tested under Initiative 5 operates within hub populations. Technology connected through Initiative 6 enables hub infrastructure coordination. NCCARE360 serves all initiatives requiring referral and resource connection. NC HealthConnex provides the clinical data backbone. Hub governance oversees cross-initiative coordination with performance monitoring aggregated across initiative-specific metrics. This creates severe sequencing dependencies where Initiative 1 hub establishment must precede full implementation of Initiatives 2 through 5, Initiative 6 technology provides infrastructure for all other initiatives, and Initiative 4 workforce availability constrains Initiative 2 and 3 service expansion.

The plan makes explicit assumptions about cooperative agreement approval, Hub Lead identification within 6-9 months, voluntary provider participation in hub networks, scalability of existing infrastructure, value-based payment sustainability, and technology investment efficiency gains. Implicit assumptions carry more risk. The entire social care integration model depends on coverage levels enabled by Medicaid expansion, which H.R. 1 implementation threatens to unravel. The federal partnership assumes ongoing CMS technical assistance and flexibility when administration priorities could shift. Hub network participation requires providers with financial margin to invest in transformation activities, yet many rural facilities operate in distress. Social care components depend on community-based organization capacity that varies dramatically by region, with deeply rural eastern North Carolina counties facing fundamentally different challenges than urban-adjacent Piedmont counties despite both qualifying under the broadest federal rural definition. The timeline assumes five years is sufficient to build sustainable infrastructure while simultaneously delivering services, requiring execution discipline rarely achieved in complex multi-stakeholder initiatives.
