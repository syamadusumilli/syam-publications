Arkansas presents the most instructive case study in the entire Rural Health Transformation Project portfolio. The state has the **highest rural hospital vulnerability rate in the nation at 50%**, yet only one rural hospital has closed since Medicaid expansion in 2014. This paradox reveals both what policy intervention can achieve and what happens when that intervention begins to unwind.

Part 1 documented the crisis: 30 of 47 rural hospitals with inpatient services at risk, 11 at immediate closure risk, 79% operating at a loss on patient services, health outcomes ranking 49th nationally. Part 2 examined the plan: four integrated initiatives totaling approximately $1 billion over five years, emphasizing care delivery integration, technology infrastructure, workforce development, and prevention.

This analysis assesses whether the plan can succeed. Success is not binary. Partial success, where some initiatives achieve objectives while others fail, is the most likely outcome. Complete success requires assumptions that may not hold. Complete failure would require catastrophic implementation breakdown that Arkansas's governance structure should prevent.

The critical question is whether transformation gains can outpace the erosion that Medicaid cuts will impose. Arkansas receives roughly $1 billion in RHTP funding over five years. The state faces an estimated $155 billion reduction in federal Medicaid spending over ten years. The arithmetic does not favor Arkansas, but arithmetic alone does not determine outcomes.

## What Works

### THRIVE Technology Infrastructure

**Assessment: Strong Survival Probability**

Arkansas's $266.75 million technology investment builds on existing infrastructure rather than starting from scratch. **UAMS e-Link** is one of the nation's largest telehealth networks with 25+ years of operational experience and connections to 400+ healthcare and education sites statewide. The **Institute for Digital Health and Innovation** provides training, technical support, and program development capacity that other states must create from nothing.

THRIVE succeeds because it extends proven capabilities rather than experimenting with unproven concepts. Remote patient monitoring works. Telehealth consultations work. EMS equipment modernization works. The challenge is deployment and adoption, not proof of concept.

The **$91.75 million remote monitoring** investment addresses Arkansas's chronic disease burden through technology-enabled management. Patients with diabetes, hypertension, and heart failure can be monitored continuously rather than seen episodically. Early intervention prevents hospitalizations. Efficiency gains extend limited clinical staff across larger patient populations.

The **$105 million EMS and equipment investment** fills infrastructure gaps that limit rural hospital capabilities. Aging ambulances, outdated diagnostic equipment, and inadequate communication systems compromise care quality and limit revenue-generating service offerings. Modern equipment enables services that justify facility operation.

The **$60 million telehealth expansion** extends specialty access to communities that cannot support resident specialists. Telepsychiatry addresses behavioral health shortages. Telestroke enables rapid diagnosis and treatment initiation. Specialty consultations reduce unnecessary transfers.

**Why THRIVE Survives Cuts**: Technology infrastructure, once built, has low marginal operating costs. Telehealth platforms require maintenance but not proportional ongoing investment. Remote monitoring programs require staff but generate efficiency savings. Equipment, once purchased, does not disappear when funding ends. THRIVE creates durable assets that persist beyond the funding window.

**Risk Factor**: Technology deployment without workflow integration produces expensive underutilization. Arkansas must ensure that providers adopt new capabilities rather than maintaining legacy practices. UAMS's established training infrastructure reduces but does not eliminate this risk.

### RISE Workforce Pipelines

**Assessment: Moderate to Strong Survival Probability (with caveats)**

Arkansas cannot recruit its way out of workforce shortages. Rural practice conditions, compensation differentials, and quality-of-life factors ensure that external recruitment will never meet needs. RISE's emphasis on internal pipeline development reflects accurate assessment of the problem.

The **$70.25 million for residency expansion and scholarships** creates training capacity that produces physicians more likely to practice in Arkansas. Research consistently shows that physicians trained in a state are more likely to remain in that state. Physicians who complete rural rotations during training are more likely to enter rural practice.

UAMS operates the state's only medical school and extensive regional campus networks that provide training sites outside Little Rock. Arkansas Colleges of Health Education adds osteopathic medical education. Nursing and allied health programs at Arkansas State and other institutions expand non-physician training capacity.

The **$67 million for recruitment and retention** incentives addresses the reality that training alone is insufficient. Sign-on bonuses, loan repayment, housing assistance, and retention bonuses reduce economic barriers to rural practice. These programs are common nationally, with mixed success rates. Arkansas's version may succeed or fail based on implementation quality.

The **$16.3 million for career advancement** supports incumbent worker development, enabling career progression without departure from rural communities. LPNs can become RNs. RNs can advance to nurse practitioners. Medical assistants can pursue nursing degrees. These programs retain workers who would otherwise leave for urban educational opportunities.

**Why RISE Partially Survives Cuts**: Residency slots, once created, become permanent GME capacity funded through Medicare. Graduates enter the workforce regardless of RHTP continuation. Pipeline programs produce workforce additions that persist beyond funding. However, incentive programs that require ongoing funding are vulnerable to elimination when RHTP ends.

**Risk Factor**: Retention is harder than recruitment. Arkansas can train physicians who then leave for urban practice elsewhere. Loan repayment programs work when recipients fulfill commitments; they fail when recipients pay back funds to practice elsewhere. RISE success depends on retention rates that historical data does not guarantee.

### CIN Formation Under PACT

**Assessment: Variable by Region**

PACT's **$110 million for Clinically Integrated Networks** represents high-variance investment. CINs can transform regional care delivery when they work. They consume resources without producing value when they fail. Arkansas's outcomes will vary by region based on pre-existing relationships, leadership quality, and local healthcare market conditions.

CINs work when participating providers see shared benefit from collaboration. A rural hospital that gains access to specialty referral networks, shared equipment, and coordinated discharge planning has reason to participate. A primary care clinic that receives specialist support, care coordination resources, and quality improvement assistance has reason to engage.

CINs fail when providers perceive threat rather than opportunity. A hospital that fears losing patients to regional competitors may resist data sharing. A physician practice that values autonomy may reject standardized protocols. An administrator who protects institutional prerogatives may undermine regional governance.

**Arkansas Rural Health Partnership (ARHP)** provides a foundation for CIN development in some regions. The organization includes 19 rural hospital members, 4 FQHCs, and 120+ affiliated clinics with established relationships and collaboration history. Regions where ARHP has strong presence may achieve CIN formation more readily than regions without similar infrastructure.

**Why Some CINs Survive Cuts**: Functional CINs generate value that justifies continued operation beyond RHTP funding. Shared services reduce costs. Coordinated care improves quality. Regional contracts create revenue streams. CINs that achieve these outcomes become self-sustaining. CINs that do not achieve these outcomes by 2030 will dissolve when funding ends.

**Risk Factor**: Arkansas is attempting to accelerate CIN formation with significant funding. Other states' experience suggests that CIN development requires years of relationship building that money cannot replace. Some regions will succeed because pre-existing relationships enable rapid progress. Other regions will fail because no amount of funding creates trust among historical competitors.

## What Struggles

### HEART Prevention Programs

**Assessment: Weak Survival Probability**

HEART's **$150.5 million for prevention, nutrition, and chronic disease management** addresses real needs through approaches with limited evidence for population-level impact. School-based clinics, community nutrition programs, and physical activity initiatives are worthy investments. Whether they produce measurable health outcomes within five years is questionable.

Chronic disease develops over decades. Lifestyle modifications that reduce disease risk require sustained behavior change over years. The relationship between prevention investment and health improvement is real but operates on timelines longer than RHTP's five-year funding window.

HEART's community-based delivery model, flowing through schools, faith organizations, and community centers, reduces administrative overhead but complicates accountability. When programs operate through dozens of decentralized partners, quality assurance and outcome measurement become difficult. Some partners will implement programs effectively. Others will not. Distinguishing success from failure requires evaluation infrastructure that HEART does not clearly fund.

**Arkansas's SNAP restrictions** (banning soft drinks and candy purchases) and school nutrition policies (SB59 requiring free breakfast) demonstrate state commitment to prevention priorities. These policies operate independently of RHTP and may produce benefits regardless of HEART program success. But policies that restrict choice differ from programs that change behavior.

**Why HEART Struggles Under Cuts**: Prevention programs require sustained investment to maintain activities. School-based clinics need ongoing staffing. Community programs need continuing coordination. Physical activity initiatives need persistent support. When RHTP funding ends, HEART programs that have not transitioned to alternative funding sources will cease. Unlike technology infrastructure or workforce additions, prevention programs do not create persistent assets.

**Risk Factor**: HEART may produce meaningful health improvements that are unmeasurable within the funding window. Prevention advocates will claim success based on activities delivered rather than outcomes achieved. Skeptics will claim failure based on unchanged population health statistics. Neither claim will be definitively provable.

### Practice Authority Expansion

**Assessment: Unlikely to Achieve Scope of Practice Reform**

PACT's **$25 million for expanding practice authority** signals Arkansas's recognition that scope of practice restrictions limit workforce deployment. Nurse practitioners and physician assistants who cannot practice independently in Arkansas can practice independently in other states. Restrictive scope laws constrain supply while competing states attract providers with more permissive regulations.

However, $25 million in RHTP funding does not translate to legislative success against organized physician opposition. The Arkansas Medical Society and specialty physician groups have historically opposed scope of practice expansion. Political influence in the legislature depends on relationships, campaign contributions, and constituent pressure, not federal grant dollars.

Arkansas may use RHTP funding to support pilot programs demonstrating safe independent practice, research documenting outcomes, and administrative changes within current legal authority. These activities are valuable but unlikely to achieve the comprehensive scope of practice reform that would meaningfully expand workforce capacity.

**Governor Sanders's administration** has emphasized healthcare workforce priorities, but the governor has not made scope of practice expansion a signature initiative. Significant legislative change requires gubernatorial prioritization that has not been evident.

**Why Practice Authority Expansion Struggles**: The $25 million allocation represents 2.5% of the total budget, insufficient to overcome entrenched political opposition. States that have achieved scope of practice reform have done so through sustained multi-year advocacy campaigns, not through one-time federal grants. Arkansas is more likely to achieve incremental administrative changes than comprehensive legislative reform.

**Risk Factor**: RHTP spending on scope of practice activities may be classified as lobbying or advocacy if not carefully structured. Federal grant rules restrict use of funds for lobbying. Arkansas must navigate complex compliance requirements while attempting to influence policy.

### Hospital Acquisitions and Partnerships

**Assessment: High Variance, High Stakes**

PACT's **$125 million for hospital acquisitions, partnerships, and facility upgrades** attempts to address the structural fragility of Arkansas's rural hospital system. The premise is that some hospitals are too weak to survive independently but could survive through affiliation with stronger systems.

Hospital transactions are complex, time-consuming, and frequently fail. Due diligence, regulatory approval, community engagement, and integration planning require 18-24 months for typical transactions. Arkansas is attempting to facilitate multiple transactions within a five-year window while managing all other RHTP implementation demands.

**Strategic consolidation** may stabilize some vulnerable hospitals. A small rural hospital with negative operating margins might achieve viability through affiliation with Baptist Health, CHI St. Vincent, or another regional system. The acquiring system provides management expertise, capital resources, and revenue cycle optimization. The acquired hospital preserves local access while gaining sustainability.

However, consolidation also creates risk. Acquiring systems may cut services that community needs but that drain financial resources. Regional health systems may prioritize profitable service lines over comprehensive community services. Promises made during acquisition may not survive post-transaction financial pressure.

**Facility upgrades** are more straightforward than transactions but still require effective project management. Construction delays, cost overruns, and specification problems can derail capital projects. Arkansas's DFA-led governance must provide or procure project management capacity that state agencies do not typically maintain.

**Why Hospital Transactions Have Variable Outcomes**: Some transactions will succeed, stabilizing previously vulnerable facilities. Other transactions will fail during negotiations or produce disappointing results post-closing. The $125 million is insufficient to rescue all 30 at-risk hospitals. Arkansas must triage, supporting hospitals with viable paths while allowing others to fail. This triage produces winners and losers among communities with equal claims to healthcare access.

## What Gets Cut When Funding Constrains

RHTP's five-year funding window creates inevitable triage decisions. Arkansas cannot implement all proposed activities at full scale within available resources. When constraints force prioritization, some initiatives will be reduced or eliminated.

### Priority Tier 1: Unlikely to Be Cut

- **THRIVE technology infrastructure**: Creates durable assets with low ongoing costs
- **RISE residency expansion**: Produces permanent GME capacity with Medicare funding
- **PACT CIN development** (core regions): Generates self-sustaining value once operational
- **Administrative functions**: Required for program operation

### Priority Tier 2: Reduced But Not Eliminated

- **RISE retention incentives**: Scaled to match available funding
- **PACT specialty integration**: Prioritized in regions with CIN success
- **THRIVE remote monitoring**: Deployed in highest-need populations first
- **HEART school-based clinics**: Concentrated in Delta and other priority areas

### Priority Tier 3: Vulnerable to Elimination

- **HEART community nutrition programs**: Limited evidence of impact within funding window
- **HEART physical activity initiatives**: Depend on partner capacity that varies by community
- **PACT practice authority expansion**: Unlikely to achieve legislative reform
- **RISE leadership training**: Important but not essential to core transformation

### Priority Tier 4: First to Be Cut

- **HEART programs in non-priority regions**: Limited funding spreads thin
- **PACT CIN development in regions without foundation**: Cannot force trust formation
- **Administrative overhead beyond minimum**: Efficiency pressure

## Social Care Integration Assessment

Arkansas's RHTP application does not prioritize dedicated social care infrastructure. Social determinants of health screening, community health worker deployment, and community information exchange platforms are embedded within broader initiatives rather than funded as standalone programs.

### Social Care Survival Table

| Component | Funding Status | Implementation Path | Survival Assessment |
|-----------|----------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| SDOH Screening | Not specified | CIN-level implementation | At Risk: No mandate, no funding |
| CHW Workforce | Not specified | ARHP, general workforce | At Risk: No protected allocation |
| CIE Platform | Not included | No identified vendor | Unlikely: Not in plan |
| Food Security | Within HEART | Community programs | At Risk: Prevention tier vulnerability |
| Transportation | Not specified | No identified strategy | Unlikely: Not addressed |
| Housing | Not specified | No identified strategy | Unlikely: Not addressed |

**Arkansas Community Health Worker Association (ARCHWA)** provides CHW infrastructure that predates RHTP. Annual summits since 2013, professional development programming, and advocacy for CHW recognition create workforce capacity. However, RHTP does not provide dedicated funding to expand or sustain CHW deployment. CHW programs may continue through other funding sources but are not protected within RHTP.

**Social Care Assessment**: Arkansas prioritizes clinical transformation over social care infrastructure. This choice reflects judgments about return on investment and implementation capacity. Social care integration may develop organically within CINs and community programs. Alternatively, Arkansas may complete RHTP implementation with minimal social care capability, requiring subsequent investment to address social determinants.

## The Expansion Paradox Revisited

Arkansas's fundamental strategic situation requires confronting the expansion paradox identified in Part 1. **Medicaid expansion through ARHOME prevented the hospital collapse that devastated neighboring non-expansion states.** One closure in Arkansas since 2014, versus 59 closures in the six surrounding non-expansion states. The policy worked.

Now that policy faces systematic erosion:

**Work requirements** take effect January 1, 2027 under federal mandate. Arkansas may implement earlier under its "Pathway to Prosperity" waiver proposal. Arkansas's 2018 experience with work requirements produced 18,000 coverage losses in nine months with no employment increase. Federal estimates project similar outcomes nationally. Arkansas may lose **70,000-114,000 ARHOME enrollees** to work requirement implementation, reducing hospital revenue and eliminating the coverage that kept rural residents connected to care.

**Enhanced federal matching** rates face reduction. The 90% federal match for expansion population generates significant state savings. Proposals to reduce this match would increase state costs or force coverage reductions.

**Provider tax limitations** and state-directed payment restrictions reduce state flexibility to enhance Medicaid rates. Arkansas uses these mechanisms to support rural hospital finances. Restrictions will reduce available revenue.

**More frequent redeterminations** increase administrative burden and coverage churn. Some percentage of eligible individuals will lose coverage during redetermination processes, then re-enroll, then lose coverage again. This churn disrupts care continuity and increases administrative costs for providers.

### The Arithmetic Problem

KFF estimates **$155 billion in federal Medicaid spending reduction** affecting rural Arkansas over ten years. RHTP provides approximately **$1 billion over five years**. The ratio is approximately 155:1 against Arkansas.

This arithmetic does not mean RHTP fails. RHTP invests in transformation that may produce efficiency gains, revenue diversification, and sustainable models that reduce Medicaid dependence. But RHTP cannot replace Medicaid revenue. The programs serve different purposes.

**Hospitals that depend on Medicaid expansion revenue** face existential pressure regardless of RHTP investment. THRIVE technology cannot substitute for patient revenue. RISE workforce cannot staff facilities without operating funds. PACT coordination cannot sustain hospitals without financial viability.

**The 11 hospitals at immediate closure risk** will face closure decisions before RHTP's five-year investment window closes. Some will close. Others will consolidate. A few may achieve standalone viability through transformation. The number of Arkansas rural hospitals in 2030 will be smaller than the number today. RHTP cannot prevent this contraction. RHTP can influence which hospitals survive and what services remain.

## Implementation Risk Assessment

### Governance Concentration

Arkansas concentrates RHTP authority in the governor's office and Department of Finance and Administration rather than distributing implementation across health-specific agencies. This structure has advantages and disadvantages.

**Advantages**: Clear accountability, direct gubernatorial control, coordinated decision-making, reduced interagency conflict.

**Disadvantages**: Limited health-specific expertise at DFA, political vulnerability if administration changes, concentrated failure risk, potential overload of administrative capacity.

The **$500,000 annual salary for project director Andy Babbitt** reflects the administration's seriousness about implementation. Whether DFA can execute health transformation at scale is unproven. The agency manages state finances, not healthcare delivery. Contracted expertise can fill gaps, but contractors are not substitutes for institutional capacity.

### Political Vulnerability

Governor Sanders's term extends through January 2027. RHTP implementation extends through 2030 or 2031. Administrative changes could alter priorities, governance structures, and implementation approaches. Programs that lack statutory protection depend on continued executive commitment.

Arkansas's RHTP is not embedded in legislation. The governor's office applied for funding, manages implementation, and controls priorities. A future governor could redirect resources, replace leadership, or deprioritize rural health transformation.

### Partner Dependency

RHTP implementation depends on partners who are not under state control:

- **UAMS** operates academic programs, telehealth networks, and regional campuses essential to multiple initiatives
- **Arkansas Rural Health Partnership** coordinates among 19 rural hospitals and 120+ clinics
- **Regional health systems** (Baptist, CHI St. Vincent, Mercy) operate facilities and provide integration capacity
- **Community organizations** deliver HEART programs and PACT coordination

Partners may prioritize their own institutional interests over RHTP objectives. Hospitals may resist CIN participation. Health systems may cherry-pick advantageous transactions. Community organizations may lack capacity for program delivery. The state cannot compel partner performance.

### Federal Compliance

RHTP requires states to obligate funds within two years of receipt and comply with evolving CMS guidance. Federal rules may change during the implementation period. Audit findings could require fund returns. Compliance burden consumes administrative capacity that might otherwise support implementation.

Arkansas's DFA has experience managing federal grants but not at this scale or in this policy domain. Learning curves for compliance requirements may slow implementation or produce findings that complicate program continuation.

## Strategic Assessment

### Strengths

**Existing infrastructure**: UAMS telehealth network, ARHP hospital network, established CHW association, functioning ARHOME program provide foundations for RHTP expansion.

**Medicaid expansion base**: Despite erosion pressure, Arkansas maintains coverage infrastructure that non-expansion states lack. ARHOME enrollees remain connected to care while enrolled.

**Governor prioritization**: Direct gubernatorial involvement and concentrated authority enable rapid decision-making and consistent priorities.

**Prevention policy alignment**: SNAP restrictions, school nutrition requirements, and Natural State Initiative demonstrate sustained commitment to prevention independent of RHTP.

### Vulnerabilities

**Highest vulnerability rate**: 50% of rural hospitals vulnerable to closure creates enormous challenge. RHTP cannot rescue all at-risk facilities.

**Work requirement history**: Arkansas's 2018 experience predicts significant coverage losses from 2027 implementation. Lessons learned may mitigate but not eliminate harm.

**Administrative inexperience**: DFA lacks health transformation expertise. Implementation quality depends on contracted capacity and partner execution.

**Social care gaps**: Limited attention to social determinants, CHW deployment, and community information exchange may leave transformation incomplete.

### Probability Assessment

| Outcome | Probability | Description |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Full Success | 5-10% | All initiatives achieve objectives, transformation outpaces erosion |
| Substantial Success | 20-30% | Most initiatives achieve partial objectives, net positive trajectory |
| Partial Success | 35-45% | Some initiatives succeed, others fail, mixed outcomes |
| Substantial Failure | 15-20% | Most initiatives underperform, erosion dominates transformation |
| Full Failure | 5-10% | Implementation collapse, funds wasted, worse than baseline |

**Most likely outcome**: Partial success with significant variation across initiatives and regions. THRIVE technology infrastructure succeeds. RISE workforce pipelines produce graduates who may or may not remain in Arkansas. PACT CINs succeed in some regions and fail in others. HEART prevention programs produce activities but questionable health outcomes. Hospital closures continue despite transformation efforts.

## What Arkansas Must Accept

Transformation cannot save every hospital. Arkansas will have fewer rural hospitals in 2030 than in 2025. The question is not whether contraction occurs but how it occurs, which hospitals survive, and what services remain.

Transformation cannot replace Medicaid revenue. RHTP creates capacity and efficiency. It does not substitute for operating funds that Medicaid cuts will eliminate. Hospitals that depend on expansion revenue face closure regardless of RHTP investment.

Transformation cannot occur faster than relationships develop. CIN formation requires trust that funding cannot purchase. Regions without pre-existing collaboration infrastructure may not achieve functional networks within five years.

Transformation may not produce measurable health outcomes within the funding window. Prevention investments require decades to alter chronic disease trajectories. Workforce investments require years before trained providers enter practice. Technology investments require adoption periods before utilization achieves potential.

## Conclusion

Arkansas's RHTP strategy is comprehensive, well-structured, and responsive to the state's specific challenges. The plan's emphasis on technology infrastructure (THRIVE), workforce development (RISE), and care delivery integration (PACT) addresses real needs through approaches that can succeed.

Whether the plan succeeds depends on factors beyond Arkansas's control. Federal Medicaid policy will determine whether the coverage foundation that prevented hospital collapse remains viable. Work requirement implementation will determine how many Arkansans lose coverage that connects them to care. CMS guidance will determine flexibility for implementation adaptation.

The expansion paradox resolves in one of two ways. Either Arkansas's transformation investments create systems resilient enough to survive Medicaid erosion, demonstrating that intervention can work even when policy protection weakens. Or erosion overwhelms transformation, demonstrating that system-level policy protection cannot be replaced by facility-level investment.

Arkansas is betting on the first outcome. The bet is not irrational. The bet may not succeed.

The $1 billion investment matters. How Arkansas deploys these resources shapes rural health trajectories for communities that have no alternative providers, no alternative coverage, and no alternative to the transformation that RHTP enables or the erosion that Medicaid cuts impose.

What happens in Arkansas will inform rural health policy for a generation.
