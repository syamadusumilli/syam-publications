*Rural Health Transformation Project*
*Version 6: January 2026*

## Purpose

This document provides **detailed state-by-state analysis** of social care integration infrastructure under the Rural Health Transformation Program. Each state profile examines SDOH/HRSN status, CIE platform deployment, CHW program structure, and key gaps or strengths.

**Related Documents:**
- **3-TD-E:** Core inventory tables and status summaries
- **GGH_CIE_Market_Assessment:** Vendor competition and market opportunity analysis

## South Central/Western Priority Region (Batch 9)

### Regional Overview

The South Central/Western Priority states (TX, OK, CA) present **dramatically different social care infrastructure paradigms** reflecting expansion status, state capacity, and philosophical orientation toward health transformation. Texas demonstrates **mature CHW certification without sustainable Medicaid financing** combined with **fragmented regional CIE deployments** despite having the nation's largest rural population. Oklahoma presents an emerging opportunity with **2024 SPA approval creating CHW reimbursement** against minimal CIE infrastructure. California operates in a **fundamentally different paradigm** where CalAIM's comprehensive 1115 waiver supersedes traditional CIE models while CHW workforce development remains constrained by paused certification and inadequate reimbursement rates.

**Key Regional Patterns:**

1. **Non-expansion states fragment social care:** Texas and Oklahoma demonstrate MCO-driven approaches without state coordination infrastructure
2. **Scale creates market opportunity:** Texas's massive rural population (4.96M) creates platform opportunity despite fragmentation; no vendor has achieved statewide coordination
3. **CHW certification does not guarantee financing:** Texas has 20+ year certification history but limited Medicaid reimbursement
4. **SPA development accelerating:** Oklahoma's 2024 SPA approval demonstrates national trend toward CHW Medicaid coverage
5. **CalAIM creates distinct market dynamics:** California's comprehensive transformation closes platform market; entry requires MCP partnership
6. **Tribal health creates parallel system:** Oklahoma's 39 federally recognized tribes operate CHR programs independently

### Texas: Highest South Central/Western CIE Opportunity

**Research Date:** January 29, 2026
**Overall Status:** **PARTIAL (CHW certified but underfinanced, CIE fragmented)**
**Confidence:** High

**RHTP Context**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Year 1 Award** | $515,900,000 |
| **Rural Population** | ~4.96 million |
| **Per Capita** | ~$104/rural resident |
| **Lead Agency** | Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) |
| **Medicaid Status** | **Non-expansion** |
| **Coverage Gap** | 761,000+ residents |
| **Hospital Risk** | 77 hospitals at elevated risk |

Texas holds the **largest rural population of any state** and the **largest population in the coverage gap**, creating extreme SDOH burden that RHTP cannot address without expansion. The scale penalty in per-capita funding ($104) compared to smaller states reflects formula structures rewarding geographic sparsity over population size.

**CIE Platform Status: FRAGMENTED REGIONAL**

| Factor | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Statewide Platform** | **None** |
| **Findhelp Presence** | **Yes (11 hospital systems, 8 health centers, Superior Health Plan MCO)** |
| **Unite Us Presence** | **Yes (UMC Lubbock/South Plains Food Bank partnership)** |
| **Closed-Loop Referrals** | Regional only; no statewide interoperability |
| **RHTP Investment** | Not explicitly included |

**What Exists:**

**Findhelp Deployments:**
- 11 hospital systems using platform for social needs screening and referral
- 8 federally qualified health centers with active deployments
- Superior Health Plan (Medicaid MCO) enterprise contract
- **ConnectATX Navigator Model:** United Way Greater Austin partnership combines Findhelp platform with trained navigators
- Statewide hospital system uptake but fragmented implementation

**Unite Us Deployments:**
- UMC Lubbock partnership with South Plains Food Bank for regional coordination
- Limited presence compared to Findhelp in major metro areas
- No statewide network identified

**Central Texas Model Community:**
- Austin-area integration combining Findhelp + Texas 211 + Connxus HIE + Dell Medical SHIP platform
- Multi-platform coordination pilot without statewide replication

**211 Texas:**
- United Way-operated statewide resource directory
- Information and referral capability
- **No closed-loop functionality**

**CHCS May 2025 Report Findings:**
- Documented fragmented landscape requiring interoperability standards
- Multiple platforms serving same geographies without data exchange
- MCO-specific tools creating additional fragmentation

**CHW Program Status: MATURE CERTIFICATION / LIMITED MEDICAID**

| Factor | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **State Certification** | **Yes (Mandatory since 2001)** |
| **Certifying Body** | Texas DSHS CHW Training & Certification Program |
| **Training Requirements** | 160-hour training OR 1,000 hours experience (past 3 years) |
| **Training Programs** | **49 certified programs** (community colleges, AHECs, FQHCs, CBOs) |
| **Medicaid Reimbursement** | **Limited** |

**Certification Framework:**

Texas Health and Safety Code Chapter 48 (effective 2001) establishes **mandatory certification** for compensated CHWs:
- No person may hold themselves out as a CHW or promotora for compensation without DSHS certification
- Among the earliest and most comprehensive state certification requirements nationally
- **49 approved training programs** distributed across the state
- Workforce estimated at 89% female with strong promotora tradition

**Medicaid Reimbursement Limitations:**

Texas lacks comprehensive SPA for CHW services. Limited coverage exists through targeted legislation:

**HB 113 (2023):**
- Allows Medicaid MCOs to categorize CHW expenditures as quality improvement costs
- Does **not** establish direct service reimbursement
- Value-added benefit rather than covered service

**HB 1575 (2023):**
- Establishes CHW as separate provider type in Medicaid
- Limited to **Case Management for Children & Pregnant Women Program only**
- Does not extend to general population

**No Comprehensive SPA:**
- Texas has not submitted comprehensive State Plan Amendment for general CHW services coverage
- MCO contracts may include CHW services as value-added benefits at plan discretion
- No fee-for-service pathway for most CHW services

**Significance:** Texas demonstrates a paradox where **mature workforce infrastructure** coexists with **limited financing sustainability**. The 49 training programs produce certified CHWs without clear Medicaid pathway for most services.

**SDOH/HRSN Status: FRAGMENTED / AT RISK**

| Factor | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Screening** | MCO-specific, not mandated statewide |
| **Navigation** | MCO-driven through individual plan contracts |
| **Integration Model** | MCO-fragmented without state coordination |
| **1115 Waiver** | Yes (Texas Healthcare Transformation) through 2030, **no HRSN services** |

**Key Limitation:** CMS rescinded HRSN guidance in March 2025. Texas did not apply for HRSN services waiver under Biden-era framework. Current 1115 waiver focuses on managed care authority and maintaining uncompensated care pool rather than SDOH integration.

**Survival Assessment:** Social care components face **high vulnerability** given non-expansion status, lack of 1115 HRSN authority, and RHTP application emphasis on clinical infrastructure.

**TD-E Classification:** **Partial** (CHW certified but underfinanced, CIE fragmented)

**GGH Strategic Assessment:**
- **CIE Gap:** **MODERATE-HIGH** (fragmented regional without statewide coordination)
- **Market Priority:** **MODERATE-HIGH**
- **Entry Points:** Texas Hospital Association, Texas Association of Community Health Centers, Texas DSHS CHW Program Office, Superior Health Plan, East Texas regional health systems
- **Target Geography:** East Texas Region (Smith, Gregg, Harrison, Cherokee, Nacogdoches, Angelina, Rusk counties)
- **Offering:** Platform + Services (Regional CIE deployment with CHW integration leveraging existing certified workforce, advocacy for comprehensive SPA)

### Oklahoma: Emerging CHW Opportunity with Minimal CIE

**Research Date:** January 29, 2026
**Overall Status:** **EMERGING (CHW financed, CIE minimal)**
**Confidence:** Medium-High

**RHTP Context**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Year 1 Award** | $195,400,000 |
| **Rural Population** | ~525,000 |
| **Per Capita** | ~$372/rural resident |
| **Lead Agency** | Oklahoma State Department of Health (OSDH) |
| **Medicaid Status** | **Non-expansion** |
| **Coverage Gap** | ~90,000 residents |
| **Tribal Health** | 39 federally recognized tribes with distinct health systems |

Oklahoma demonstrates **higher per-capita RHTP allocation** than Texas due to smaller rural population, but faces implementation challenges from recent Medicaid managed care transition and significant tribal health complexity.

**CIE Platform Status: LIMITED PRESENCE**

| Factor | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Statewide Platform** | **None identified** |
| **Findhelp Presence** | No statewide deployment documented |
| **Unite Us Presence** | "Unite Oklahoma" network exists; scale unclear |
| **Closed-Loop Referrals** | Limited or none |
| **RHTP Investment** | Unknown |

**What Exists:**

**Unite Oklahoma Network:**
- Network page exists (uniteus.com/networks/oklahoma/)
- Specific coverage area, participating organizations, and utilization metrics not publicly documented
- Appears limited compared to mature Unite Us deployments in other states

**211 Oklahoma:**
- Standard 211 resource and referral service
- No closed-loop referral capability

**Tribal Health Systems:**
- Indian Health Service and tribal health programs operate independently
- Community Health Representatives (CHRs) provide similar services to CHWs through tribal systems
- Not integrated with state CIE infrastructure

**CHW Program Status: EMERGING / SPA APPROVED**

| Factor | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **State Certification** | **No (Uses C3 Core Competencies as framework)** |
| **Certifying Body** | None; C3 training accepted |
| **Training Providers** | OK State Dept of Health, Tulsa City-County Health, OKC-County Health, OSU |
| **Medicaid Reimbursement** | **Yes (SPA Approved 2024)** |
| **Dedicated State Office** | **Yes (NASHP 2024-2025 tracker confirms)** |

**SPA Approval Details:**

NASHP confirms Oklahoma among **four states receiving CMS SPA approval in 2024** (alongside Colorado, Georgia, Washington):
- Reimbursement pathway established for CHW services through Medicaid
- Requirements: C3 training certificate OR 2,000 hours documented experience
- Service setting: Must work at public health clinic; services ordered by physician/licensed practitioner
- No statewide certification requirement

**MCO Activity:**
- Oklahoma Complete Health offers CHW home visits for pediatric asthma management
- Implemented as value-added service through managed care contract
- Demonstrates MCO interest in CHW services

**Tribal Health Workers:**
- Community Health Representatives (CHRs) operate through tribal programs
- Distinct from state CHW certification/reimbursement framework
- Long history of community-based care within tribal systems
- Not integrated with state Medicaid SPA framework

**Significance:** Oklahoma's 2024 SPA approval **without certification requirement** creates lower barrier to CHW service delivery while establishing Medicaid financing pathway.

**SDOH/HRSN Status: LIMITED / AT RISK**

| Factor | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Screening** | Not mandated statewide |
| **Navigation** | Limited; managed care transition ongoing |
| **Integration Model** | Emerging through managed care contracts |
| **1115 Waiver** | Limited (managed care transition focus), **no HRSN services** |

**Survival Assessment:** SDOH components face **moderate-high vulnerability** given non-expansion status, lack of 1115 HRSN authority, and ongoing managed care transition creating competing priorities. CHW services have established financing pathway through SPA.

**TD-E Classification:** **Emerging** (CHW financed, CIE minimal)

**GGH Strategic Assessment:**
- **CIE Gap:** **MODERATE** (near-greenfield with Unite Oklahoma limited presence)
- **Market Priority:** **MODERATE**
- **Entry Points:** Oklahoma State Department of Health, Oklahoma Hospital Association, Oklahoma Primary Care Association, Oklahoma Complete Health (MCO with CHW interest), tribal health programs (distinct approach required)
- **Target Geography:** Rural Eastern Oklahoma (Cherokee, Creek, Adair, Muskogee counties)
- **Offering:** Platform + Services (CIE deployment combined with CHW services leveraging new SPA; tribal partnerships as separate track)
- **Challenges:** Tribal CHR programs operate independently; managed care transition creates implementation competing priorities

### California: CalAIM Saturation Closes Platform Market

**Research Date:** January 29, 2026
**Overall Status:** **FUNDED (CalAIM comprehensive, but certification paused, rural gaps)**
**Confidence:** High

**RHTP Context**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Year 1 Award** | $625,500,000 |
| **Rural Population** | ~4.63 million |
| **Per Capita** | ~$135/rural resident |
| **Lead Agency** | California Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) |
| **Medicaid Status** | **Expansion** |
| **CalAIM Status** | Active 1115 demonstration through 2026 |
| **Unique Complexity** | CalAIM supersedes traditional CIE model |

California operates in a **fundamentally different paradigm** from Texas and Oklahoma. CalAIM (California Advancing and Innovating Medi-Cal) represents the nation's most comprehensive Medicaid transformation, creating **MCP-integrated social care delivery** that supersedes traditional CIE platform approaches.

**CIE Platform Status: CALAIM SUPERSEDES**

| Factor | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Statewide Platform** | **N/A (CalAIM/MCP-integrated)** |
| **Findhelp Presence** | Regional only; superseded by CalAIM |
| **Unite Us Presence** | Regional only; superseded by CalAIM |
| **Integration Model** | **MCP-mandatory** |
| **RHTP Investment** | Supplements existing CalAIM infrastructure |

**CalAIM Framework:**

**Community Supports (14 Services):**
- Housing transition navigation services
- Housing deposits
- Housing tenancy and sustaining services
- Short-term post-hospitalization housing
- Recuperative care (medical respite)
- Respite services
- Day habilitation programs
- Nursing facility transition/diversion to assisted living
- Community transition services/nursing facility transition
- Personal care and homemaker services
- Environmental accessibility adaptations (home modifications)
- Medically supportive food/nutrition services
- Sobering centers
- Asthma remediation

**Enhanced Care Management (ECM):**
- Intensive care coordination for high-need populations
- Populations of focus: experiencing homelessness, high utilizers, serious mental illness, pregnant/postpartum
- Lead Care Manager model with comprehensive assessment
- MCP-contracted providers deliver services

**Data Exchange Framework (DxF):**
- State-mandated interoperability framework (effective January 2024)
- Requires health and social service data exchange across organizations
- Creates state-level coordination infrastructure

**Implementation Reality:**

**CHCF 2024 Survey Findings:**
- Lower utilization than expected across ECM and Community Supports
- ECM enrollment: 0.9% of eligible population
- Community Supports enrollment: 0.9% of eligible population
- MCP variation in eligibility criteria and implementation
- Administrative burden cited as significant barrier

**Rural Implementation Gaps:**
- Lower uptake in rural areas than urban
- CBO capacity constraints limit Community Supports delivery
- **PATH Funding ($1.84 billion)** targets rural and historically under-resourced areas
- Standardization efforts underway (DHCS 2024-2025 action plan)

**Significance:** California's CIE market is **effectively closed for platform competition**. MCPs serve as the integration mechanism; standalone CIE vendors must work through or alongside MCP infrastructure.

**CHW Program Status: BENEFIT LIVE / CERTIFICATION PAUSED**

| Factor | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **State Certification** | **Paused Indefinitely (November 2023)** |
| **Certifying Body** | HCAI (development paused) |
| **Medi-Cal Benefit** | **Yes (Effective July 2022)** |
| **Billing Codes** | CPT 98960-98962, Medicare G-codes (CHI/PIN) |
| **Reimbursement Rate** | $27.54/30 min (2024) to $31.74/30 min (2025) |

**Medi-Cal CHW/P/R Benefit:**

The Community Health Worker/Promotora/Representative (CHW/P/R) benefit became effective July 2022:
- Reimbursable through CPT codes 98960-98962 and Medicare G-codes
- Rate increase in 2025: $31.74 per 30 minutes (100% of Medicare RVUs)
- Services must be under written recommendation from licensed provider
- Plan of care required for services exceeding 6 hours

**Supervising Provider Types:**
- Physicians, nurse practitioners, licensed clinical social workers
- Pharmacists, mental health practitioners
- **CBOs and Local Health Jurisdictions (LHJs) added January 2024**

**Certification Pause:**

November 2023: HCAI paused certification guidance following stakeholder concerns:
- Feedback that stakeholders had not been adequately engaged
- Concerns that proposed requirements not fit-for-purpose
- Guidance paused indefinitely pending additional engagement

**2024 Community Dialogues:**
- CalHHS, HCAI, and DHCS conducted second engagement round
- 680+ CHW/P/Rs participated across 23 sessions hosted by 20 organizations
- Re-examined workforce needs and certification approach
- Advisory Workgroup established December 2024 (majority active CHW/P/Rs)

**Sustainability Challenges:**

**Rate Insufficiency:**
- $31.74/30 min cited as insufficient for CBO sustainability
- Administrative burden exceeds reimbursement value for many providers
- CBOs struggle to maintain CHW programs on Medi-Cal reimbursement alone

**Budget Cuts:**
- 2024 Budget Act eliminated most HCAI CHW/P/R funding
- Limited state investment in workforce development
- Certification development constrained by funding limitations

**Significance:** California paradox where **benefit exists but sustainability mechanisms remain incomplete**. Certification pause and inadequate rates limit workforce growth despite policy framework supporting CHW services.

**SDOH/HRSN Status: FUNDED (CALAIM)**

| Factor | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Screening** | MCP-mandated through CalAIM |
| **Navigation** | ECM Lead Care Manager model |
| **Integration Model** | MCP-integrated with Community Supports benefit |
| **1115 Waiver** | Yes (CalAIM) through December 2026, **14 Community Supports services** |
| **Investment Level** | Billions through MCP contracts + IPP + PATH |

**Funding Mechanisms:**
- **Incentive Payment Program (IPP):** Performance payments to MCPs for ECM/Community Supports implementation
- **Provider Assistance for Transition to Health (PATH):** $1.84 billion for providers serving rural/under-resourced areas
- **MCP Contract Requirements:** MCPs required to offer ECM and Community Supports; investment built into rates

**Survival Assessment:** CalAIM represents **most sustainable SDOH model nationally** with waiver authority, MCP integration, and significant state investment. However, rural implementation gaps create service delivery opportunities distinct from platform opportunities.

**TD-E Classification:** **Funded** (CalAIM comprehensive, but certification paused, rural gaps)

**GGH Strategic Assessment:**
- **CIE Gap:** **LOW** (CalAIM/MCP saturation)
- **Market Priority:** **LOW**
- **Limited Opportunities:** Rural Community Supports service delivery where CBO capacity insufficient; CHW services in rural areas with low ECM/Community Supports uptake
- **Not Recommended:** Platform deployment (CalAIM/MCP infrastructure supersedes), statewide market entry (regulatory complexity), CHW workforce development (certification paused, funding eliminated)
- **If Pursued Entry Points:** California Primary Care Association (rural FQHC needs), Central Valley MCPs (documented implementation challenges), PATH-funded providers seeking implementation support
- **Target Geography:** If pursued, Central Valley or Northern California rural counties with lowest CalAIM uptake

### South Central/Western Region Summary

| State | CIE Platform | CHW Status | HRSN/SDOH | TD-E Status | GGH CIE Gap |
|-------|--------------|------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **TX** | Fragmented Regional (Findhelp/Unite Us) | Mandatory cert (DSHS, 49 programs), limited Medicaid | MCO-fragmented | **Partial** | **MODERATE-HIGH** |
| **OK** | Limited (Unite Oklahoma) | No cert, 2024 SPA approved | Emerging MCO | **Emerging** | **MODERATE** |
| **CA** | CalAIM/MCP-integrated | Paused cert, Medi-Cal benefit active | Funded (CalAIM) | **Funded** | **LOW** |

## Deep South Priority Region (Batch 7)

### Regional Overview

The Deep South Priority states (MS, TN, GA, NC) present **dramatically differentiated social care infrastructure maturity** spanning from North Carolina's nation-leading CIE deployment (NCCARE360 statewide) to Georgia's complete absence of social care strategy in its RHTP application. The region divides into two distinct categories: states with established CIE infrastructure (TN, NC) showing mature platform deployments with MCO integration, and states without CIE infrastructure (MS, GA) demonstrating that **non-expansion status correlates with social care deprioritization**.

**Key Regional Patterns:**

1. **Non-expansion states deprioritize social care:** Mississippi and Georgia RHTP applications emphasize clinical infrastructure over SDOH/CIE investment
2. **Binary CIE market structure:** Tennessee and North Carolina have mature statewide platforms; Mississippi and Georgia have none
3. **CHW legislation creates sustainability pathway:** Mississippi's HB 1401 (2025) creates mandatory certification and directs Medicaid SPA development
4. **Platform maturity determines entry strategy:** Mature platforms (TN, NC) require services approach; greenfield markets (MS, GA) require platform deployment
5. **Black Belt/Delta geography spans multiple states:** Creating cross-state regional approach opportunity

### Mississippi: Highest Deep South CIE Opportunity

**Research Date:** January 29, 2026
**Overall Status:** **PARTIAL (CHW emerging, no CIE)**
**Confidence:** High

**RHTP Context**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Year 1 Award** | $205,907,220 |
| **Rural Population** | ~2.1 million |

| **Medicaid Status** | **Non-expansion** |
| **Coverage Gap** | 100,000+ residents |
| **Hospital Risk** | 54% of rural hospitals vulnerable (highest nationally) |

**CIE Platform Status: NONE IDENTIFIED**

| Factor | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Statewide Platform** | None |
| **Unite Us Presence** | No network identified |
| **Findhelp Presence** | No statewide deployment |
| **Closed-Loop Referrals** | None integrated with clinical care |
| **RHTP Investment** | Not explicitly included |

**What Exists:**
- **Delta Health Alliance:** Regional coordination in Delta counties providing health education, care coordination, and community outreach without closed-loop technology
- **211 Services:** United Way-operated resource directory without closed-loop capability
- **CRIS Regional Networks (Proposed):** Mississippi's RHTP centerpiece creates regional coordination hubs, but initial focus is clinical infrastructure rather than social care referral systems

**CHW Program Status: EMERGING / LEGISLATED**

| Factor | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **State Certification** | **Yes (HB 1401, effective January 1, 2026)** |
| **Certifying Body** | Mississippi State Department of Health (MSDH) |
| **Medicaid Reimbursement** | **Pending** (HB 1401 directs SPA/waiver development) |
| **Training Programs** | Aaron E. Henry Community Health Center, USM, Jackson State, Itawamba CC |

**HB 1401 Requirements (2025):**
- MSDH shall implement and manage CHW certification program
- Division of Medicaid shall seek CMS approval for SPA, waiver, or alternative payment model
- After January 1, 2026, no person may represent themselves as a CHW without MSDH certification
- Reimbursable services include preventive services, chronic disease management, health promotion, screenings, referrals, and care coordination

**TD-E Classification:** **Partial** (CHW emerging, no CIE)

**GGH Strategic Assessment:**
- **CIE Gap:** **CRITICAL** (no existing platform infrastructure)
- **Market Priority:** **HIGH**
- **Entry Points:** Mississippi Hospital Association, Mississippi Primary Health Care Association, Delta Health Alliance, MSDH Office of Rural Health
- **Target Geography:** Delta Region (Bolivar, Coahoma, Humphreys, Issaquena, Leflore, Quitman, Sharkey, Sunflower, Tallahatchie, Tunica, Washington)

### Tennessee: Mature Platform Without CHW Sustainability

**Research Date:** January 29, 2026
**Overall Status:** **MODERATE**
**Confidence:** High

**RHTP Context**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Year 1 Award** | $333,790,000 |
| **Rural Population** | ~1.8 million |
| **Per Capita** | ~$185/rural resident |
| **Lead Agency** | Tennessee Department of Health |
| **Medicaid Status** | **Non-expansion** |
| **Coverage Gap** | ~139,000 residents |

**CIE Platform Status: STATEWIDE (TN COMMUNITY COMPASS)**

| Factor | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Statewide Platform** | **TN Community Compass (Findhelp)** |
| **Launch Date** | **2015** (predates RHTP by decade) |
| **MCO Integration** | **Yes** (TennCare MCO partnerships) |
| **Coverage** | Statewide |
| **RHTP Investment** | Not specified (existing infrastructure) |

**TN Community Compass History:**
- Among earliest statewide CIE deployments nationally
- MCO partnerships established through TennCare managed care contracts
- Platform maturity creates significant market barrier for new entrants

**CHW Program Status: VOLUNTARY / NO MEDICAID**

| Factor | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **State Certification** | **Voluntary** (TNCHWA accreditation model) |
| **Certifying Body** | Tennessee Community Health Worker Association (TNCHWA) |
| **Medicaid Reimbursement** | **None** |
| **Training Programs** | TNCHWA, Vanderbilt, community college programs |

**Significance:** Tennessee has **mature CIE but weak CHW financing**, creating opposite pattern from Mississippi.

**TD-E Classification:** **Moderate** (strong CIE, weak CHW)

**GGH Strategic Assessment:**
- **CIE Gap:** **LOW** (TN Community Compass captures market)
- **Market Priority:** **LOW**
- **Limited Opportunity:** CHW services development; platform market closed

### Georgia: Critical CIE Opportunity with Explicit Social Care Exclusion

**Research Date:** January 29, 2026
**Overall Status:** **CUT**
**Confidence:** High

**RHTP Context**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Year 1 Award** | $388,200,000 |
| **Rural Population** | ~1.8 million |
| **Per Capita** | ~$216/rural resident |
| **Lead Agency** | Georgia Department of Community Health (DCH) |
| **Medicaid Status** | **Partial expansion (Pathways to Coverage)** |
| **Coverage Gap** | **175,000+ residents** (largest in region relative to Pathways enrollment of ~6,500) |

**CIE Platform Status: NONE (EXPLICITLY EXCLUDED)**

| Factor | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Statewide Platform** | **None** |
| **RHTP Application** | **Social care explicitly absent** |
| **Unite Us Presence** | No Georgia network identified |
| **Findhelp Presence** | No statewide deployment |

**Significance:** Georgia's RHTP application **explicitly excludes** social care infrastructure investment, focusing on clinical transformation. This represents policy choice rather than oversight.

**Pathways to Coverage Failure:**
- Projected enrollment: 100,000+
- Actual enrollment: ~6,500 (as of latest data)
- Work requirements create barrier to coverage
- 175,000+ remain in coverage gap despite partial expansion

**CHW Program Status: PENDING / HB 291**

| Factor | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **State Certification** | **Pending** (HB 291 introduced) |
| **Medicaid Reimbursement** | **None** |

**TD-E Classification:** **Cut** (social care excluded from RHTP)

**GGH Strategic Assessment:**
- **CIE Gap:** **CRITICAL** (explicit policy gap)
- **Market Priority:** **HIGH**
- **Strategy:** Black Belt alignment with Alabama strategy; state policy change required for RHTP funding

### North Carolina: Nation-Leading CIE with Service Delivery Risk

**Research Date:** January 29, 2026
**Overall Status:** **AT RISK (HOP discontinuation)**
**Confidence:** High

**RHTP Context**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Year 1 Award** | $436,500,000 |
| **Rural Population** | ~2.5 million |
| **Per Capita** | ~$175/rural resident |
| **Lead Agency** | NC DHHS |
| **Medicaid Status** | **Expansion (December 2023)** |

**CIE Platform Status: STATEWIDE (NCCARE360)**

| Factor | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Statewide Platform** | **NCCARE360 (Unite Us)** |
| **Coverage** | **All 100 counties** |
| **MCO Integration** | **Yes** (NC Medicaid Prepaid Health Plans) |
| **Launch** | 2019 pilot, statewide expansion |

**NCCARE360 represents nation's most comprehensive statewide CIE deployment** with universal county coverage and deep MCO integration.

**CHW Program Status: MCO-INTEGRATED**

NC CHW programs operate through Prepaid Health Plan contracts with MCO-based reimbursement rather than direct SPA.

**Service Delivery Risk: HOP DISCONTINUATION**

**Healthy Opportunities Pilots (HOP)** provided service delivery funding for social care interventions. **HOP discontinuation threatens social care service delivery** despite platform maturity.

**TD-E Classification:** **At Risk** (platform mature, service delivery funding threatened)

**GGH Strategic Assessment:**
- **CIE Gap:** **LOW** (NCCARE360 saturation)
- **Market Priority:** **LOW**
- **Limited Opportunity:** Service delivery in gaps created by HOP discontinuation; platform market closed

### Deep South Region Summary

| State | CIE Platform | CHW Status | HRSN/SDOH | TD-E Status | GGH CIE Gap |

## Appalachian Priority Region (Batch 8)

### Regional Overview

The Appalachian Priority states (OH, KY, WV) share **robust CHW infrastructure without statewide CIE platforms** despite having three expansion states with active care coordination programs. The region demonstrates that **expansion status alone does not guarantee CIE development**. All three states show preference for regional hub models over centralized systems, creating federated platform opportunities.

**Key Regional Patterns:**

1. **Expansion states lack statewide CIE:** Ohio, Kentucky, and West Virginia all expanded Medicaid but have no statewide CIE coordination
2. **Robust CHW infrastructure without sustainable financing:** MCO-mediated reimbursement limited to maternal/SUD populations
3. **Regional hub preference:** Ohio Pathways HUBs, Kentucky Homeplace demonstrate regional rather than centralized approach
4. **Opioid crisis creates SUD-social care nexus:** Providing reimbursement pathway for CHW services addressing substance use
5. **Gap is platform infrastructure, not workforce or program design**

### Ohio: Pathways HUBs Without Interoperability

**Research Date:** January 29, 2026
**Overall Status:** **PARTIAL**
**Confidence:** High

**RHTP Context**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Year 1 Award** | $416,300,000 |
| **Rural Population** | ~2.4 million |
| **Per Capita** | ~$173/rural resident |

| **Coverage** | **70+ counties** (fragmented) |
| **Interoperability** | **None between hubs** |
| **Coordinating Body** | Partnership for Advancing Community Health (PACH) |

**Pathways HUB Model:**
- Nationally recognized evidence-based care coordination model
- 12 certified hubs operating across 70+ counties
- **No interoperability between hubs** creates data silos
- Each hub may use proprietary technology
- PACH coordinates certification standards but not technology

**CHW Program Status: ESTABLISHED / MCO-MATERNAL ONLY**

| Factor | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **State Certification** | **Yes (Ohio Board of Nursing since 2003)** |
| **Medicaid Reimbursement** | **MCO-based, maternal populations only** |
| **Training Programs** | CHW Excellence, Health Impact Ohio |

**Significance:** Ohio has **nation's most developed Pathways HUB network** but no platform connecting hubs creates federated system opportunity.

**TD-E Classification:** **Partial** (strong hubs, no statewide CIE)

**GGH Strategic Assessment:**
- **CIE Gap:** **MODERATE** (hub interoperability opportunity)
- **Market Priority:** **MODERATE**
- **Strategy:** Hub federation approach rather than competitive displacement
