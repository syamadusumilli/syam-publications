*The expansion transition test: scaling a proven pilot while Medicaid cuts threaten the coverage gains that made transformation possible.*

## Introduction

Missouri received **$216.3 million in FY2026 RHTP funding**, ranking ninth nationally in absolute award size. The state's 1.9 million rural residents translate to **$115 per rural resident**, placing Missouri 36th in per-capita allocation. This middle-tier positioning reflects a state that expanded Medicaid in 2021 but continues facing severe rural health infrastructure strain, with 27 hospitals at risk of closure and 12 at immediate risk within two to three years.

Missouri's RHTP approach builds on an existing pilot program called **ToRCH** (Transformation of Rural Community Health), which launched in July 2024 with six hospital hubs coordinating social determinants of health interventions for Medicaid enrollees. The state plans to scale this model statewide while adding workforce development, infrastructure grants, and a $364 million digital backbone that represents the largest single item in Missouri's nearly $1 billion five-year request.

The central question for Missouri: **Can recent Medicaid expansion combined with RHTP investment stabilize a rural health system that lost 11 hospitals since 2014?**

## Rural Health Landscape

Missouri's rural health system spans **57 rural hospitals** serving communities across the Ozarks, the Bootheel, and agricultural counties stretching from the Iowa border to the Arkansas line. The geography creates distinct regional challenges: the Ozark plateau's isolation, the Mississippi Delta poverty concentrated in the Bootheel, and the depopulating agricultural counties of northern Missouri.

**Healthcare Infrastructure**

| Facility Type | Count | Context |
|---------------|-------|---------|
| Rural hospitals | 57 | 27 at risk (47%), 12 at immediate risk (21%) |
| Critical Access Hospitals | 36 | Primary safety net for isolated communities |
| Rural Health Clinics | 180+ | Uneven distribution across counties |
| FQHCs (rural sites) | 45+ | Growing role in primary care delivery |
| Hospital closures since 2014 | 11 | 12 total since 2010 per some counts |

**Workforce Shortages**

Missouri's primary care physician ratio stands at **47 per 100,000** in rural areas compared to 78 per 100,000 in metropolitan areas and 52 per 100,000 nationally for rural communities. The state ranks 38th nationally in overall health outcomes, driven by poor health behaviors, limited care access, and high chronic disease prevalence.

The majority of Missouri's rural counties carry **Health Professional Shortage Area designations** for primary care, dental, and mental health services. Workforce turnover reached 19.5% from 2015 to 2019, and the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated departures. Missouri remains one of 11 states restricting nurse practitioners from practicing independently, limiting one potential solution to physician shortages.

**Health Outcomes**

| Metric | Missouri Rural | Context |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| Overall health ranking | 38th nationally | Driven by behaviors, access gaps |
| Chronic disease burden | Above national average | Diabetes, heart disease, obesity |
| Maternal health outcomes | Poor relative standing | Obstetric unit closures compound access |
| Aging population | 20% 65+ by 2030 | 29% increase from 2012 baseline |

The **Bootheel region** in southeast Missouri mirrors conditions in the Mississippi Delta: persistent poverty, high chronic disease prevalence, and collapsing access infrastructure. The Ozarks face different challenges: extreme isolation, mountainous terrain limiting transportation, and economies dependent on tourism and agriculture rather than stable employment with health benefits.

## RHTP Award and Context

**Funding Position**

| Metric | Value | National Rank |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| FY2026 Award | $216,276,818 | 9th |
| Five-Year Projection | ~$1.08 billion | Dependent on performance |
| Rural Population | 1.88 million | 31% of state population |
| Per Rural Resident | $115 | 36th |
| Baseline Allocation | $100 million | Equal across all states |
| Workload Allocation | $116.3 million | Based on rurality and application score |

Missouri's award reflects moderate rurality metrics combined with a strong technical application score. The state leveraged its existing ToRCH pilot as evidence of implementation capacity, and CMS cited ToRCH as a replicable model in RHTP application guidance.

**Medicaid Context**

Missouri expanded Medicaid in **August 2021** following a 2020 ballot initiative that voters approved despite legislative opposition. Expansion added approximately 275,000 Missourians to coverage, including rural residents previously trapped in the coverage gap. The expansion arrived late compared to early-adopter states but provides a foundation that non-expansion states like Texas and Mississippi lack.

However, Medicaid cuts under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act threaten to erode these gains. Missouri faces projected reductions in federal Medicaid spending that could cost the state **130,000 to 170,000 in coverage losses** over the next decade. Rural hospitals, where Medicaid and Medicare account for 78% of patient payments at some facilities, face compounding pressure from reduced reimbursement.

**The Medicaid Math**

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Expansion coverage gains (2021-2025) | ~275,000 added |
| Projected coverage losses (2026-2035) | 130,000 to 170,000 |
| Rural hospital Medicaid dependence | 40% to 78% of payments |
| RHTP offset potential | Partial at best |

RHTP funding cannot legally backfill Medicaid cuts. Missouri's $216 million annual award arrives as Medicaid reductions begin eroding the coverage base that expansion created. The net position remains uncertain: whether transformation investments outpace coverage erosion depends on implementation speed and cut severity.

## State Approach

Missouri's RHTP strategy centers on **ToRCH Care** (Transformation of Rural Community Health), scaling a proven pilot into statewide infrastructure while adding workforce development and technology modernization.

**Governance Structure**

| Agency | Role |
|--------|------|
| Missouri Department of Social Services (DSS) | Lead agency, cooperative agreement holder |
| MO HealthNet Division | Implementation lead, existing ToRCH administrator |
| Department of Health and Senior Services (DHSS) | Workforce programs, Office of Rural Health |
| Department of Mental Health (DMH) | Behavioral health integration |

**Strategic Framework**

Missouri's theory of change assumes that addressing **social determinants of health** at the community level will reduce emergency department utilization, improve chronic disease management, and generate Medicaid savings that can sustain rural health infrastructure beyond 2030. The ToRCH pilot demonstrated early results: six hub hospitals coordinated care for nearly 2,800 individuals through the Unite Us platform since July 2024, connecting them to over 900 community services.

**Five Priority Areas**

Missouri organized its approach around five interconnected areas: regional networks and community hubs aligning hospitals, behavioral health providers, clinics, EMS, public health, and social service organizations across seven coordinating networks and dozens of multi-county hubs; workforce pipeline development through training programs, loan repayment expansion, and recruitment incentives targeting rural shortage areas; infrastructure modernization through grants for hospital infrastructure projects and service line additions; a statewide digital backbone for referral coordination, data sharing, and performance tracking; and wellness and prevention initiatives addressing nutrition, fitness, and chronic disease prevention aligned with MAHA priorities.

## Program and Funding Distribution

**Program Allocation Table**

| Program | FY2026 Allocation (Est.) | Implementing Organization | Focus |
|---------|-------------------------|--------------------------|-------|
| Digital Backbone/Technology Infrastructure | $72.8M (first year of $364M total) | DSS/MO HealthNet, Unite Us | Referral platform, data exchange, analytics |
| Community Hub Expansion | $45M | MO HealthNet via hospital hubs | Scale ToRCH from 6 to 40+ hubs |
| Regional Coordinating Networks | $25M | 7 regional networks (TBD) | Cross-county coordination, strategy |
| Workforce Development | $30M | DHSS Office of Rural Health | Loan repayment, training, recruitment |
| Infrastructure Grants | $20M | DSS competitive grants | 10 hospital projects, 3 service additions |
| Rural Health Transformation Office | $8M | DSS | 20 to 25 staff, program administration |
| Wellness/Prevention Initiatives | $15M | DHSS, DMH | MAHA-aligned nutrition and fitness programs |

*Allocations estimated from state application and news reporting. Official initiative-specific budgets pending CMS finalization.*

**Staffing Plan**

Missouri plans to hire **more than 100 people** for RHTP implementation: approximately 90 staff assigned to community hubs (roughly 2 to 3 per hub), 20 to 25 staff for seven regional coordinating networks, and Rural Health Transformation Office administrative personnel.

**Funding Flow Structure**

CMS Award flows to Missouri DSS as Lead Agency, then distributes to MO HealthNet Division (managing ToRCH Hub Hospitals via direct payments, Unite Us technology platform, and CBO capacity building grants), DHSS Office of Rural Health (managing workforce loan repayment, competitive infrastructure grants, and wellness program implementation), seven Regional Coordinating Networks (managing cross-county strategy and coordination), and the Rural Health Transformation Office for administration.

## Social Care Integration

Missouri's application **centers social care integration as its core strategy**, building on ToRCH's social determinants focus. The state's theory of change explicitly assumes SDOH interventions generate Medicaid savings sufficient for sustainability.

| Component | Application Status | Funding Allocation | Survival Assessment |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| SDOH/HRSN Screening | Hub hospital requirement | Embedded in hub operations | Likely |
| HRSN Navigation | Core hub function | Part of $45M hub expansion | Likely |
| CHW Programs | Embedded in hub staffing | Part of hub allocations | At Risk |
| CIE Platform | Unite Us statewide | $364M digital backbone | Likely |

**Social Needs Coordination**: ToRCH hubs perform HRSN screening and coordinate social service referrals through Unite Us. The 88% of pilot respondents agreeing the program improves patient care suggests operational effectiveness, though cost savings data remains limited.

**Community Health Workers**: CHW deployment is embedded within hub staffing rather than funded as a distinct program. This creates vulnerability: if hub funding faces pressure, CHW positions may be among the first reduced. No separate CHW training pipeline funding is visible in program allocations.

**Technology Infrastructure**: The **$364 million digital backbone** represents Missouri's largest single investment. Unite Us provides the Community Information Exchange platform, enabling closed-loop referral tracking across hubs and CBOs. The platform's existing deployment in ToRCH provides proof of concept, reducing technology procurement risk compared to states starting fresh.

**CBO Capacity Building**: Missouri explicitly includes CBO capacity building grants to ensure social service partners can absorb referral volume. This addresses a common failure point where screening generates referrals that community organizations cannot fulfill.

**Survival Assessment**: Missouri's social care components have stronger survival prospects than most states because SDOH integration is foundational rather than supplementary. However, CHW deployment depends on hub operational budgets that could face pressure under partial funding scenarios.

## Key Subawardees

**Intermediary Organizations**

| Organization | Type | Role | Contract Status |
|--------------|------|------|-----------------|
| Missouri Hospital Association (MHA) | Statewide intermediary | Hospital engagement, technical assistance, policy coordination | Key stakeholder, formal contract TBD |
| Missouri Primary Care Association (MPCA) | Statewide intermediary | FQHC coordination, rural primary care network | Key stakeholder, formal contract TBD |
| Missouri Behavioral Health Council | Statewide intermediary | Behavioral health integration, DMH coordination | Key stakeholder, formal contract TBD |
| Unite Us | Technology vendor | Community Information Exchange platform | Existing contract, expansion anticipated |

**ToRCH Hub Hospitals (Existing Pilot)**

| Hospital | Location | County | Role |
|----------|----------|--------|------|
| Salem Memorial District Hospital | Salem | Dent | Hub hospital, social needs coordination |
| Golden Valley Memorial Healthcare | Clinton | Henry | Hub hospital, social needs coordination |
| Bothwell Regional Health Center | Sedalia | Pettis | Hub hospital, at-risk facility (largest employer, 1,000+ staff) |
| Citizens Memorial Hospital | Bolivar | Polk | Hub hospital, social needs coordination |
| Phelps Health | Rolla | Phelps | Hub hospital, regional anchor |
| Ray County Hospital | Richmond | Ray | Hub hospital, community grants focus |

**Anticipated Subawardees (RHTP Expansion)**

| Organization Type | Estimated Recipients | Funding Role |
|-------------------|---------------------|--------------|
| Additional hub hospitals | 30 to 40 facilities | Community hub operations, $500K to $1.5M annually each |
| Regional health systems | 5 to 7 systems | Coordinating network leads, $2M to $4M annually each |
| FQHCs (rural) | 20 to 30 sites | Primary care expansion, workforce |
| Community-based organizations | 100+ | Social services delivery, CBO capacity building |
| University partners | 2 to 3 institutions | Workforce training, telehealth, research |

## Assessment

**Strengths**

**Proven pilot foundation.** Missouri's ToRCH program launched 18 months before RHTP awards, generating early outcome data and operational experience. CMS cited ToRCH as a model, and Unite Us released evaluation data showing 88% of respondents agreed the program improves patient care. This head start positions Missouri to scale faster than states building from scratch.

**Recent expansion stabilization.** Medicaid expansion in 2021 added 275,000 Missourians to coverage and reduced uncompensated care burdens on rural hospitals. While expansion arrived later than optimal, it provides a coverage foundation that non-expansion states lack. The expansion voter mandate also creates political durability that legislative action alone would not.

**Strong stakeholder alignment.** MHA, MPCA, and the Behavioral Health Council participated in application development and publicly support implementation. Jon Doolittle, MHA President and CEO, called the award a "visionary and successful application" and committed to "facilitating hospital input so implementation reflects real-world needs." This stakeholder buy-in reduces implementation friction.

**SDOH-centered strategy.** Unlike states treating social care as supplementary, Missouri positions SDOH integration as foundational. The ToRCH model builds hub operations around social needs coordination rather than adding it as an afterthought.

**Vulnerabilities**

**Medicaid cut exposure.** Missouri's rural hospitals depend heavily on Medicaid and Medicare revenue. Bothwell Regional Health Center in Sedalia reported 78% of patient payments came from these programs in 2024. Federal Medicaid cuts beginning in 2026 will erode the coverage gains expansion created, potentially eliminating 130,000 to 170,000 Missourians from coverage over the decade. RHTP cannot legally offset these losses.

**Hospital closure trajectory.** With 27 hospitals at risk (47%) and 12 at immediate risk (21%), Missouri faces one of the nation's most severe closure trajectories. Eight additional hospitals moved to immediate risk status between 2024 and 2025 assessments. RHTP infrastructure grants ($20M in FY2026) cannot stabilize facilities operating at structural losses.

**Digital backbone dependency.** The $364 million digital backbone represents over one-third of Missouri's five-year request. If technology procurement delays or interoperability challenges emerge, the entire hub coordination model loses its operational foundation. Missouri's rural hospitals have varied IT capacity, and integration across 40+ hubs plus hundreds of CBOs presents substantial technical risk.

**CHW sustainability.** Community health workers are embedded in hub operations without distinct funding streams. If hub budgets face pressure, CHW positions represent soft costs easily reduced. No dedicated CHW training pipeline protects this workforce component.

**Sustainability Prospects**

Missouri's shared savings model assumes that upstream interventions in social determinants will generate Medicaid cost reductions sufficient to sustain hub operations beyond 2030. The theory is plausible but unproven at scale. ToRCH pilot data shows service coordination but has not yet demonstrated the cost savings necessary for long-term self-sustainability.

The state's legislative appropriation of **$15 million annually for ToRCH** (ongoing since 2023) provides a state funding commitment independent of RHTP. However, only $8 million had been spent by end of FY2025, suggesting implementation capacity constraints that could affect RHTP scale-up.

**Critical Success Factors**

1. **Hub expansion speed.** Scaling from 6 to 40+ hubs within two years requires rapid hospital recruitment, CBO engagement, and platform deployment.

2. **Technology platform performance.** Unite Us must integrate across diverse hospital IT systems while maintaining the referral tracking that makes closed-loop coordination possible.

3. **Workforce pipeline results.** Missouri's primary care shortage will not resolve within the RHTP window. Success requires measurable progress on recruitment and retention metrics.

4. **Medicaid cut mitigation.** State and federal policy decisions on Medicaid implementation will determine whether coverage gains survive. RHTP cannot solve a problem it is prohibited from addressing.

5. **Shared savings demonstration.** Missouri's sustainability model requires evidence that SDOH interventions reduce Medicaid costs. Without this proof, the 2030 cliff becomes a real discontinuation risk.

## Conclusion

Missouri occupies the transition space between expansion and non-expansion states, between pilot success and scaled implementation, between coverage gains and coverage erosion. The state's $216 million award and ToRCH foundation create genuine transformation potential. The 27 hospitals at risk and impending Medicaid cuts create genuine transformation urgency.

The SDOH-centered strategy positions Missouri as a test case for whether social care integration at scale can improve health outcomes and generate cost savings. If ToRCH's early results scale effectively, Missouri demonstrates that addressing social needs through hospital hubs produces measurable value. If shared savings fail to materialize, the state faces a 2030 cliff with no sustainability mechanism.

**What to Watch**

- Hub expansion timeline and hospital participation rates
- Unite Us platform performance across diverse rural IT environments
- Bothwell Regional Health Center's financial trajectory as a bellwether for at-risk facilities
- State legislative response to federal Medicaid implementation
- Whether shared savings materialize at levels supporting post-2030 sustainability

Missouri's experience will answer whether **recent Medicaid expansion combined with RHTP investment can reverse rural health decline** or merely slow its acceleration. The state has advantages many lack: a proven pilot, stakeholder alignment, and expansion coverage. Whether these advantages overcome structural headwinds depends on execution speed and policy decisions beyond Missouri's control.
