Part 1 established the baseline: **$206.9 million for 2.4 million rural Tennesseans** translates to $86 per person annually, ranking Tennessee in the lower third of per-capita allocations despite the **highest rural hospital closure rate per capita** in the nation. Sixteen rural communities lost inpatient care since 2010. Forty-four percent of remaining rural hospitals face closure risk. The coverage gap traps 250,000 to 300,000 Tennesseans between Medicaid eligibility and marketplace subsidies. East Tennessee operates under the **Ballad Health monopoly**, complicating any regional transformation strategy.

Tennessee responded with a comprehensive transformation plan organized around five strategic goals: **rural healthcare transformation, maternal and child health, making rural Tennessee healthy again, technology infrastructure, and workforce development**. The application leverages Tennessee's existing infrastructure, including the **Tennessee Community Compass** closed-loop referral system, County Health Councils in all 95 counties, and the Healthcare Resiliency Program grant model established under Governor Lee's administration.

The strategic approach reflects Tennessee's particular constraints. With limited state funding appetite and continued Medicaid non-expansion, RHTP represents the primary vehicle for rural health investment. Tennessee positioned itself as a potential national model, emphasizing **locally-led solutions** through County Health Councils rather than top-down state mandates. The theory of change assumes that empowering local communities to identify and address their own health priorities produces more sustainable transformation than state-directed programming.

**The central premise**: locally-led transformation, supported by technology infrastructure and state coordination, can produce meaningful improvement in rural health outcomes without Medicaid expansion and despite inadequate per-capita funding. Whether this premise holds will determine if Tennessee's 2.4 million rural residents see genuine healthcare transformation or another cycle of demonstration projects that expire with federal funding.

## The Strategic Framework

### Governance Structure

The **Tennessee Department of Health (TDH)** serves as lead agency for all RHTP implementation. The Commissioner of Health bears statutory responsibility for program administration, reporting, and compliance with CMS cooperative agreement requirements.

TDH established governance infrastructure building on existing mechanisms:

| Role | Function |
|------|----------|
| Commissioner of Health | Ultimate accountability, policy direction |
| Assistant Commissioner for Health Services | RHTP program oversight |
| Director of Rural Health | Day-to-day management, CMS liaison |
| Initiative Coordinators | Subject-matter leads for each strategic goal |
| Regional Liaisons | Coordination across three grand divisions |
| County Health Councils | Local implementation and priority-setting |

The governance structure intentionally **decentralizes implementation** while centralizing accountability. Unlike states that concentrate decision-making at the state level, Tennessee channels substantial authority to County Health Councils, the network of 95 local bodies charged with assessing community health needs and implementing local solutions. This creates a hub-and-spoke model where TDH provides funding, technical assistance, and coordination while counties determine priorities within state frameworks.

The **Healthcare Resiliency Program (HRP)** serves as the primary subaward mechanism. HRP has distributed grants to rural healthcare facilities since 2021, creating an established competitive process that RHTP will scale substantially. Providers, community organizations, and local health departments apply for HRP grants through standardized processes with TDH oversight.

### Theory of Change

The Tennessee application operates on a **locally-led, technology-enabled theory of change**. The logic model:

1. **Local communities understand their own needs best.** County Health Councils conduct health assessments and identify priorities. State resources support local implementation rather than imposing uniform solutions.

2. **Technology extends capacity without requiring workforce expansion.** Telehealth, eConsult platforms, remote monitoring, and the Healthcare Resource Tracking System (HRTS) allow existing providers to serve larger populations. Closed-loop referral systems connect clinical care to social services.

3. **Prevention reduces downstream costs.** The MAHA-aligned wellness focus addresses chronic disease through nutrition, physical activity, and health-promoting environments before clinical intervention becomes necessary.

4. **Workforce pipelines require immediate investment for future returns.** Residency expansion, scholarship programs, and early exposure initiatives produce providers over time. Short-term bridge support through Community Health Workers provides immediate capacity while pipelines mature.

5. **Regional coordination creates efficiency.** Healthcare Coalitions, Medical Operations Coordination Centers, and hub-and-spoke networks reduce duplication and ensure resources reach underserved areas.

The theory's vulnerabilities include reliance on County Health Council capacity that varies dramatically across Tennessee's 95 counties, technology prerequisites in broadband and digital literacy that remain unmet in significant portions of rural Tennessee, and the fundamental coverage gap that prevents transformed systems from serving patients who cannot afford care.

### Core Initiatives and Interrelationships

Tennessee organizes seventeen distinct initiatives across five strategic goals. The initiatives form interconnected layers:

**Goal 1: Rural Healthcare Transformation** addresses infrastructure, emergency services, EMS capacity, and regional coordination. This foundation enables clinical care delivery.

**Goal 2: Maternal and Child Health** builds on Goal 1 infrastructure to address Tennessee's particularly severe maternal health crisis through targeted investments in birthing facilities, perinatal quality improvement, and postpartum care coordination.

**Goal 3: Make Rural Tennessee Healthy Again** addresses upstream prevention through competitive grants, health-promoting environments, nutrition infrastructure, and transportation solutions.

**Goal 4: Technology Infrastructure** provides the digital backbone connecting all other goals through Health Information Exchange, closed-loop referral expansion, eConsult platforms, and health technology innovation.

**Goal 5: Workforce Development** addresses the persistent constraint limiting all other transformation efforts through pipeline development, behavioral health expansion, CHW acceleration, dental workforce, and executive leadership development.

Tennessee does not specify exact CHW FTE targets but focuses on **organizational accreditation** as the pathway to sustainable CHW deployment. The target of 20 accredited CHW organizations by end of RHTP suggests capacity for 60-100+ CHWs statewide.

**Employer and Clinical Supervision**

CHW employers include provider organizations achieving TNCHWA accreditation. Clinical supervision requirements will be established through accreditation standards developed in partnership with NCQA.

**Geographic Deployment**

CHW deployment prioritizes high-need rural communities as determined by local provider organizations achieving accreditation.

### Community Information Exchange and Referral Platforms

Tennessee has **already procured a CIE platform** through competitive process. **Findhelp** operates **Tennessee Community Compass**, branded for statewide deployment.

**Platform Operations**

Tennessee Community Compass is operated jointly by TennCare, TDH, and Findhelp. The Rural Health Association of Tennessee leads CBO onboarding efforts in rural areas.

**Interoperability**

The platform integrates with:

- TennCare Managed Care Organization case management systems
- Key provider partner EHRs
- State agency systems (with RHTP funding for 4 new agency integrations)

**Resource Directory Maintenance**

Findhelp maintains the community resource directory with ongoing updates. CBOs self-register and update their program information through the platform.

### Technology Vendor Landscape

**Current SDOH/CIE Platform**

**Findhelp** is the sole contracted vendor for Tennessee Community Compass, selected through competitive procurement. Findhelp has operated in Tennessee since 2015 and serves multiple customers including TennCare's three Medicaid MCOs (Amerigroup, BlueCare, UnitedHealthcare).

**Vendor Status**

Procurement is complete. Implementation is ongoing with RHTP funds supporting significant scale expansion.

**Vendor Gaps**

The Findhelp platform is comprehensive for closed-loop referral functionality. Potential gaps exist in:

- Advanced analytics and predictive modeling for SDOH intervention
- Integration with non-healthcare state systems (SNAP, TANF, child welfare)
- Real-time social needs fulfillment (immediate food delivery, emergency shelter placement)

## Social Care Integration Table

| Component | Status | Funding (Est.) | Survival Probability |
|-----------|--------|----------------|---------------------|
| SDOH Screening | Embedded via TNCC | $2-3M | High |
| HRSN Navigation | 21 LHD navigators | $4-5M | Moderate-High |
| CHW Deployment | 20 org accreditation | $8-10M | Moderate |
| CIE Platform (TNCC) | Operational, scaling | $5-6M | High |
| Transportation | RNET program | $6-8M | Moderate |
| Food/Nutrition Access | HBE/PSE grants | $4-5M | Moderate |

## Budget Flow and Timeline

### Allocation Across Initiatives

Tennessee's $206.9 million FY2026 award distributes across five strategic goals:

| Goal | Estimated Allocation | Percentage |
|------|---------------------|------------|
| Goal 1: Rural Healthcare Transformation | $68-75M | 33-36% |
| Goal 2: Maternal and Child Health | $21-26M | 10-13% |
| Goal 3: Make Rural Tennessee Healthy Again | $34-42M | 16-20% |
| Goal 4: Technology Infrastructure | $23-28M | 11-14% |
| Goal 5: Workforce Development | $38-45M | 18-22% |
| Program Administration | $15-18M | 7-9% |

### Subaward Structure

Tennessee utilizes multiple subaward mechanisms:

**Healthcare Resiliency Program (HRP)**: Competitive grants to hospitals, clinics, and CBOs. Approximately 50-60% of program funds flow through HRP grants.

**County Health Council Grants**: Direct awards to all 89 rural County Health Councils for locally-determined priorities.

**Academic Partnerships**: Directed awards to universities and AHECs for workforce development.

**State Agency Operations**: Direct TDH operations for LHD services, technology infrastructure, and program coordination.

### Administrative Retention

TDH retains approximately **7-9% for program administration**, including:

- RHTP Program Office staffing (20 FTE)
- Evaluation and data management
- CMS reporting and compliance
- Technical assistance to subawardees
- Statewide coordination activities

### Performance Monitoring

Tennessee implements multi-level performance monitoring:

**State Level**: TDH tracks aggregate metrics across all initiatives, reporting quarterly to CMS and Governor's office.

**Initiative Level**: Initiative coordinators monitor component-specific metrics with monthly dashboards.

**Subawardee Level**: HRP grantees report quarterly on deliverables and outcomes through standardized reporting templates.

### Two-Year Obligation Requirement

Tennessee's implementation timeline ensures substantial obligation within the two-year federal requirement:

**Year 1 (FY2026)**: Program launch, initial HRP grant cycles, technology infrastructure procurement, workforce program establishment

**Year 2 (FY2027)**: Scale implementation, second HRP grant cycles, full TNCC deployment, expanded regional coordination

## What the Plan Assumes

### Explicit Assumptions

The Tennessee application makes several explicit assumptions:

1. **County Health Councils have capacity to implement local initiatives.** The plan relies heavily on 95 local councils with varying organizational capacity.

2. **Tennessee Community Compass achieves statewide adoption.** SDOH integration depends on provider and CBO participation in the Findhelp platform.

3. **Broadband infrastructure exists or will be built.** Technology initiatives assume connectivity that remains unavailable in significant portions of rural Tennessee.

4. **Workforce pipeline graduates will practice in Tennessee.** Training investments assume retention rates that historical data does not guarantee.

5. **Local Health Departments can expand clinical services.** Direct service expansion assumes LHD capacity beyond traditional public health functions.

### Implicit Assumptions

The plan implicitly assumes:

1. **Coverage gaps do not fundamentally undermine transformation.** Tennessee proceeds without Medicaid expansion, assuming RHTP investment can improve health outcomes despite 250,000+ residents lacking coverage.

2. **Medicaid cuts will not accelerate hospital closures faster than RHTP can build resilience.** The plan does not model scenarios where federal cuts outpace transformation investment.

3. **Ballad Health will cooperate with regional transformation efforts.** East Tennessee initiatives assume coordination with a monopoly provider with mixed performance record.

4. **Legislative action will support HIE and related initiatives.** Several technology components require enabling legislation that may not pass.

5. **Political continuity enables multi-year implementation.** Tennessee's 2026 gubernatorial race creates uncertainty about continued policy direction.

### Dependencies on External Factors

- **BEAD Program broadband buildout** on timelines compatible with RHTP technology deployment
- **TennCare MCO cooperation** in Community Compass expansion and CHW reimbursement
- **Academic institution capacity** to expand residency and training programs
- **CBO network capacity** to accept and respond to referrals at proposed scale
- **State general fund stability** to avoid cuts to complementary programs

### Risks Acknowledged Versus Ignored

**Acknowledged**:
- Workforce shortages require immediate and sustained investment
- Technology deployment requires training and workflow integration
- Regional variation requires flexible, locally-adapted approaches

**Ignored**:
- Medicaid non-expansion fundamentally limits population health impact
- Federal Medicaid cuts may exceed RHTP's offsetting capacity
- 2030 funding cliff creates sustainability challenges for initiatives dependent on federal support
- Ballad Health monopoly may impede East Tennessee transformation

## Conclusion

Tennessee proposes a comprehensive transformation strategy leveraging existing infrastructure, including County Health Councils, Tennessee Community Compass, and the Healthcare Resiliency Program model. The five-goal framework addresses healthcare transformation, maternal health, prevention, technology, and workforce through seventeen interconnected initiatives distributing approximately $207 million across competitive grants, direct services, and technology deployment.

The **locally-led approach** distinguishes Tennessee's strategy from more centralized models. County Health Councils provide community-level priority-setting. The HRP competitive grant structure identifies capable implementers. Technology infrastructure creates connective tissue linking local efforts to statewide systems.

The plan's vulnerabilities center on coverage and sustainability. Tennessee proceeds without Medicaid expansion, assuming RHTP investment can produce health improvement despite the coverage gap. The 2030 funding cliff looms over initiatives requiring ongoing support. Workforce pipelines produce providers after federal funding ends.

Part 3 of this analysis assesses whether the plan can succeed: what works, what struggles, what gets cut when plans meet reality, and whether transformation gains can outpace the erosion that Medicaid cuts and continued hospital closures will impose.
