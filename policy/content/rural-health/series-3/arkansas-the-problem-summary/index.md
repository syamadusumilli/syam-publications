Arkansas will receive $208.8 million in fiscal year 2026, the first installment of approximately $1 billion over five years through the Rural Health Transformation Program. This award places Arkansas ninth nationally and reflects a statistical paradox: the state has the **highest percentage of rural hospitals vulnerable to closure in the nation at 50%**, yet only one rural hospital has closed since 2014. That single closure, De Queen Medical Center, occurred while 59 rural hospitals shuttered in six surrounding non-expansion states. Texas lost 26, Missouri 13, Oklahoma 10. Arkansas lost one.

The difference is Medicaid expansion. Arkansas expanded coverage in 2014 through its Arkansas Health and Opportunity for Me program, using a private option model to cover adults up to 138% of the federal poverty level. That expansion reduced uncompensated care costs, improved operating margins, and prevented the closure cascade that devastated neighboring states. The policy protection that saved Arkansas's rural hospitals now faces systematic dismantling. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act of 2025 imposes **$911 billion in Medicaid cuts over ten years**, introduces work requirements beginning January 2027, and phases down enhanced federal matching rates for expansion populations. Arkansas will receive approximately $1 billion in RHTP funding over five years while facing an estimated **$155 billion in reduced federal Medicaid spending** over the same decade.

Arkansas is not applying for RHTP funding because its hospitals are closing. Arkansas is applying because the policy that kept hospitals open is being withdrawn, and transformation funding cannot replace what Medicaid expansion provided. The state must now attempt to build new health system capacity while the financial foundation supporting existing infrastructure erodes faster than replacements can be constructed.

Arkansas's rural health crisis is measured by persistent vulnerability rather than realized collapse. Chartis 2025 data identifies **30 of 47 rural hospitals with inpatient services** operating under financial stress that places them at risk. Eleven hospitals face immediate closure risk, defined as facilities unable to sustain losses for more than two to three years. These hospitals have exhausted reserves and cannot absorb further revenue declines without shuttering or converting to non-inpatient models. The infrastructure serves 1.3 million rural Arkansans, approximately 41% of the state's population living in 54 of 75 counties classified as rural. The network includes 5 Critical Access Hospitals, 5 Rural Emergency Hospitals, 149 Rural Health Clinics, 163 Federally Qualified Health Center sites, and approximately 20 short-term or prospective payment system hospitals in rural areas.

The Arkansas Delta presents the most acute crisis within the crisis. Fourteen Delta counties qualify as areas of persistent poverty with persistent child poverty. Life expectancy in Mississippi County is 71.5 years, more than four years below the national average. Infant mortality in the Delta exceeds 8 per 1,000 live births compared to 7.2 per 1,000 in urban Arkansas. Economic decline has accelerated population exodus, leaving behind older, sicker, poorer residents with fewer healthcare options. Between 2010 and 2024, multiple Delta counties lost 10% or more of their population. The challenges are structural and generational: agricultural mechanization eliminated jobs decades ago, manufacturing never replaced farming at comparable scale, and the tax base erodes as property values decline and population shrinks. Hospitals in the Delta serve populations unable to pay for care and unable to fund local government supplements that sustain public facilities elsewhere. **Self-pay rates are high, Medicare and Medicaid dominate payer mix, and both reimburse below cost**. The RHTP cannot reverse Delta economic decline, restore population, or rebuild tax bases. It can only attempt to sustain healthcare access for those who remain.

Workforce shortages compound infrastructure fragility. More than 60% of Health Professional Shortage Areas nationally are in rural locations, and Arkansas concentrates its limited physician workforce in Little Rock, Fayetteville, and a handful of regional centers. Rural surgeon shortages are particularly acute. Medical school graduates face $200,000 or more in debt and choose urban practices with higher salaries and professional advancement opportunities. Rural hospitals cannot compete on compensation, and loan repayment programs cover only a fraction of debt.

Health outcomes in Arkansas rank among the worst in America. The 2025 America's Health Rankings report places Arkansas **49th nationally**, down from 48th in 2024. The state has never ranked higher than 40th. Cardiovascular disease death rate stands at 231 per 100,000, third highest nationally. Diabetes death rate is 30 per 100,000, third highest nationally. Obesity prevalence is 37% of adults. Life expectancy is approximately 72.5 years, 3.2 years below the national average. Arkansas scores below the national average on 37 of 55 measures tracked and better than average on only 14. Cost barriers prevent care seeking even when services are available. The percentage of adults who reported avoiding healthcare due to cost rose from 11.7% in 2021 to **15.3% in 2024**, a 31% increase. In rural counties, this figure exceeds 20%.

Arkansas's RHTP award of $208,779,396 for fiscal year 2026 places the state above the national average of $200 million. On a per capita basis, Arkansas will receive approximately **$161 per rural resident in fiscal year 2026** and roughly $770 per rural resident over five years if the full request is funded. The state's application proposes four major initiatives totaling approximately $1 billion. HEART (Healthy Eating, Active Recreation, and Transformation) requests approximately $150 million for community-driven approaches to nutrition, physical activity, and chronic disease management, integrating school programs, faith-based organizations, and healthcare education. PACT (Promoting Access Coordination and Transformation) is the largest initiative at approximately $393 to $400 million, focusing on specialty care integration, preventive screenings, telehealth expansion, and Clinically Integrated Networks to improve data sharing and regional collaboration. RISE (Recruitment Innovation Skills and Education for Arkansas) requests approximately $161.5 million for workforce development, expanding residencies, increasing medical school rotation slots, and creating recruitment and retention incentives. THRIVE (Telehealth Health Monitoring and Response Innovation for Vital Expansion) focuses on technology infrastructure, patient-centered artificial intelligence applications, and evidence-based prevention programs.

The per-facility math reveals the challenge. If $209 million in FY2026 were distributed equally among Arkansas's approximately 47 rural hospitals with inpatient services, each would receive less than $4.5 million. Actual distribution will prioritize certain hospitals and programs over others. **The 11 hospitals at immediate closure risk cannot all be rescued with available funds**. Choices must be made.

Arkansas's Medicaid expansion through ARHOME covers approximately 231,000 Arkansans as of December 2024, down from a peak of 342,000. Total Medicaid enrollment exceeds 821,000 Arkansans, representing nearly one in three residents. In rural Arkansas, 41% of Medicaid enrollees live in communities served by vulnerable hospitals. The expansion prevented rural hospital collapse between 2014 and 2025, and the causal mechanism is straightforward: expansion reduced uncompensated care by providing coverage to previously uninsured patients, improving hospital operating margins.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act's Medicaid cuts include work requirements beginning January 2027 (potentially as early as January 2026 in states that choose earlier implementation), reduced federal matching rates for expansion populations, more frequent eligibility redeterminations every six months instead of annually, reduced retroactive coverage from 90 days to 60 days, and out-of-pocket costs for certain services beginning October 2028. Arkansas has experience with Medicaid work requirements. In 2018, Arkansas became the first state to implement work requirements for Medicaid expansion enrollees. Within seven months, **18,000 Arkansans lost coverage**, many for administrative reasons rather than failure to work. Research published in the New England Journal of Medicine found no increase in employment among the affected population. The requirements were struck down by federal courts in 2019.

The new federal work requirements are statutory rather than administratively imposed, meaning courts cannot strike them down on the same grounds. Projected coverage losses are severe. Estimates suggest **114,000 Arkansans**, approximately 14% of current Medicaid enrollment, could lose coverage through the combined effects of work requirements, more frequent eligibility redeterminations, and reduced retroactive coverage. Rural residents face disproportionate risk because work requirements are harder to satisfy in areas with limited employment options, transportation challenges, unreliable internet access for reporting compliance, and seasonal or irregular work patterns common in agriculture.

The Medicaid cuts create a fiscal trap. Arkansas cannot use RHTP funding to backfill Medicaid revenue losses because the program explicitly prohibits such use. Rural hospitals will lose Medicaid revenue while RHTP funding
