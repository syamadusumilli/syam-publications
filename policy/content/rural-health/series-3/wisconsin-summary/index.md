Wisconsin received $203.7 million in FY2026 Rural Health Transformation Program funding, ranking 23rd nationally and positioning slightly above the $200 million average despite lacking the extreme rural dispersal that benefited frontier states. The allocation reflects Wisconsin's substantial rural population of 2.14 million residents (36.3% of the state total) and robust healthcare infrastructure anchored by 60 Critical Access Hospitals, 217 Rural Health Clinics, and 280 Federally Qualified Health Centers. The state requested $1 billion over five years and may receive up to $18 million beyond that request, creating what the Department of Health Services calls an opportunity to ensure **"the right providers, empowered by the right technology, and supported by the right networks"** serve rural Wisconsin.

The application arrived in the aftermath of January 2024 hospital closures that exposed the fragility underlying Wisconsin's seemingly strong rural health infrastructure. Hospital Sisters Health System withdrew completely from western Wisconsin, closing Sacred Heart Hospital in Eau Claire (serving patients since the 1880s), St. Joseph's Hospital in Chippewa Falls, and 19 Prevea Health clinics across the Chippewa Valley. The closures eliminated emergency rooms, hospital beds, critical care capacity, and inpatient behavioral health services that no other regional facility could absorb. Over 1,000 healthcare workers lost employment. Even a $15 million state appropriation for behavioral health services could not sustain facilities where two-thirds of patients relied on Medicare and Medicaid reimbursing below operational costs. DHS Secretary Kirsten Johnson explicitly referenced the closure impact in the RHTP application, noting that **patients were forced to find new providers** while remaining facilities struggled to absorb demand.

Wisconsin's formula position near the national average reflects offsetting factors. The substantial rural population, extensive CAH network, and unique Medicaid structure (the only non-expansion state without a coverage gap) strengthen the application, while population density higher than frontier states and moderate rurality scores compared to Northern Plains states limit per-capita funding. The resulting **$95 per-capita rural allocation** falls far below Wyoming's $554 or Montana's $234 but exceeds dense states where rural populations represent smaller shares. Wisconsin cannot achieve the investment intensity of smaller states, but the absolute funding level enables statewide program implementation rather than regionally constrained pilots.

The state's Medicaid structure represents both strength and constraint for RHTP implementation. Under the BadgerCare Plus waiver established by former Governor Scott Walker, adults up to 100% of the federal poverty level receive coverage through the waiver, while adults from 100% to 138% FPL access premium tax credits in the Marketplace. This eliminates the coverage gap plaguing other non-expansion states like Texas or Georgia, where adults in that income band qualify for neither Medicaid nor subsidized Marketplace coverage. Some 198,000 childless adults enrolled in BadgerCare Plus as of January 2025 demonstrate the waiver's reach. However, Wisconsin forgoes approximately **$1.9 billion in federal matching funds per biennium** that full Medicaid expansion would provide, while paying a higher state share (39.9%) for the waiver population than the 10% state share expansion states pay. Governor Evers has proposed Medicaid expansion in four consecutive biennial budgets, with Republican legislative majorities blocking each attempt. The Wisconsin Policy Forum estimates expansion would save $1.7 billion over the biennium, including a $1.3 billion federal sign-on bonus. Federal work requirements beginning January 2027 will require community engagement for Medicaid adults, potentially affecting coverage continuity for rural Wisconsinites already enrolled.

Wisconsin organized RHTP funding across three interconnected initiatives totaling approximately $944 million over five years. The Rural Talent Recruitment and Retention initiative receives $337 million (36%), the Interoperability Infrastructure and Modernization initiative receives $329 million (35%), and the Population Health Infrastructure initiative receives $278.5 million (30%). This architecture addresses workforce, technology, and care delivery through integrated investments rather than isolated programs. The Department of Workforce Development will administer $150 million in rural workforce grants for regional workforce innovation. The Area Health Education Centers network, serving 7,000 learners annually with 500 field placements at 131 clinical sites, will expand health career apprenticeships including community health worker training. The University of Wisconsin System, Wisconsin Technical College System, Medical College of Wisconsin, and Marquette University will receive portions of $127 million for clinical training, simulation labs, allied health programs, teleconsultation infrastructure, and rural dental residency programs.

The most ambitious technology investment, the **$85 million Rural Health Care Collaborative**, will create shared digital infrastructure enabling smaller rural providers to access comprehensive longitudinal patient records, deploy chronic disease management tools, utilize patient-facing portals, access telehealth services and expanded care networks, implement closed-loop community service referral networks, and adopt artificial intelligence charting, medication management, and remote patient monitoring capabilities. Technical specifications will be developed with participating providers, with sustainability achieved through user fees for ongoing maintenance. DHS projects 60-plus providers at five or more care sites enrolled by Year 4. The collaborative addresses the fundamental interoperability gap preventing coordinated rural care, as smaller providers operating with what one county cited in the application described as "bubble gum and duct tape" cannot individually afford modern systems. Shared infrastructure creates economies of scale unavailable through facility-by-facility investment.

Wisconsin's community health worker initiative represents **the most explicitly sustainable social care investment** in any state application reviewed. The phased approach includes competitive grants for rural facilities to pilot CHW services during 2026-2027, an independent study of utilization, cost, impact, and return on investment from 2026-2028, and a Medicaid State Plan Amendment to cover CHW services beginning in 2028. The application cites Kentucky's CHW program demonstrating $11.33 return for every $1 spent over 25 years, with 10% reduction in emergency room visits and 23% reduction in inpatient admissions. Wisconsin expects similar returns will encourage private and public payors to cover services. Three nationally certified CHW training programs operate in Wisconsin, providing virtual and in-person core competency training, while the Wisconsin Association of Community Health Workers provides peer-to-peer learning and supervisor development. If successful, CHW services become permanent Medicaid benefits rather than grant-dependent programs, creating **the clearest post-RHTP funding stream** for social care integration in any reviewed application.

All 11 federally recognized Tribal Nations receive $500,000 annually ($27.5 million total) to implement the three Wisconsin RHTP initiatives in their communities. Tribal Nations may additionally apply for competitive grants under all three initiatives. The state will assign staff to ensure alignment with CMS-approved goals while respecting government-to-government relationships. The allocation recognizes that Tribal health clinics (14 statewide, with nine in fully rural counties) serve populations facing particular access challenges. Wisconsin designates 40 of 72 counties as mental health professional shortage areas, 37 as primary care shortage areas, and 34 as dental care shortage areas. The concentration of shortages in northern Wisconsin, where residents in counties like Florence, Forest, and Iron face travel times exceeding 60 minutes for emergency care, creates cascading effects. Rural residents experience higher suicide rates (17.0 versus 14.2 deaths per 100,000), higher self-harm injury rates in emergency departments, and fewer depression screenings during primary care visits.

Farmer mental health presents particular urgency in Wisconsin's agricultural economy. Surveys indicate 80% of farmers report financial issues impacting mental health, 82% cite weather or factors beyond their control, and 80% identify farm economy concerns. Wisconsin Farm Bureau and the Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection operate farmer wellness programs, but coverage remains limited. Manufacturing employs 20% of rural workers compared to 17% in urban areas, while the agricultural sector concentrates almost exclusively in rural counties. The combination creates occupational health challenges including machinery injuries, respiratory conditions, and chemical exposures that strain healthcare systems designed for lower-acuity populations. The absence of opioid treatment facilities in fully rural counties creates a treatment desert for substance use disorders, with 31 existing facilities concentrated in semi-rural and urban areas, forcing rural residents to travel substantial distances for medication-assisted treatment.

Wisconsin's healthcare infrastructure provides implementation platforms that states lacking provider density cannot replicate. The 60 Critical Access Hospitals anchor emergency and inpatient care, with 11 receiving recognition in the 2025 HRSA Medicare Beneficiary Quality Improvement Project for quality reporting and performance, ranking Wisconsin's CAHs among the top 10 nationally. The Wisconsin Office of Rural Health Flex Program supports CAH quality improvement, financial improvement, and operational activities. Some 65% of Wisconsin hospitals earn CMS four or five-star ratings versus 36% nationally, indicating existing quality foundation for transformation. However, the 2024 HSHS closures demonstrated that quality performance cannot overcome fundamental hospital
