Oregon's geography defines its rural health challenge. The state stretches 295 miles north to south and 395 miles east to west, covering 98,381 square miles of which 86% qualifies as rural or frontier terrain. Yet this vast geography concentrates relatively few people: approximately **1.5 million Oregonians live in rural and frontier communities**, representing 35% of the state's population spread across 10 frontier counties and portions of 26 additional counties classified as rural.

The state received **$197.3 million in first-year RHTP funding**, placing it in the middle tier nationally. For a state with Oregon's combination of geographic spread and moderate rural population, the per-capita calculation appears adequate for targeted interventions but insufficient for systemic transformation. The harder reality lies beneath the headline number: Oregon's rural hospitals have accumulated **$93 million in combined operating losses** over recent years, with one-third operating at negative margins.

## Rural Health Landscape

### Healthcare Infrastructure

Oregon maintains a rural healthcare infrastructure that appears robust on paper but faces significant financial stress:

| Facility Type | Count | Notes |
|---------------|-------|-------|
| Critical Access Hospitals | 25 | Core rural network |
| Rural Hospitals (Total) | 37 | Including larger rural facilities |
| Rural Health Clinics | 65+ | Primary care access points |
| Federally Qualified Health Centers | 35+ sites | Safety net providers |
| Coordinated Care Organizations | 16 | Regional Medicaid managed care |

The 25 Critical Access Hospitals form the backbone of Oregon's rural healthcare system, but their financial position has deteriorated substantially. **Approximately one-third of Oregon's rural hospitals operate at negative margins**, generating the $93 million in combined losses that threaten long-term sustainability. Cost-based reimbursement from Medicare provides some protection, but Medicaid rates and commercial payer negotiations often fail to cover actual costs of care delivery in low-volume settings.

### Workforce Crisis

Oregon's rural workforce shortages follow national patterns while reflecting regional dynamics. The state ranks among the worst nationally for **primary care access in rural areas**. Oregon Office of Rural Health data documents extensive Health Professional Shortage Areas across rural and frontier counties.

**Critical gaps include:**
- Primary care physicians
- Mental health professionals
- Dentists
- Specialty care access

Rural and frontier counties lose healthcare workers to larger urban centers, particularly Portland and the Willamette Valley. The recruitment challenge compounds retention difficulties: providers willing to work in rural Oregon often leave within five years for better compensation, professional development, or family considerations in urban areas.

### Geographic Isolation

Oregon's frontier designation captures what rural fails to convey. Ten counties qualify as frontier with **six or fewer people per square mile**. Residents in these areas face extraordinary distances to care:

- Eastern Oregon communities may travel **100+ miles** for hospital services
- Specialty care often requires trips to Portland, Bend, or Medford that consume entire days
- Emergency medical services struggle with response times across vast distances
- Air transport becomes essential for time-sensitive conditions

The state's topography compounds distance. The Cascade Range divides Oregon into distinct western and eastern regions with limited road connections. Winter weather regularly closes mountain passes, isolating eastern communities from western medical centers.

### Population Health Burden

**Chronic disease prevalence** runs higher in rural counties, with elevated rates of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic respiratory conditions. **Behavioral health needs** are acute, with rural suicide rates exceeding urban rates and substance use disorders straining limited treatment capacity. **Oral health access** remains severely limited, with multiple rural counties designated as dental care deserts.

The state's aging rural population accelerates these challenges. Seniors constitute a growing share of rural Oregon residents, bringing increased chronic disease burden and complex care needs to a system already stretched thin.

## RHTP Award and Context

| Metric | Oregon | National Average |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| FY2026 Award | $197.3 million | $200 million |
| Five-Year Projected Total | ~$986 million | ~$1 billion |
| Rural Population | ~1.5 million | Varies |
| Per-Capita (Rural) | ~$131 | ~$150 |
| Award Rank | 18th | N/A |

Oregon's per-capita figure of approximately **$131 reflects the formula's tension between population and geography**. States with larger absolute rural populations receive more total dollars but less per resident. States with sparse populations scattered across vast distances receive more per capita but must cover enormous geography with limited absolute funding. Oregon sits uncomfortably in the middle: enough rural residents to dilute per-capita funding, enough territory to make service delivery expensive.

**Medicaid Expansion Status:** Oregon expanded Medicaid under the ACA. The Oregon Health Plan (OHP) covers approximately 1.4 million Oregonians statewide. Rural residents rely heavily on Medicaid, with **26%+ of rural residents enrolled**.

**Medicaid Cut Exposure:** Oregon faces **estimated cuts of $600+ million in Medicaid funding over 10 years** under H.R. 1 provisions. These cuts will disproportionately affect rural providers already operating at negative margins. The RHTP award of $197.3 million annually, while significant, covers only a portion of projected Medicaid losses.

## State Approach

### Governance Structure

**Oregon Health Authority (OHA)** serves as the lead agency with a governance model that leverages existing infrastructure:

**Oregon Office of Rural Health (ORH)** at OHSU provides technical assistance, data analysis, and coordination support. The Office has decades of experience supporting rural facilities and brings established relationships with rural hospitals and clinics.

**Coordinated Care Organizations (CCOs)** serve as regional implementation partners. Oregon's 16 CCOs already manage Medicaid beneficiaries under capitated contracts and have experience with value-based payment, population health, and regional coordination.

**Tribal Nations** receive explicit inclusion in the governance framework, with consultation requirements and dedicated funding considerations for the state's nine federally recognized tribes.

### Strategic Framework

Oregon's application organizes transformation around **four state-led initiatives**:

| Initiative | Focus Area | Estimated Allocation |
|------------|------------|---------------------|
| Access Points and Services | Facility support, EMS, specialists | ~35% |
| Workforce Development | Recruitment, training, retention | ~30% |
| Technology and Innovation | Telehealth, data systems, AI tools | ~20% |
| Prevention and Chronic Disease | Population health, CCO alignment | ~15% |

The distribution signals Oregon's recognition that **workforce and access points represent the binding constraints**. Technology investments without clinicians to use them deliver limited value. Prevention programs require providers to implement them.

### Phased Deployment

Oregon's application structures implementation in two major phases:

**Phase 1 (2026-2027): Catalyst Awards**
- Rapid deployment to projects ready for immediate implementation
- Planning grants for regional partnerships requiring development time
- Focus on initiatives with existing infrastructure

**Phase 2 (2028-2030): Sustainable Systems**
- Larger collaborative projects demonstrating long-term viability
- Regional network development
- Shared infrastructure investments

OHA designated certain projects for **Immediate Impact Awards** that bypass competitive application, targeting projects directly supporting one-year CMS metrics.

## Program and Funding Distribution

| Program | Allocation (Est.) | Implementing Organization | Focus |
|---------|-------------------|--------------------------|-------|
| Rural Facility Sustainability | $50 million | OHA/Hospital Association | Direct payments tied to quality metrics and financial improvement |
| Workforce Recruitment/Retention | $35 million | ORH/OHSU | Loan repayment, preceptor development, retention incentives |
| EMS Enhancement | $20 million | Regional Partnerships | Equipment, training, coordination |
| Telehealth Infrastructure | $25 million | OHA/CCOs | Broadband support, equipment, platform standardization |
| Specialty Access Expansion | $15 million | OHSU/Regional Systems | Visiting specialists, telehealth connections |
| CCO Prevention Programs | $18 million | 16 CCOs | Population health, chronic disease management |
| Community Health Worker Expansion | $12 million | CCOs/CBOs | Rural CHW deployment, training |
| SDOH Screening and Referral | $10 million | CCOs/Community Partners | Screening systems, referral coordination |
| Mobile Health Deployment | $7 million | Regional Providers | Communities lacking fixed facilities |
| Administrative/Oversight | $5 million | OHA | CMS reporting, performance monitoring |

**Note:** Allocations estimated from application priorities. CCO-administered programs represent significant funding stream.

## Social Care Integration

Oregon's application includes **explicit social determinants components** integrated within the Prevention and Chronic Disease initiative. The state's CCO infrastructure provides established channels for SDOH work.

| Component | Included in Plan | Funding (Est.) | Vendor/Operator | Likely Funded? |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| SDOH/HRSN Screening | Yes | ~$10 million | CCOs | Yes |
| HRSN Navigation | Yes | ~$8 million | CCOs/CBOs | At Risk |
| CHW Deployment | Yes | ~$12 million | CCOs/Regional Partners | Yes |
| CIE Platform | Yes | Existing infrastructure | Unite Us (Connect Oregon) | Yes |

### SDOH Screening and Navigation

Oregon's **16 Coordinated Care Organizations** already implement SDOH screening and referral under existing OHA contracts. RHTP investments enhance these capabilities for rural populations with limited CCO penetration.

The state's approach embeds SDOH within CCO-administered programs rather than creating parallel infrastructure. This model leverages existing relationships but creates implementation gaps in areas where CCO presence is weak.

### Community Health Worker Programs

**CHW deployment receives dedicated funding** through the Prevention and Chronic Disease initiative. Oregon's approach focuses on:
- Rural CHW expansion through CCO partnerships
- Training pipeline development via community colleges
- Supervision integration within primary care practices
- Cultural competency for tribal and agricultural worker populations

The state's existing CHW certification program provides regulatory framework. WWAMI (Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana, Idaho) participation through OHSU connects CHW training to broader regional workforce development.

**CHW employer model:** CCOs and FQHCs serve as primary employers with clinical supervision. No dedicated CHW intermediary proposed.

### Technology Platform Status

Oregon has **existing statewide CIE infrastructure through Connect Oregon**, a coordinated care network powered by Unite Us. RHTP does not require major new platform procurement because most CCOs already participate in Connect Oregon.

**Connect Oregon (Unite Us):** The majority of Oregon's 16 CCOs use Unite Us through Connect Oregon for closed-loop referrals and HRSN service coordination. Participating CCOs include Samaritan Health Services/IHN-CCO, PacificSource, CareOregon, Columbia Pacific CCO, Jackson Care Connect, Health Share of Oregon, AllCare Health, EOCCO, Yamhill Community Care, Advanced Health, Umpqua Health Alliance, and Trillium. The network has processed nearly **$4 million in HRSN services** through the platform as of mid-2025.

**Findhelp:** A small number of CCOs use Findhelp as an alternative platform. OHA maintains Statewide Price Agreements with both Unite Us and Findhelp to accommodate CCO preferences.

**211info:** Serves as the coordination center for Connect Oregon, providing resource directory maintenance and community engagement support.

**RHTP technology focus:** Funds prioritize EHR optimization and health information exchange expansion rather than CIE platform procurement, given existing infrastructure.

## Key Subawardees

| Organization | Type | Contract Value (Est.) | Role in RHTP Implementation |
|--------------|------|----------------------|----------------------------|
| Oregon Office of Rural Health (OHSU) | Academic/TA | $15 million | Technical assistance, data analysis, stakeholder convening |
| Oregon Primary Care Association | Intermediary | $12 million | FQHC coordination, workforce pipeline |
| Oregon Association of Hospitals | Intermediary | $10 million | Hospital network coordination, quality improvement |
| Coordinated Care Organizations (16) | Regional Partners | $60 million | Population health, VBP implementation, SDOH |
| OHSU Health System | Academic Partner | $25 million | Telehealth hub, residency expansion, specialist access |
| Regional Health Systems | Provider Networks | $30 million | Providence, Legacy, Samaritan rural affiliates |
| Area Health Education Centers | Workforce | $8 million | Training pipeline development |
| Community-Based Organizations | Community Partners | $15 million | CHW deployment, SDOH navigation |
| Tribal Health Programs | Tribal Partners | $10 million | Culturally appropriate care delivery |

### CCO-Centered Implementation

Oregon's 16 CCOs represent the primary implementation channel for population health and social care investments. CCOs have:
- Decade of experience with capitated Medicaid contracts
- Established value-based payment infrastructure
- Regional coordination experience
- Existing SDOH screening requirements

**CCO variation:** Implementation capacity varies significantly across CCOs. Urban-adjacent CCOs have more resources than frontier-serving organizations. RHTP must address capacity gaps in weakest CCOs.

### Academic Partnership

**OHSU** provides multiple implementation functions:
- Oregon Office of Rural Health technical assistance
- Telehealth hub for specialty access
- Rural residency track expansion
- Research and evaluation capacity

OHSU's rural affiliate relationships connect smaller facilities to academic resources while maintaining local operational control.

## Assessment

### Strengths

**CCO Infrastructure:** Oregon's decade of investment in Coordinated Care Organizations provides implementation capacity that most states lack. The 16 CCOs have experience with population health, value-based payment, and regional coordination. RHTP investments can leverage this infrastructure rather than building new systems.

**OHSU Partnership:** The Oregon Office of Rural Health brings established relationships with rural facilities, technical expertise in rural healthcare delivery, and research capacity to evaluate interventions. This academic-state partnership provides continuity regardless of political changes.

**Phased Deployment:** The two-phase structure acknowledges that communities start from different positions. Catalyst Awards get resources to ready projects quickly while planning grants develop capacity for larger investments.

**Value-Based Foundation:** With 80% of state health spending tied to quality expectations, Oregon providers have experience with performance accountability. RHTP's quality metrics align with existing CCO reporting requirements.

**Social Care Integration:** Oregon's explicit CHW funding and CCO-administered SDOH programs represent stronger social care commitment than many state applications.

**Connect Oregon CIE Infrastructure:** Most CCOs already participate in Connect Oregon, a statewide Unite Us network for closed-loop referrals. This existing infrastructure eliminates the CIE procurement challenge that other states face, allowing RHTP to focus on service delivery rather than platform buildout.

### Vulnerabilities

**Per-Capita Limitations:** At ~$131 per rural resident, Oregon's funding falls short of what comprehensive transformation requires. The money must stretch across workforce, infrastructure, technology, and population health initiatives simultaneously.

**Geographic Dispersion:** Frontier counties with six or fewer people per square mile present challenges that money cannot solve. Travel times, recruitment barriers, and service delivery costs in these areas exceed what traditional healthcare models accommodate.

**Hospital Financial Position:** With one-third of rural hospitals at negative margins and $93 million in combined losses, the baseline requires stabilization before transformation. RHTP funds may flow to financial rescue rather than system redesign.

**Workforce Pipeline Duration:** Training new physicians takes a decade. RHTP's five-year timeline cannot produce enough new providers to address current shortages. Retention and recruitment of existing providers becomes essential but uncertain.

**Rural CCO Capacity Variation:** Implementation capacity varies significantly across CCOs. Urban-adjacent CCOs have more resources than frontier-serving organizations. RHTP must address capacity gaps in weakest CCOs to achieve statewide impact.

### Social Care Survival Prospects

**SDOH Screening:** Survives through existing CCO requirements and additional RHTP investment. Screening infrastructure likely to persist.

**HRSN Navigation:** At risk. CCO-administered navigation competes with core medical services for attention and resources. Rural CCOs may deprioritize navigation under financial pressure.

**CHW Deployment:** Likely survives. Dedicated funding stream and CCO employer model provide stability. Training pipeline remains vulnerable to budget triage.

**CIE Platform:** Operational. Connect Oregon provides statewide closed-loop referral infrastructure through Unite Us. Most CCOs already participate. Platform has processed nearly $4 million in HRSN services as of mid-2025.

### The 2030 Question

Oregon's sustainability strategy emphasizes:

**CCO Integration:** Embedding RHTP-funded programs within CCO operations creates ongoing financial support through capitation rather than grant dependency.

**Value-Based Payment Expansion:** Shifting more provider revenue to VBP arrangements reduces reliance on volume and creates incentives for efficiency and prevention.

**State Policy Commitments:** Oregon's application includes policy commitments around workforce scope of practice, telehealth coverage, and rural facility support that extend beyond RHTP funding.

**The deeper question:** Whether transformation proceeds fast enough. Oregon's rural health system requires simultaneous investment in workforce, facilities, technology, and population health. Five years of historic investment can improve trajectories without fundamentally altering the economic reality of healthcare delivery in frontier America.

## Conclusion

Oregon's $197.3 million RHTP award provides meaningful investment in a rural health system under significant stress. The state brings genuine advantages: a decade of CCO experience, established academic partnerships, and existing infrastructure for value-based care. The phased implementation approach reflects realistic assessment of community readiness.

The structural challenges remain formidable. One-third of rural hospitals operate at negative margins. Frontier counties face workforce and geography barriers that money alone cannot solve. Medicaid cuts will erode provider revenue while RHTP attempts to build new capacity.

Social care integration receives stronger commitment than many states, with dedicated CHW funding, CCO-administered SDOH programs, and existing CIE infrastructure through Connect Oregon. The Unite Us platform already processes HRSN referrals for most CCOs, providing closed-loop capability that many states lack.

For Oregon's 1.5 million rural residents, RHTP represents opportunity and uncertainty in equal measure. The state has a plan. The CCO infrastructure exists. **Whether rural Oregonians experience better healthcare depends on variables that extend beyond state borders and federal program timelines.**
