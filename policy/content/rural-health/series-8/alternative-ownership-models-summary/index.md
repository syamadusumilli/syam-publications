The Rural Health Transformation Program faces persistent advocacy for alternative ownership models as structural solutions to rural healthcare collapse. Healthcare cooperatives, worker-owned agencies, and community land trusts promise to align ownership with community benefit through a simple mechanism: who owns determines who decides, and who decides determines whether communities thrive or decline. The theory compels because external owners extract value while community owners reinvest it, external owners make portfolio decisions from distant headquarters while community owners reflect local priorities. The challenge is that promise exceeds proven capacity by substantial margins.

Alternative ownership remains marginal in American healthcare despite decades of advocacy. The most successful examples required generations to build. Recent attempts to create healthcare cooperatives collapsed spectacularly: **20 of 23 ACA Consumer Operated and Oriented Plans failed within three years** of a $2.4 billion federal investment. Worker-owned healthcare cooperatives exist and demonstrate compelling outcomes, but they number perhaps 20 to 30 organizations nationally, concentrate in home care services, and resist replication despite sustained efforts. Community land trusts for health facilities barely exist at all, with fewer than 10 nationally and most still in planning rather than operation.

The evidence landscape contains both genuine success and catastrophic failure. HealthPartners in Minnesota operates as the largest consumer-governed nonprofit health organization in the United States, serving 1.8 million members through integrated insurance and care delivery. Founded in 1957 after two decades of advocacy to change state law prohibiting cooperative medicine, HealthPartners grew through strategic mergers to own hospitals, employ physicians, and operate one of the nation's largest health research foundations. The organization demonstrates that **cooperative healthcare can achieve scale and quality**, earning CMS Health Equity Awards and recognition as a top 15 health system. Member governance influences strategy, and surpluses reinvest in services rather than flowing to shareholders.

Group Health Cooperative of Washington State served over 600,000 members from 1947 until Kaiser Permanente acquired it in 2017. For seven decades, Group Health operated as a consumer-governed integrated delivery system where members owned the plan, elected the board, and received care through Group Health facilities. The organization pioneered patient-centered medical homes and achieved outcomes outperforming regional competitors. The acquisition raises essential questions about cooperative sustainability. The board approved the sale citing benefits for members, but critics argued the sale represented failure after 70 years of independent operation. Supporters countered that members received value through the transition. **The acquisition illustrates cooperative governance working as designed while raising questions about long-term viability.**

Group Health Cooperative of South Central Wisconsin continues operating independently, serving over 80,000 members in the Madison area as a member-owned HMO with its own clinics. These success stories prove cooperative healthcare can work, but HealthPartners took 60 years to reach current size through careful expansion during a period when healthcare markets were less concentrated and competitive. Creating new healthcare cooperatives in the current environment faces dramatically different conditions.

The ACA CO-OP program represented the largest federal investment in cooperative healthcare development ever attempted. Congress provided $2.4 billion in federal loans to establish 23 new nonprofit, consumer-governed health insurance cooperatives beginning in 2014 as an alternative to the public option that progressive Democrats had sought. Twenty of 23 CO-OPs failed within four years. By 2020, only three remained: Community Health Options in Maine, Mountain Health CO-OP in Montana, and Common Ground Healthcare Cooperative in Wisconsin. The collapse affected over 700,000 enrollees who lost coverage and required new plans.

The failure had multiple reinforcing causes. CO-OPs received loans rather than grants and faced prohibition on spending loan funds for marketing, creating structural disadvantage against established carriers with decades of reserves and market presence. **Risk corridor payment failure proved catastrophic**, with the ACA's provisions to stabilize new insurers through fund transfers from profitable to struggling plans delivering only 12.6% of requested amounts in 2014-2016 after political opposition imposed budget neutrality requirements. CO-OPs that priced premiums assuming risk corridor support faced losses they could not absorb. Management inexperience compounded financial vulnerability, as ACA provisions prohibited anyone affiliated with existing insurers from serving on CO-OP boards. This excluded people with actual experience running health insurance companies, leaving CO-OPs led by mission-driven founders who often lacked operational expertise. Adverse selection accelerated death spirals, with CO-OPs pricing aggressively to gain market share attracting higher-risk enrollees, creating losses requiring premium increases that drove away healthier members.

The three surviving CO-OPs share characteristics: conservative pricing, geographic focus, strong management, and good fortune. Community Health Options in Maine had early profitability providing cushion for later losses. Common Ground received a $30 million lifeline loan from an anonymous source in 2016. Mountain Health operates in low-population states with limited competition. **The CO-OP experience demonstrates that cooperative governance does not guarantee success**, with consumer ownership failing to prevent catastrophic collapse and democratic governance producing no better decisions than commercial insurer governance. The structural advantages cooperatives supposedly offer did not materialize at scale under real-world conditions.

Worker-owned healthcare offers different evidence. Cooperative Home Care Associates in the Bronx stands as the largest worker-owned cooperative in the United States with over 2,000 employees, nearly all Latina and African American women. Founded in 1985 with 12 home health aides, CHCA provides home care services while demonstrating that worker ownership can transform healthcare's lowest-wage sectors. Employees purchase ownership stakes for $1,000 through modest weekly payroll deductions of $3.65. Worker-owners receive annual dividends based on profitability, vote in elections for 8 of 13 board seats, and participate in governance. **The ownership model produces measurable outcomes**: wages above market rates for home health aides, guaranteed 30-hour minimums for aides with three years of service, retention significantly exceeding the industry's chronic 60% annual turnover, training programs providing 150 hours of instruction double the 75-hour regulatory requirement, and B Corp certification with an impact score of 128.2 far exceeding the median business score of 50.9.

CHCA's success inspired replication efforts across Wisconsin, Washington, California, and elsewhere. Results remain mixed, with most worker cooperatives staying small and none approaching CHCA's scale. Replication challenges include startup capital that worker-owners typically cannot contribute substantially despite CHCA's benefit from foundation support and nonprofit partnerships during early growth, management expertise requiring skilled leadership that can work within democratic structures developed over decades, market context with CHCA operating in New York City's large Medicaid-funded home care demand absent in rural areas, and regulatory navigation through state-specific requirements not designed with cooperatives in mind. **The ICA Group's decades of supporting healthcare worker cooperative formation shows that success requires sustained technical assistance, patient capital, and realistic timelines.** A rural community attempting to create a worker-owned cooperative for home care faces a 5 to 10 year development process assuming everything goes well. RHTP's five-year funding window does not match cooperative development timelines.

Community land trusts represent largely unexplored territory for healthcare. The structure separating land ownership from facility operation has transformed affordable housing in hundreds of communities through the trust owning property permanently while users lease long-term. A healthcare community land trust would own land beneath facilities while hospitals, clinics, or nursing homes lease from the trust, theoretically preventing facility closure through sale, retaining community control through governance including community representation, and capturing land value appreciation within the community. Healthcare complexity creates obstacles that housing CLTs avoid, requiring licensure, credentialing, regulatory compliance, and operational expertise with land trusts needing qualified operators willing to work within their structures. **Capital requirements for acquiring healthcare facility land involve millions rather than the individual parcels housing CLTs typically acquire**, while timing mismatches emerge because healthcare facility land becomes available during closures or system divestments under time pressure that CLT acquisition processes cannot meet. Limited precedent means essentially no models for healthcare CLTs to follow, requiring each attempt to reinvent basic structures. Scattered attempts exist with community health centers exploring CLT structures and at least one dental clinic operating on community land trust property, but none has produced a mature, replicable model.

A case from Mineral County illustrates alternative ownership's core limitation. Population 3,100, the county lost its only hospital in 2019 when the 25-bed critical access hospital's regional health system owner determined it was no longer financially viable and offered the facility to the county lacking resources to operate it. Community leaders proposed a cooperative model with residents purchasing shares, electing a board, and hiring management to reopen the facility. Over 200 residents attended the initial meeting with widespread enthusiasm. Reality proved more difficult, with the cooperative needing $3 million in member shares against median household income of $38,000. Even at $500 per share, reaching $3 million required 6,000 shares from a population of 3,100. Regulatory requirements for reopening compounded financial challenges, requiring state hospital licensure, CMS certification, physician credentialing, and compliance infrastructure with consultants
