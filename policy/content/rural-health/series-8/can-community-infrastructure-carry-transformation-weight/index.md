RHTP applications promise community engagement. State plans describe partnerships with community-based organizations. Transformation rhetoric assumes community infrastructure exists, has capacity, and can partner with healthcare systems to achieve program goals. **Series 8 tested these assumptions against organizational reality.** The findings are uncomfortable for transformation advocates.

Community organizations do exist in rural America. Churches gather congregations. Food pantries distribute groceries. Civic clubs hold monthly meetings. CHWs knock on doors. These organizations possess something healthcare systems desperately need: **authentic community relationships** built over years of presence, service, and trust. A promotora who helps her neighbor manage diabetes carries credibility that a diabetes educator with superior clinical knowledge cannot match. A church that has run a food pantry for twenty years knows who needs help in ways that social service intake forms never capture.

The problem is that **community connection and institutional capacity rarely coexist**. The organizations most embedded in their communities are typically the least capable of meeting federal program requirements. The typical rural church has 40 to 60 attenders and a $50,000 to $75,000 annual budget. It cannot hire a program coordinator, implement reporting systems, or absorb the administrative burden of formal healthcare partnerships. The typical rural social service nonprofit operates with volunteer leadership, no paid staff, and no capacity for the documentation that federal compliance requires. **The attributes that make organizations valuable for authentic community voice often coexist with attributes that make them incapable of federal program partnership.**

This synthesis integrates findings from ten articles examining distinct community organization types, plus a technical document providing capacity assessment methodology. The evidence points to a conditional answer: **community organizations can support transformation sometimes, in some places, with significant support, and only for appropriate functions**. The unconditional assumption that community infrastructure exists and has capacity fails in too many contexts to guide implementation.

## The Capacity Question

### What Series 8 Found

Each article examined a different organization type through the lens of core tensions defining their transformation participation. The cross-article synthesis reveals patterns that transcend individual organization types.

| Organization Type | Core Tension | Capacity Assessment | Conditions for Partnership |
|-------------------|--------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Faith-Based (8A)** | Authenticity vs. Requirements | 115K-125K rural congregations; 83% report social service involvement; typical budget $50-75K | Institutional partners provide infrastructure; roles match capacity; professionalization respects community context |
| **Social Service Nonprofits (8B)** | Volunteer vs. Professional | 1.5M organizations nationally; 59% under $50K budget; capacity varies from professional to struggling | Capacity building precedes partnership; roles match actual capacity; technical assistance bridges gaps |
| **Civic Organizations (8C)** | Small Scale vs. Program Scale | Documented decline: Iowa fraternal membership down 67% (1994-2024); 87% of fire departments volunteer | Connection and convening roles only; avoid fiscal sponsorship or program management |
| **CHWs/Promotoras (8D)** | Community Voice vs. Clinical Absorption | 50%+ states have Medicaid CHW coverage; community identity enables effectiveness | Community-based employment; training adds without replacing community knowledge; clinical integration without absorption |
| **Community Development (8E)** | Mission Sustainability vs. Grant Dependency | 1,427 CDFIs nationally; 68 Native CDFIs; variable rural presence | Mission alignment exists; funding builds lasting capacity; sustainability planning from inception |
| **Advocacy/Mutual Aid (8F)** | Independence vs. Integration | Essential for accountability; capture destroys value | Structural independence protections; right to criticize partners; diversified relationships |
| **Alternative Ownership (8G)** | Promise vs. Proven Capacity | ACA CO-OPs: 20 of 23 failed; HealthPartners required 60+ years | Existing successful models only; realistic timelines; adequate capitalization and management |
| **Tribal Organizations (8H)** | Sovereignty vs. Federal Requirements | 574 federally recognized tribes; 92% have self-determination contracts; Nuka System demonstrates excellence | Government-to-government relationships; self-determination frameworks; tribal priorities shape participation |
| **Immigrant/Farmworker (8I)** | Serving the Invisible | 2.4M farmworkers; ~50% undocumented; 177 Migrant Health Centers serve ~1M | State policy permits serving populations; explicit inclusion provisions; protection from political targeting |
| **Schools/Youth (8J)** | Future Investment vs. Current Crisis | 3,900 SBHCs nationally; 35% rural; 9,000 rural school districts | Sustainable SBHC sponsors; current service delivery emphasis; accelerated workforce pathways |

### The Uncomfortable Finding

The synthesis across ten organization types reveals a pattern RHTP implementation must confront: **most rural community organizations possess strong community connection but weak professional capacity**. This is not organizational failure; it is structural reality. Volunteer-led organizations exist at volunteer scale. Faith-based organizations operate on faith community resources. Civic clubs function through civic volunteerism. These are features, not bugs, of authentic community organization.

The uncomfortable implication is that **RHTP's community partnership assumptions are systematically wrong**. The program expects community organizations to absorb subawards, implement reporting requirements, document outcomes, and sustain professional compliance infrastructure. Organizations capable of this represent the minority, not the majority, of rural community infrastructure. States that promise community-engaged transformation often cannot deliver because the community organizations they assume exist either do not exist or lack the capacity the promises require.

## What Evidence Shows

### Organizations That CAN Partner Effectively

Not all community organization capacity is absent. Series 8 identifies organization types and specific conditions that enable effective transformation partnership:

**Migrant Health Centers** serve 1 million farmworkers through 177 FQHC grantees with established infrastructure, billing systems, and federal compliance experience. They can absorb RHTP partnership because they already operate as federally-funded healthcare delivery organizations.

**Area Agencies on Aging** coordinate services for older adults under Older Americans Act mandates. The 622 AAAs nationally have professional staff, established service networks, and federal program experience that positions them for transformation roles, though 84% report workforce challenges affecting capacity.

**Community Action Agencies** trace lineage to the War on Poverty with tripartite governance and experience managing federal funds. The 1,100+ CAAs operating in 99% of U.S. counties represent established infrastructure with community development and social service capacity, though they too face workforce constraints.

**Tribal self-governance compacts** demonstrate that **tribal nations operating their own health programs can achieve results IHS direct provision cannot match**. The Nuka System of Care in Alaska, governed by Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium, shows what tribal self-determination can accomplish. Among the 526 tribes with self-determination contracts administering over 60% of the IHS budget, models of excellence exist that RHTP should support rather than constrain.

**Established CHW programs with state certification and Medicaid reimbursement** have developed infrastructure enabling sustainable operation. States like Texas (160-hour certification since 2001), California, and Oklahoma have built CHW programs that can partner with healthcare systems while maintaining community identity through careful program design.

**Professionalized social service nonprofits** with paid executive directors, staff, audited financials, and federal grant experience exist in some communities and can serve as effective partners. This represents perhaps 15% of rural social service nonprofits, the exception rather than the rule, but where they exist, they provide partnership capacity.

### Organizations That CANNOT Partner Effectively

The larger category is organizations that cannot meet transformation partnership requirements despite community value:

**Small volunteer-led organizations** constitute the majority of rural community infrastructure. Church pantries, Lions clubs, volunteer fire departments, and informal mutual aid networks provide genuine community benefit through volunteer commitment. They cannot absorb federal subawards, implement compliance systems, or sustain professional documentation. **Expecting professional capacity from volunteer organizations guarantees failure.**

**Organizations in leadership transition or financial crisis** lack stability for partnership regardless of prior capacity. Pastoral transitions at churches, executive director departures at nonprofits, and funding crises at CDFIs all create vulnerability that RHTP partnership would exacerbate rather than address.

**Organizations where professionalization destroys value** cannot be professionalized without losing what makes them effective. Promotoras embedded in community networks derive credibility from being neighbors first. Formalizing them into clinical employees may destroy the trust relationships that enabled their effectiveness. Mutual aid networks operate through horizontal peer relationships that professional staffing disrupts.

**Alternative ownership models without decades of development** cannot be created within RHTP timelines. The ACA CO-OP experience demonstrated this painfully: $2.4 billion in federal investment produced 23 cooperatives, 20 of which failed within three years. HealthPartners succeeded but required 60+ years of development. **Enthusiasm for cooperative healthcare is not substitute for the capital, management expertise, and time that success requires.**

**Urban Indian Organizations** operate at the margins of tribal health infrastructure. The 70% of American Indians and Alaska Natives living in urban areas are served by UIOs receiving approximately 1% of IHS budget. These organizations provide essential services but face chronic underfunding that RHTP partnership cannot address. **25% of UIOs report they would need layoffs if funding were interrupted for just 90 days.**

### Geographic Variation in Capacity

Community organization capacity is not randomly distributed. Series 8 reveals systematic geographic patterns that RHTP implementation must acknowledge:

**Strong infrastructure concentrates in historically stable regions.** The Upper Midwest, New England, and other areas with long-standing civic traditions maintain community organization networks that persist through generational transmission. These communities have Rotary clubs, active churches, community foundations, and civic capacity that enables partnership. Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Iowa retain civic organization membership rates that other regions lost decades ago. Vermont and Maine maintain community health infrastructure through networks of small organizations that function collectively.

**Depleted infrastructure characterizes stressed regions.** The Mississippi Delta, Appalachian coalfields, Great Plains agricultural counties, and other areas experiencing decades of outmigration and economic decline have lost community organizational capacity alongside population and economic base. **RHTP cannot partner with organizations that demographic and economic change have eliminated.** In these regions, the volunteer base has aged out, churches have closed, civic clubs have dissolved, and the organizational infrastructure that once supported community life no longer exists. Transformation planning that assumes community organizations will partner with healthcare systems confronts absence rather than capacity.

**Philanthropic investment shapes capacity.** Rural communities receive approximately 3% of philanthropic dollars despite comprising 15-20% of the population. Where foundations have invested in community development infrastructure, capacity exists. The Appalachian Regional Commission, Duke Endowment in the Carolinas, and Kellogg Foundation investments in the Delta have built organizational capacity that would not exist otherwise. Where philanthropic investment has bypassed rural areas, capacity gaps persist that RHTP cannot address within program timelines.

**State policy environments matter.** States with CDFI tax credits, CHW certification programs, and community development investment have built infrastructure that enables partnership. Texas established CHW certification in 2001 and now has the most developed CHW infrastructure in the country. North Carolina has invested in community health through its Office of Rural Health for decades. States without such investment have infrastructure gaps that RHTP cannot fill within program timelines.

**Tribal infrastructure follows different patterns.** The 574 federally recognized tribes have their own organizational infrastructure shaped by sovereignty, self-determination policy, and IHS relationships rather than the civic traditions that shape non-tribal community capacity. Strong tribal health infrastructure exists in Alaska, the Southwest, and the Northern Plains where tribal governments have exercised self-determination effectively. Urban Indian populations lack comparable infrastructure despite comprising 70% of the American Indian and Alaska Native population.

## The Core Tensions Revisited

### Tension 1: Authenticity vs. Institutional Requirements

Faith-based organizations, CHWs, and mutual aid networks derive effectiveness from community authenticity. Federal program requirements demand institutional formality. **The tension is often unresolvable.** A church that meets nondiscrimination certification, secular service delivery documentation, and quarterly reporting requirements is no longer operating as a church. A promotora following clinical protocols in an electronic health record is no longer functioning as a community member helping neighbors.

The partial resolution is **intermediary structures** that provide institutional capacity while preserving community relationships. The Wesley Nurse model works because Methodist Healthcare Ministries employs the nurses, provides supervision, and maintains compliance systems while churches provide community presence. Individual congregations do not become federal grantees; they partner with organizations that can handle what they cannot.

### Tension 2: Community Voice vs. Implementation Capacity

RHTP needs both community voice and implementation capacity. **These are different functions that different organizations provide.** Advocacy organizations authentically represent community perspectives but may lack capacity for program implementation. Healthcare systems have implementation capacity but lack authentic community voice. Expecting single organizations to provide both sets communities up for capture (voice organizations absorbed into implementation) or failure (implementation organizations lacking community legitimacy).

The resolution is **differentiated engagement**. Value advocacy organizations for voice, even when they lack implementation capacity. Value healthcare systems for implementation, even when they lack community legitimacy. Build partnerships where voice organizations inform and monitor implementation organizations rather than expecting organizations to transcend their core competencies.

### Tension 3: Federal Requirements vs. Organizational Reality

Federal programs have requirements: reporting, accountability, performance metrics, standardized implementation. Rural community organizations often cannot meet these requirements without transformation that destroys their character. **The requirements are not unreasonable for federal programs. The organizations are not deficient for being what they are.** The mismatch is structural.

Partial resolutions include **tiered requirements** that match documentation expectations to organizational capacity, **fiscal sponsorship** arrangements where capable organizations manage compliance on behalf of community partners, and **technical assistance** that builds capacity over time. Complete resolution is not possible: some requirements exist for accountability reasons that cannot be waived, and some organizations will never develop capacity regardless of support.

### Tension 4: Scale Mismatch

Community organizations operate at community scale. RHTP operates at state and national scale. **Small organizations cannot absorb large programs.** A church with 50 members and $60,000 annual budget cannot manage a $200,000 subaward without fundamental transformation. A community foundation with $2 million in assets and a part-time director cannot serve as fiscal sponsor for multi-million-dollar county initiatives.

The resolution requires **matching program scale to organizational capacity**. This means smaller subawards to more organizations, regional intermediaries that aggregate small organization contributions, or accepting that some communities lack organizational capacity for RHTP-scale partnership.

### Tension 5: Sustainability Beyond 2030

RHTP runs through 2030. Community organization capacity built through RHTP may not survive funding withdrawal. **Organizations built around temporary funding frequently collapse when funding ends.** The grant dependency pattern that has characterized federal community investment for decades will likely repeat.

The partial resolution is **building sustainability from inception**. Organizations that integrate RHTP activities into existing mission, develop replacement funding strategies, and build stakeholder support for continuation fare better than those that address sustainability only when funding end approaches. Complete resolution is not possible: some programs will end, and some organizations will close when RHTP funding disappears.

### Tension 6: Independence vs. Integration

Advocacy organizations and mutual aid networks derive value from independence. They can criticize healthcare systems because they do not depend on them. RHTP partnership creates dependency that may compromise independence. **Captured advocacy organizations become legitimizers of systems they once challenged.**

The resolution requires **structural protections negotiated before partnership acceptance**. Organizations that secure explicit provisions protecting critical voice, including right to criticize partners, requirement for response to recommendations, and protection from funding retaliation, can maintain independence within partnership. Organizations that accept partnership without such protections face capture pressure they cannot resist.

## The Vignette That Captures It All

*A state RHTP coordinator visits a rural county to assess community organization capacity for transformation partnership. The assessment reveals the reality that planning documents obscured.*

**First stop: the Baptist church**, largest congregation in the county seat. The part-time pastor serves three churches across 40 miles. Average Sunday attendance is 35, down from 120 twenty years ago. The church runs a food pantry from a closet, distributing donated cans to perhaps 15 families monthly. The pastor works a day job; church business happens on evenings and weekends. "We'd love to help more," the pastor says, "but we can barely keep the lights on."

**Second stop: the community action agency**, theoretically the county's social service coordinator. The office is in the basement of the courthouse, staffed by one person who also serves two adjacent counties. She manages LIHEAP applications, some emergency assistance, and referrals to services that mostly don't exist locally. "Our budget got cut 40% five years ago. I do what I can."

**Third stop: the civic club**, Rotary chapter that has met for 60 years. Twelve members remain, average age 72. They raise $3,000 annually through a pancake breakfast, distributed as small scholarships and Christmas assistance. "We used to do a lot more. Young people don't join organizations anymore."

**Fourth stop: the health department**, actually located in the next county. A public health nurse visits twice monthly for immunizations and WIC certification. "We serve eight counties with four staff. I can give you two hours a week, maybe."

**The coordinator's report** acknowledges what the site visits revealed: this county lacks community organization capacity for RHTP partnership. No organization can absorb a subaward, implement reporting requirements, or sustain transformation programming. The county will receive healthcare-led implementation with community input rather than community-engaged transformation.

**Some committee members object.** "We promised community partnership in the application. We can't just abandon community engagement." But the coordinator asks: "Partnership with whom? The church that can barely pay utilities? The civic club of retirees? The county has lost the organizational infrastructure that community partnership requires. We can pretend capacity exists or we can acknowledge reality and design approaches that might actually work."

**The county is not unusual.** It represents perhaps a quarter of rural America: places where decades of decline have eliminated the community organizations that transformation planning assumes exist. RHTP cannot rebuild what took generations to create. It can strengthen what remains in communities that still have infrastructure. It should not pretend capacity is present when visits to the church basement and the Rotary lunch reveal otherwise.

## The Honest Assessment

Can community infrastructure carry transformation weight? **The honest answer is conditional: sometimes, in some places, with significant support, and only for certain functions.**

The unconditional assumption that community organizations exist and have capacity is **false in too many contexts to guide implementation**. RHTP cannot partner with organizations that do not exist. It cannot expect professional capacity from volunteer organizations. It cannot build cooperative healthcare infrastructure within five-year timelines. It cannot resolve the tension between authenticity and institutional requirements through program design alone.

### The Capacity Spectrum

Series 8 analysis suggests a capacity spectrum that states should use to match strategies to organizational reality:

**High capacity organizations** (perhaps 15-20% of rural community infrastructure) can absorb direct RHTP partnership. These include professionalized nonprofits, established CDFIs, Area Agencies on Aging, Community Action Agencies, Migrant Health Centers, and tribal health organizations operating under self-determination compacts. Direct subaward relationships, full reporting requirements, and implementation expectations are appropriate for these organizations.

**Moderate capacity organizations** (perhaps 25-30%) can participate with significant technical assistance. These include semi-professional nonprofits with part-time paid staff, established churches with administrative capacity, civic organizations with strong volunteer leadership, and CHW programs in early development. Partnership should include capacity building support, simplified reporting, and graduated expectations that increase as capacity develops.

**Emerging capacity organizations** (perhaps 20-25%) require capacity building before partnership. These include volunteer-led organizations with leadership willing to develop professional systems, new CDFIs or cooperatives in early stages, and community development organizations expanding into health. Investment in organizational development should precede program expectations. Results will arrive after RHTP concludes.

**Low capacity organizations and communities** (perhaps 25-30%) cannot support formal RHTP partnership regardless of program design. These include declining churches approaching closure, volunteer organizations without succession planning, communities where civic infrastructure has collapsed, and areas where no community organizations exist. Alternative approaches are necessary: healthcare-led implementation, intermediary organization engagement, or state direct service delivery.

### What RHTP Can and Cannot Do

What RHTP can do:

**Assess actual capacity rather than assuming it.** The TD-A Capacity Assessment Framework provides methodology for distinguishing organizations that can support transformation from those that cannot. States should conduct capacity assessment before programming, not discover capacity gaps during implementation.

**Differentiate approaches based on capacity.** Communities with strong organizational infrastructure can support community-engaged transformation with direct partnership. Communities with emerging capacity can support transformation with significant technical assistance. Communities lacking capacity require alternative approaches: healthcare-led implementation, intermediary organizations, or state direct engagement.

**Invest in capacity building where potential exists.** Some communities have organizations that could develop greater capacity with investment. Multi-year capacity building grants can strengthen community infrastructure, but results take years beyond RHTP timelines. Investment must be patient.

**Use alternative approaches where capacity is absent.** Not every community has organizational infrastructure to engage. In these contexts, expecting community partnership produces compliance theater rather than genuine engagement. Healthcare-led implementation with community input may be the only viable approach where community capacity does not exist.

**Accept realistic timelines.** Capacity building takes longer than RHTP provides. Alternative ownership models require decades, not years. Workforce pipeline investments produce returns after funding ends. RHTP should include long-term investments while accepting that transformation results will arrive after program conclusion.

**Protect authenticity within partnership.** Partnership design should preserve what makes community organizations valuable rather than transforming them into something less effective. Intermediary structures, community-based employment, and roles matched to capacity all help maintain authenticity while enabling partnership.

What RHTP cannot do:

**Create community infrastructure that does not exist.** Decades of demographic and economic change have eliminated community organizations in many rural areas. RHTP's five-year timeline cannot rebuild what took generations to create and generations to destroy.

**Make volunteer organizations into professional partners.** The character of volunteer-led organizations is incompatible with federal program requirements. Forcing professionalization destroys organizational identity without creating sustainable capacity.

**Resolve the authenticity-requirements tension through program design.** Some organizations derive effectiveness from informality that federal requirements would eliminate. No amount of program flexibility can make formal requirements compatible with informal operations.

**Substitute community partnership for community capacity.** Naming community organizations as partners does not create capacity they lack. Partnership agreements without underlying organizational capacity produce paper relationships without transformation impact.

## Recommendations

### For Community Organizations

**Assess capacity honestly before accepting partnership roles.** The desire to help does not create the capacity to help. Overcommitment harms both organizations and communities. Organizations should seek roles matched to actual capacity rather than aspirational capacity. A church that cannot manage quarterly reporting should not accept a subaward requiring it. A civic club that meets monthly cannot commit to continuous program delivery.

**Seek roles that match actual capacity.** Providing meeting space, community connection, and informal support are legitimate contributions. Not every partnership requires program implementation. Organizations provide value through community voice even without implementation capacity. Advisory committee participation, community outreach, and relationship facilitation all contribute to transformation without requiring federal compliance infrastructure.

**Build capacity over time if transformation participation is desired.** Capacity building takes years. Organizations wanting larger transformation roles should invest in systems, staff, and infrastructure now for future opportunities. The time to develop professional capacity is before RHTP subawards become available, not after.

**Protect organizational identity within partnerships.** Partnerships should strengthen, not replace, organizational mission. Churches that become social service agencies may lose what made them effective. CHWs absorbed into clinical culture may lose the community identity that enabled their impact. The organizations that preserve their core character while adding partnership capacity serve communities better than those that transform beyond recognition.

**Negotiate sustainability from the start.** Organizations accepting RHTP roles should plan for 2030 from inception. What happens when funding ends? Will the program continue? Will staff be retained? Will community expectations be met? Organizations that defer sustainability thinking until funding end approaches rarely achieve it.

### For State Agencies

**Conduct capacity assessment before assuming community partnership.** Map organizational infrastructure at county level. Identify which communities have capacity, which have emerging capacity, and which lack organizational infrastructure entirely. Design implementation strategies based on assessment, not assumption. The TD-A framework provides methodology; the discipline of using it matters more than the specific tool.

**Differentiate strategies based on actual capacity.** In communities with strong infrastructure, community-engaged transformation makes sense. In communities lacking capacity, use alternative approaches rather than pretending capacity exists. Three tiers of strategy may be appropriate:
- **Direct community partnership** where high-capacity organizations exist
- **Intermediary-supported partnership** where moderate-capacity organizations can develop with support  
- **Healthcare-led implementation with community input** where organizational capacity is absent

**Fund capacity building where potential exists.** Some communities have organizations that could develop greater capacity with investment. Multi-year grants with technical assistance can strengthen infrastructure, but expect results beyond RHTP timelines. Capacity building is a ten-year investment, not a five-year program.

**Use intermediary organizations where local capacity is absent.** Regional nonprofits, healthcare systems, or state agencies can implement transformation in communities lacking local capacity. This is not failure; it is realistic response to actual conditions. Intermediaries should be selected for their ability to maintain community relationships even without community organizational partners.

**Accept that some communities lack partnerable infrastructure.** Not every rural area has churches with capacity, functioning civic organizations, or community development infrastructure. RHTP cannot create what decades of demographic and economic change have eliminated. Program design should acknowledge these communities and provide for them rather than pretending they fit community partnership models.

### For Healthcare Partners

**Value community organizations for authentic voice, not program capacity.** Organizations may authentically represent community perspectives while lacking capacity for program implementation. Value organizations for what they can do. Do not demand implementation capacity from organizations whose value lies in community connection. A church that knows its community's struggles provides intelligence even if it cannot manage a subaward.

**Avoid overwhelming small organizations with partnership demands.** Requests for community partnership often translate into unfunded work that strains volunteer organizations. Be specific about what partnership entails and realistic about organizational capacity. "Can you help us understand community needs?" is a different request than "Can you manage this program component?"

**Build community capacity rather than extracting community legitimacy.** Some partnerships use community organization names for legitimacy while providing nothing in return. Genuine partnership builds organizational capacity rather than depleting it. If partnership makes organizations stronger, it serves transformation. If partnership weakens organizations, it undermines community infrastructure.

**Accept that CHWs are not clinical extenders.** The impulse to address provider shortage through CHW scope expansion misunderstands CHW effectiveness. CHWs add to care teams through community connection, not clinical substitution. Healthcare systems that absorb CHWs into clinical roles lose the community identity that made CHWs valuable. Protect what makes CHWs effective.

**Support community organization sustainability.** Healthcare partners with ongoing revenue streams can help community organizations survive RHTP funding end. Contracts that continue beyond 2030, capacity building investments, and infrastructure support all contribute to organizational sustainability that RHTP alone cannot achieve.

### For CMS

**Allow states flexibility to adapt to varying community capacity.** One-size-fits-all community engagement requirements ignore dramatic variation in organizational infrastructure. States need flexibility to match approaches to actual capacity. Requiring community partnership in communities lacking organizations produces compliance paperwork, not transformation.

**Do not require community partnership where capacity does not exist.** Mandating community organization participation in communities lacking infrastructure produces compliance theater rather than genuine engagement. States should demonstrate community engagement through whatever mechanisms their communities support, not through uniform partnership requirements that some communities cannot meet.

**Fund capacity building as transformation prerequisite.** Community organization capacity does not appear because programs need it. Investment in organizational development must precede expectations for partnership. Consider capacity building grants that run longer than program timelines, building infrastructure that serves future transformation efforts.

**Measure community engagement quality, not just quantity.** Counting subawards to community organizations tells nothing about whether partnership is genuine or effective. Quality metrics assessing authentic engagement matter more than quantity metrics counting partnerships. One genuine community partnership with demonstrated impact is worth more than ten paper partnerships with absent capacity.

## Transition to Series 9

Series 8 examined the organizations that might support transformation. Series 9 examines the populations transformation should serve: special populations with distinct needs including rural elderly, children, veterans, people with disabilities, and others whose transformation requirements differ from general rural populations. **The organizational capacity constraints identified in Series 8 shape what transformation can actually deliver for the populations Series 9 will examine.**

The connection between organizational capacity and population outcomes is direct. Rural elderly populations need aging-in-place services that depend on community organization delivery. If Area Agencies on Aging face workforce challenges affecting 84% of their membership, aging services capacity is constrained regardless of RHTP investment. Rural children need school-based health centers that depend on sustainable sponsoring organizations. If FQHC sponsors are unavailable in a community, SBHC expansion cannot occur. Rural veterans need coordinated care that depends on community organizations connecting VA services with local support. If community capacity is absent, coordination cannot happen.

Series 9 will examine each special population with explicit attention to the organizational capacity requirements for serving them. For each population, the analysis will assess:

- What community organization types typically serve this population
- Whether those organization types have capacity in regions where the population concentrates
- What happens when organizational capacity is absent
- Alternative approaches for serving populations where community infrastructure is depleted

The gap between population needs and organizational capacity is not a problem RHTP can solve through program design. It is a constraint that shapes what transformation can accomplish. Honest assessment of this constraint serves populations better than promises that assume capacity exists.

RHTP cannot build community infrastructure that decades of demographic and economic change have depleted. It can strengthen infrastructure that exists. It can support organizations with capacity while honestly acknowledging where capacity is absent. What it cannot do is pretend that community partnership is universally available when the evidence demonstrates it is not.
