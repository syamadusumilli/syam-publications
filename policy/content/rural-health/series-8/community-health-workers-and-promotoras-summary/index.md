The Rural Health Transformation Program deploys community health workers across nearly every state application, riding a decade-long expansion in which CHW Medicaid coverage has spread from 29 states in 2022 to more than half today. The 2024 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule introduced the first Medicare billing codes for CHW services, marking federal recognition of a role that operates at the boundary between healthcare systems and the communities they serve. This is not marginal programming. Yet the rapid expansion creates a fundamental tension that threatens to destroy precisely what makes CHWs effective: **their identity as community members rather than healthcare employees**.

Community health workers are trusted members of their communities who share ethnicity, language, socioeconomic status, and lived experience with the populations they serve. This shared identity enables trust that healthcare professionals, however skilled, cannot replicate. The Bureau of Labor Statistics defines CHWs as those who assist communities in adopting healthy behaviors and conduct outreach for health organizations, but this definition understates the relationship dynamics that distinguish CHWs from clinical staff. Promotoras, the CHW model within Latino communities, typically are women who operate through trust networks built on shared language, immigration experience, and cultural understanding. The common element across CHW roles is **community membership as qualification, not formal education**.

CHW functions span health education, care navigation, social needs screening, translation, and advocacy. They teach chronic disease self-management in community contexts, help navigate insurance paperwork, identify food insecurity and housing instability, and represent community perspectives within healthcare organizations. Studies consistently show CHW interventions improve outcomes for diabetes management, cancer screening, maternal health, and appropriate healthcare utilization. The mechanism of effectiveness is relationship and trust, not clinical expertise. CHWs succeed not despite lacking clinical training but because their different knowledge base enables different relationships.

Healthcare systems facing workforce shortages see CHWs as potential capacity extenders. If CHWs could perform clinical tasks, they would partially address provider shortages at lower cost. This framing drives pressure to expand CHW scope of practice toward clinical functions, manifested through task creep, documentation requirements designed for licensed providers, clinical supervision emphasis, and healthcare-based employment that absorbs CHWs into clinical culture. The alternative view holds that **CHW effectiveness depends on maintaining community identity distinct from clinical roles**. Evidence supports this: programs that over-medicalize CHWs often underperform, while those maintaining community identity show stronger outcomes. The promotora tradition illustrates this principle, as promotoras operate through existing community networks affiliated with churches and schools rather than healthcare facilities, helping neighbors because they are neighbors rather than because employment requires it.

State CHW certification programs have expanded dramatically, though requirements vary substantially. Texas established the first comprehensive certification in 2001 requiring 160 hours of training, and by 2024 most states operated some recognition program. Texas has certified over 8,666 CHWs serving 189 counties through 49 approved training programs, benefiting from established Medicaid reimbursement providing sustainability beyond grants. California has active Medi-Cal CHW reimbursement at $31.74 per 30 minutes but paused certification indefinitely in November 2023 following stakeholder concerns that proposed requirements were not fit for purpose. Oklahoma received CMS state plan amendment approval in 2024 without requiring state certification, demonstrating that Medicaid reimbursement pathways need not require formal certification programs.

Certification creates trade-offs relevant to the community voice versus expertise tension. Benefits include wage improvement (studies find CHW wages increase approximately $2.42 per hour in states with certification), professional recognition, quality assurance, and career pathways. Risks include professionalization pressure where training requirements emphasize clinical knowledge over community connection, barriers to entry excluding community members who cannot access training, institutional capture where healthcare systems design certification prioritizing clinical perspectives, and cultural mismatch where standardized curricula do not accommodate variation in CHW roles. **Rate adequacy varies significantly**. South Dakota raised rates to $64.86 per hour following employer feedback that initial rates were insufficient, while California's rate has been criticized as inadequate for community-based organization sustainability.

CHW employment models significantly affect community identity preservation. Healthcare provider employment integrates CHWs directly into clinical organizations, offering clinical integration and stable employment but risking cultural absorption into clinical perspective and priority shift toward clinical productivity. Community-based organization employment maintains community connection but faces sustainability challenges, as CBOs depend on grants and contracts that fluctuate annually, with turnover rates at CBO-employed CHW programs running as high as 50% annually, destroying relationship continuity. Managed care organization employment offers sustainable funding through capitation revenue but may prioritize high-cost member management over community health improvement. Health department employment provides stability but limited clinical integration. Tribal employment through Community Health Representative programs maintains cultural alignment and federal funding, though serving only tribal populations.

The Esperanza Community Health Program illustrates these tensions. Operating for 12 years through a community nonprofit with church partnerships, fifteen promotoras provided health education and care navigation to farmworker families in a Central Valley agricultural town, achieving strong outcomes that evaluations attributed to the fact that neighbors trusted neighbors in ways they did not trust the clinic. When the regional health system proposed absorption to provide benefits and job security in exchange for clinical protocol compliance and electronic health record documentation, the board debated intensely. The longtime program director, herself a former promotora, warned that promotoras were trusted because they represented community rather than clinic, and that clinical protocols would change how they spent time while documentation requirements would pull them from relationship into paperwork. They negotiated a hybrid arrangement where the health system contracted with the nonprofit rather than employing promotoras directly, enabling higher wages while preserving nonprofit employment, hiring authority, and community identity. Three years later, **outcomes remained strong precisely because the arrangement preserved what made promotoras effective**.

Nearly all RHTP state applications include CHW deployment, with variation in whether programs receive distinct funding, explicit targets, and protected allocations. Texas proposes the most ambitious deployment at 500 new CHWs plus 300 employed positions, building on two decades of certification infrastructure and existing Medicaid reimbursement. California targets regional deployment with perinatal CHWs in Central Valley and chronic disease CHWs in Northern California tribal areas, though certification pause and rate inadequacy create sustainability questions. Georgia did not fund CHW deployment in its RHTP award, representing the clearest example of social care component elimination under partial funding. States with strong CHW foundation (Texas, Minnesota, Oregon, Washington) benefit from established certification, training infrastructure, and Medicaid reimbursement, allowing RHTP to scale existing programs with reasonable sustainability prospects. States with minimal CHW infrastructure (Mississippi, Alabama, parts of Georgia) lack certification programs, training pipelines, and Medicaid reimbursement, requiring RHTP to build foundational infrastructure with limited time for sustainability development.

The fundamental sustainability question is whether CHW positions created through RHTP will survive beyond 2030. The optimistic scenario holds that states build CHW Medicaid reimbursement infrastructure during RHTP that sustains programs after federal funding ends, as Texas and Oregon demonstrate. The pessimistic scenario holds that CHW positions depending on RHTP funding disappear in 2030 when federal support ends, with the workforce built over five years dispersing within months. Realistic assessment suggests sustainability will vary by state, with established certification and active Medicaid reimbursement sustaining significant capacity while states relying primarily on RHTP funding without building sustainability infrastructure will see substantial program contraction.

CHW programs can support rural health transformation when conditions preserve community identity: community-based employment or contracts protecting identity, training that adds to rather than replaces community knowledge, roles defined by community connection rather than clinical task completion, sustainable financing not dependent on clinical productivity, and supervision valuing community perspective. Evidence confirms CHW interventions improve outcomes across multiple conditions and populations, though questions remain about which models work best, how much training improves versus undermines effectiveness, which employment structures preserve community identity, and what reimbursement rates enable sustainability. Long-term sustainability under Medicaid financing remains uncertain, as does whether clinical integration inevitably absorbs community identity and how to scale programs without losing effectiveness.

Healthcare employment absorbing CHWs into clinical culture creates predictable dynamics: initial enthusiasm for community connection, gradual pressure from clinical productivity expectations, identity erosion as CHWs adopt clinical perspectives, and effectiveness decline as community members perceive CHWs as clinic representatives rather than neighbors. **This trajectory is not inevitable but is common**, requiring conscious organizational effort to resist institutional absorption pressure. The healthcare integration perspective deserves assessment, holding that better clinical knowledge enables better patient support, that healthcare employment provides stability enabling long-term community service, and that clinical supervision ensures quality. Healthcare systems have resources and infrastructure that community organizations lack, with CBO-employed CHWs facing 50% annual turnover partly because CBOs cannot provide competitive wages and benefits. Yet whether these benefits require clinical absorption or can be achieved while preserving community identity remains the central question.

Evidence suggests preservation is possible but requires intentional effort. Healthcare systems must actively protect CHW community identity, training programs must build on rather than replace community knowledge, and care team integration must value community perspective rather than simply absorbing CHWs into clinical culture. Hybrid arrangements that protect community identity while
