> *"Before you can change what people do, you must understand what they believe. And before you can understand what they believe, you must stop assuming you already know."*

The previous articles traced the material and social conditions of rural life: the geography, the people, the institutions, the infrastructure. This article turns to something less visible but equally determinative: the ideas, values, and beliefs that shape how rural Americans understand their world, make decisions, and respond to those who would help them.

Beliefs matter for health. What people believe about their bodies, about illness and healing, about expertise and institutions, about fate and agency, shapes whether and how they seek care, whether they follow recommendations, and how they interpret their experiences of health and sickness. Understanding these beliefs is not a matter of curiosity but a practical prerequisite for health transformation.

Rural America harbors beliefs that urban and suburban America often misunderstands, dismisses, or caricatures. The faith traditions, the commitment to self-reliance, the skepticism toward institutions, the fatalism that coexists with determination, the political identities that have become cultural identities. **These are not pathologies to be corrected but worldviews to be understood**, engaged, and, where appropriate, worked with rather than against.

This article explores the belief landscape of rural America with the same respect for complexity that previous articles brought to geography and economics. Rural beliefs are not uniform, not irrational, and not impervious to engagement. They are, like all human beliefs, the products of history, experience, and the contexts within which people live.

## Faith and Religion

Religion occupies a more central place in rural American life than in urban and suburban America. Church attendance is higher, religious identity more salient, and religious institutions more woven into community fabric. Understanding rural health requires understanding rural faith.

### The Religious Landscape

Protestant Christianity dominates rural America, though with substantial internal diversity. Mainline denominations, including Methodist, Lutheran, Presbyterian, and Episcopalian, have historical presence but declining membership. Evangelical and Pentecostal churches have grown, particularly in the South and parts of the Midwest. Baptist churches in their various branches are common across much of rural America.

Catholicism has significant presence in regions of Catholic settlement: portions of the Upper Midwest, South Louisiana, parts of the Southwest, and areas with substantial Hispanic populations. The Catholic parish in a rural town may be one of few institutions connecting residents to a universal organization.

The religiously unaffiliated have grown in rural areas as they have nationally, though at slower rates. Younger rural residents are more likely than their grandparents to claim no religious affiliation. The trend suggests that rural religious exceptionalism may be weakening, though religious participation remains higher than in urban areas.

Other traditions have local presence: Latter-day Saints in the Intermountain West, various Protestant sects in specific regions, and growing religious diversity in areas with immigrant populations. The assumption that rural America is homogeneously Protestant overlooks actual variation.

### Church as Institution

The church building serves functions beyond worship that make it central to rural community life. The social functions described in the social fabric article, including gathering space, mutual aid coordination, and social support, flow through religious institutions.

Clergy serve roles that extend beyond religious leadership. **The pastor may be the closest available approximation to a counselor for mental health concerns.** The minister may visit the sick and support the dying in ways that professional pastoral care cannot reach. Religious leaders hold social capital and community trust that secular authorities may lack.

Churches provide practical services: food pantries, clothing assistance, emergency aid, transportation help. These services often fill gaps left by absent or inadequate public programs. The theology may emphasize charity, but the effect is social service provision through religious channels.

### Faith and Health Beliefs

Religious belief shapes health beliefs and behaviors through multiple pathways. These pathways can support health or undermine it, and often do both simultaneously.

**Prayer and healing** represent one dimension. Many rural residents believe in the efficacy of prayer for healing. This belief may complement medical treatment, with prayer offered alongside medication, or it may substitute for medical treatment, with prayer offered instead of seeking care. The substitution pattern causes harm when it delays necessary treatment, while the complementary pattern appears largely harmless and may provide psychological benefit.

**Fatalism with religious grounding** represents another dimension. The belief that outcomes are determined by divine will can reduce anxiety by removing the burden of control. It can also reduce motivation for preventive behavior if outcomes are predetermined regardless of action. The statement "when my time comes, it will come" expresses a fatalism that discourages worry but may also discourage screening, prevention, and early intervention.

**Stewardship of the body** provides a different religious framing. The body as temple, as gift from God requiring care, motivates health behaviors. This framing appears in various traditions and can support preventive care, healthy behaviors, and medical treatment as fulfillment of religious obligation.

**End-of-life beliefs** affect healthcare decisions profoundly. Beliefs about afterlife, about the meaning of suffering, about the sanctity of life, and about when to accept death shape decisions about aggressive treatment, palliative care, and dying. Rural residents may bring religious frameworks to these decisions that differ from the secular frameworks that medical ethics often assumes.

### Faith and Science

The relationship between religious belief and scientific authority is more complex than popular stereotypes suggest. Rural religious believers are not uniformly anti-science. Many hold religious beliefs alongside acceptance of medical science, evolutionary biology, and other scientific findings. Others hold beliefs that conflict with scientific consensus on particular issues.

The conflicts that attract attention (creationism versus evolution, vaccine hesitancy linked to religious belief, skepticism toward pandemic measures) represent real phenomena that affect health. They should not be generalized to characterize all rural religious belief. Most rural Christians accept antibiotics, seek medical care for serious illness, and do not interpret their faith as requiring rejection of modern medicine.

Where conflicts do exist, they often reflect broader patterns of distrust toward institutional authority rather than purely religious objection. The rural believer skeptical of vaccines may be as much skeptical of government and pharmaceutical companies as skeptical of the science itself. Understanding the actual sources of resistance is necessary for effective engagement.

## Self-Reliance and Independence

Perhaps no value is more central to rural identity than self-reliance. The belief that individuals and families should take care of themselves, should solve their own problems, and should not depend on others, shapes rural responses to everything from economic hardship to health challenges.

### Historical Roots

Self-reliance has historical grounding in rural experience. Frontier settlement required solving problems without help because help was unavailable. Agricultural life required adapting to conditions that could not be controlled. Distance from institutions meant that waiting for assistance was not viable.

These historical conditions produced cultural adaptations that persist even as conditions have changed. **The value placed on self-sufficiency outlived the necessity that produced it.** Self-reliance became not merely practical adaptation but moral value, distinguishing virtuous independence from shameful dependence.

The mythology of the American West reinforced self-reliance as cultural ideal. The independent farmer, the self-sufficient homesteader, the rugged individual succeeding through determination: these images populated cultural imagination even when they simplified actual histories of mutual dependence and government support.

### Contemporary Expression

Self-reliance manifests in contemporary rural life in patterns that affect health:

The reluctance to seek help until absolutely necessary reflects self-reliance values. Asking for help signals failure to manage independently. The rural resident may delay seeking medical care, delay applying for benefits, delay asking family for support, each delay an expression of determination to handle things alone.

The commitment to working through difficulty reflects self-reliance. The farmer who continues working despite injury, the laborer who ignores symptoms that would send others to doctors, the family that refuses assistance while struggling financially: all express self-reliance that may harm even as it affirms identity.

**The DIY orientation extends to health.** Home remedies, self-diagnosis, self-treatment, and reluctance to "bother" doctors with problems that might resolve on their own all flow from self-reliance values. This orientation sometimes produces appropriate self-care and sometimes produces harmful delay.

### Health Implications

Self-reliance values directly affect health behaviors and healthcare utilization. The reluctance to seek care delays diagnosis and treatment. The unwillingness to appear weak or dependent prevents disclosure of symptoms. The determination to manage independently means problems must become crises before help is sought.

The implications extend to mental health. Admitting to depression, anxiety, or other mental distress contradicts self-reliance values. The person who "should" be handling their problems admits weakness by acknowledging they cannot. **Stigma against mental health help-seeking is intertwined with self-reliance values** that make seeking any help shameful.

Understanding self-reliance as cultural value rather than personality defect enables more effective engagement. Interventions framed as supporting independence may succeed where interventions framed as providing help fail. The same service, presented as enabling self-management versus providing assistance, may produce different uptake based on how it aligns with or threatens self-reliance identity.

## Attitudes Toward Institutions

Rural Americans relate to institutions, including government, healthcare, and expertise, in patterns that differ from urban and suburban norms. Understanding these patterns reveals why well-intentioned interventions may fail and why distrust must be addressed rather than ignored.

### Government Distrust

Distrust of government runs deep in rural America, though its character varies. The distrust has historical grounding: federal policies have harmed rural communities through extraction of resources, displacement of populations, broken promises of support, and regulation perceived as burdensome.

Agricultural policy has repeatedly disrupted rural economies, favoring consolidation that destroyed family farms while claiming to support them. Environmental regulation has restricted land use in ways that feel like distant bureaucrats controlling local decisions. Trade policy has exposed rural industries to competition without adequate transition support. The list of grievances is long, and the grievances are not imaginary.

Distrust varies by level of government. Local government, including county officials, sheriffs, and school boards, may retain trust because these officials are known community members. State government occupies a middle position. Federal government attracts the most distrust, experienced as distant, unaccountable, and indifferent to rural concerns.

The partisan dimension complicates analysis. Rural America has shifted toward the Republican Party, which rhetorically opposes big government. Political identity and government distrust reinforce each other. Yet rural residents also depend on federal programs, including Medicare, Social Security, farm subsidies, and infrastructure funding, creating tensions between ideology and material interest.

### Healthcare System Skepticism

Distrust extends specifically to healthcare institutions. Rural residents have had experiences that justify skepticism: dismissive providers, incorrect diagnoses, bills that devastate household finances, facilities that closed when communities needed them.

**The perception that healthcare is a profit-driven industry rather than a caring profession feeds skepticism.** When hospitals prioritize revenue over service, when pharmaceutical companies raise prices, when insurance companies deny claims, the rural observer concludes that the system serves itself rather than patients.

Geographic distance compounds distrust. The hospital is far away, its staff are strangers, its ways are unfamiliar. The local doctor who knew patients and their families has been replaced by rotating physicians from elsewhere. The personal relationships that once characterized rural medicine have given way to impersonal systems.

Healthcare skepticism affects utilization. The rural resident who distrusts the healthcare system may delay care, reject recommendations, or avoid the system entirely until crisis forces engagement. Trust-building requires addressing legitimate grievances, not merely dismissing skepticism as ignorance.

### Expert Skepticism

Rural skepticism extends to expertise itself. The expert who arrives with credentials but without local knowledge may be viewed with suspicion. The consultant who studies the community without living in it may be dismissed. The researcher who collects data and then leaves may be resented.

This skepticism has rational basis. Experts have often been wrong about rural communities. Development schemes have failed. Policies have backfired. Research has produced findings that did not translate into improvement. **The track record of outside expertise in rural contexts is mixed at best.**

The skepticism also reflects a valuation of experiential knowledge that formal education does not capture. The farmer knows things about the land that the agricultural scientist does not. The longtime resident understands community dynamics that the visiting sociologist misses. Rural people often believe, with some justification, that their knowledge deserves respect alongside or instead of credentialed expertise.

For health interventions, expert skepticism means that credentialed authority alone cannot ensure acceptance. Interventions must demonstrate understanding of local context, must incorporate local knowledge, and must earn trust through relationship rather than assuming it based on qualifications.

## Fatalism and Agency

Rural worldviews contain complex relationships between fate and agency, between acceptance and determination. These relationships shape how people respond to health challenges and how they evaluate interventions.

### Fatalistic Tendencies

Fatalism appears in various forms across rural America. Religious fatalism locates outcomes in divine will, accepting what comes as God's plan. Genetic fatalism locates health outcomes in heredity: "heart disease runs in my family" as explanation and prediction. Economic fatalism locates outcomes in forces beyond individual control: the market, the weather, the policy decisions of distant authorities.

**Fatalism serves psychological functions.** Accepting what cannot be changed reduces anxiety and preserves equanimity. The farmer cannot control the weather, and accepting this reality prevents futile struggle against the uncontrollable. Extending this acceptance to other domains generalizes a coping mechanism that works in some contexts.

The health implications of fatalism are double-edged. Fatalism may reduce anxiety but may also reduce motivation for prevention. If outcomes are predetermined, why screen for cancer, manage blood pressure, or modify diet? The fatalistic response to health risk discounts the possibility that individual action can affect outcomes.

### Agency and Determination

Yet fatalism coexists with its apparent opposite: fierce determination and sense of agency. The same farmer who accepts the weather works relentlessly to maximize yield given weather conditions. The same rural resident who attributes outcomes to God's will struggles mightily to overcome obstacles. The contradiction is more apparent than real.

**Rural agency often manifests as adaptation and problem-solving within constraints that are accepted as given.** One does not challenge the constraints but works within them. This pattern of bounded agency, active within accepted limits, characterizes much rural response to difficulty.

Resilience, the capacity to absorb adversity and recover, represents agency in the face of hardship. Rural communities have demonstrated remarkable resilience through economic transitions, natural disasters, and social changes. This resilience reflects agency even when fatalism provides the accompanying worldview.

### Implications for Health Intervention

Health interventions that assume autonomous individual agency may misalign with rural worldviews that locate agency within constraints. The intervention that promises individuals can control their health outcomes may not resonate with those who understand health as subject to forces beyond individual control.

More effective approaches may frame health actions as responses to constraints rather than assertions of control. Managing diabetes through diet and medication responds to a condition that has occurred rather than claiming to prevent what fate has determined. **The framing matters, and framing that respects fatalistic elements of worldview may achieve what framing that contradicts them cannot.**

## Political Identity

Politics in rural America has become inseparable from cultural identity in ways that affect health. Positions on healthcare policy, health behaviors during the pandemic, and responses to public health guidance have all been shaped by political identity. Understanding this dimension is necessary for understanding rural health.

### The Political Landscape

Rural America has shifted dramatically toward the Republican Party over recent decades. Counties that voted Democratic within living memory now vote Republican by large margins. The shift reflects many factors: cultural alignment, economic grievance, demographic change, and the sorting of the parties along cultural lines.

The shift has made political identity salient in rural communities in new ways. To be rural is, in much of America, to be assumed conservative. Those who do not fit this assumption may feel marginalized. Those who do fit it may experience political identity as affirmation of belonging.

**Political identity has become tribal in ways that extend beyond policy preferences.** Being conservative means aligning with conservative positions across domains, including health domains. The political meaning of masks, vaccines, and public health measures during the pandemic illustrated how health behaviors became identity markers.

### Healthcare as Political Battleground

Healthcare policy divides along partisan lines, with rural health caught in the crossfire. The Affordable Care Act, Medicaid expansion, and proposals for universal coverage all generate partisan conflict. Rural communities that might benefit from these policies may oppose them on political grounds, while communities that support them may lack the political power to secure them.

**Medicaid expansion exemplifies the pattern.** States that declined expansion, disproportionately Southern and rural, left their rural residents without coverage that expansion would have provided. The decisions reflected political opposition to the ACA rather than assessment of rural health needs. Rural residents in non-expansion states bear health consequences of political positioning.

The Rural Health Transformation Program established in 2025 operates within this political context. Its creation responded partly to political needs, with funding directed toward rural areas as part of broader political calculations. Whether the program will produce health transformation or primarily serve political purposes remains to be determined.

### Navigating Political Identity

Health interventions in rural America cannot ignore political identity, but they can navigate it. Interventions that avoid partisan coding, that are delivered through trusted local institutions rather than politically suspect channels, and that are framed in non-political terms may succeed where politically marked interventions fail.

**The messenger matters as much as the message.** Information delivered by local physicians, faith leaders, or respected community members may be received differently than the same information delivered by government agencies or media outlets associated with opposing political identity.

## Trust and Its Foundations

Beneath specific attitudes toward institutions, expertise, and government lies the broader question of trust: whom rural Americans trust, why, and what builds or destroys trust.

### In-Group Trust

Trust within rural communities can be high. People trust those they know, those connected through kinship or longtime residence, those who have demonstrated trustworthiness through past behavior. This bonding trust enables the mutual aid and community cooperation described in earlier articles.

In-group trust provides a foundation that interventions can potentially build upon. Engaging trusted community members as intermediaries, working through established networks, and demonstrating commitment to community over time can extend trust to those initially viewed as outsiders.

### Out-Group Skepticism

Trust toward outsiders is lower and harder to earn. The visitor, the newcomer, the representative of distant institutions all begin from a position of skepticism. They must demonstrate trustworthiness rather than assume it.

**Out-group skepticism is rational given history.** Rural communities have been exploited by those claiming to help. Projects have been started and abandoned. Researchers have extracted information and provided nothing in return. Corporations have made promises and left when convenient. The skepticism toward outsiders reflects accumulated experience.

### Building Trust

Trust is built through consistent behavior over time. The healthcare provider who stays, who becomes part of the community, who treats patients as neighbors rather than cases, can earn trust that rotating temporary providers cannot. The program that maintains presence through difficulties, that adapts to community feedback, that delivers what it promises, can earn trust that flashy short-term initiatives cannot.

**Trust requires reciprocity.** The community member who helps a neighbor expects, eventually, that help will be returned. The outside organization that only extracts, whether data or resources or compliance, violates reciprocity expectations. Interventions that give as well as take, that provide visible benefit, that acknowledge what communities contribute, align with reciprocity norms.

**Trust requires respect.** The expert who dismisses local knowledge, the official who condescends, the program that imposes without consultation, all destroy trust through disrespect. Interventions that demonstrate genuine respect for rural people and their knowledge have far better prospects than those that do not.

## Generational Differences

Rural belief systems are not static across generations. Younger rural residents differ from older ones in patterns that matter for health transformation.

### Older Generations

Rural residents over 65 grew up in different communities than exist today. They remember when towns had more services, when farms were smaller, when communities were more self-sufficient. Their values were formed in that context.

Older generations tend to hold more traditional religious beliefs, stronger self-reliance values, and more conservative political identities. They also hold institutional memories that younger generations lack: knowledge of how things used to work, relationships built over decades, connections to community history.

### Younger Generations

Younger rural residents have grown up with different experiences. They have used the internet from childhood. They have watched opportunities leave. They have seen the communities of their parents and grandparents diminish.

Younger rural residents show somewhat weaker religious affiliation, more diverse political views, and different relationships to self-reliance values. They may be more willing to seek help, more comfortable with technology, and more open to change.

Yet many younger rural residents have chosen to stay or return, a choice that itself reflects values. Those who stayed when others left often did so because they valued what rural life offers. Their relationship to rural identity may be more intentional than that of those who simply never left.

### Implications

Generational differences suggest that rural belief systems are changing, that what characterizes older rural residents may not characterize younger ones, and that interventions may be received differently by different age groups.

**Effective interventions may need to be adapted for different generations.** What works for elder rural residents may not work for younger ones, and vice versa. The one-size-fits-all approach misses generational variation that can determine success or failure.

## Key States in Belief System Patterns

Belief systems vary regionally in ways that matter for health transformation:

**Kentucky** and **West Virginia** combine deep religious faith with self-reliance values forged in Appalachian isolation. Distrust of outside institutions is pronounced. These states have experienced the opioid crisis most severely, and the failure of institutions to prevent or adequately respond to that crisis has deepened distrust.

**Mississippi** and **Alabama** share Southern religious intensity with historical patterns of racial inequality that shape beliefs differently for Black and white rural residents. Faith communities remain central to social life, and healthcare interventions that engage faith communities have shown success.

**Texas** contains multiple belief system regions. East Texas shares Southern patterns. West Texas and the Panhandle have distinct Western orientations. The border region includes Hispanic cultural and religious patterns. No single characterization captures Texas rural beliefs.

**Oklahoma** combines Southern, Western, and Native American belief patterns. Native American populations hold distinct worldviews that must be understood on their own terms rather than assimilated to general rural patterns.

**Montana**, **Wyoming**, and other Mountain West states have libertarian tendencies distinct from Southern conservatism. Individual freedom as paramount value shapes attitudes toward government and healthcare interventions differently than religious conservatism does.

**South Dakota** and **North Dakota** include significant Native American populations alongside Northern European heritage populations. Belief systems differ substantially between these groups, and effective intervention requires distinguishing them.

## The External View

Urban and suburban observers often misread rural belief systems in ways that undermine engagement.

### Dismissing Beliefs as Ignorance

**The assumption that rural beliefs reflect ignorance, that education would correct them, misunderstands the nature of belief.** People hold beliefs that serve functions: psychological, social, and practical. Dismissing beliefs as ignorance insults rural people and fails to engage the actual reasons beliefs are held.

### Political Caricature

Reducing rural beliefs to political stereotype misses complexity. Not all rural people hold conservative beliefs. Not all conservatives hold identical beliefs. The variation within rural America exceeds what political labels capture.

### Missing Internal Logic

Rural beliefs that appear irrational from outside often have internal logic that makes sense within context. Self-reliance that delays care-seeking makes sense when help has historically been unavailable. Distrust of institutions makes sense when institutions have failed. Understanding the internal logic enables engagement that dismissal prevents.

### Coastal Condescension

The perception that coastal elites look down on rural America is not merely perception. Media representations, political rhetoric, and everyday discourse often convey condescension toward rural people and their beliefs. **This condescension is noticed and resented, and it destroys the trust that effective intervention requires.**

## Politics and Policy

Belief systems shape policy possibilities. Policy approaches that align with rural beliefs have better prospects than those that contradict them.

### Messaging and Framing

How health interventions are framed affects whether they align with or threaten rural beliefs. Framing that emphasizes individual choice, family protection, and community wellbeing may succeed where framing that emphasizes compliance with expert recommendations fails.

The same intervention can be presented multiple ways. The vaccine that prevents disease can be framed as protecting your family, exercising your freedom to stay healthy, or doing what government recommends. The first two framings align with rural values better than the third.

### Community-Based Approaches

Interventions delivered through trusted community institutions and local people have better prospects than those delivered through distant authorities. Community health workers, lay health advisors, and faith community partnerships leverage existing trust rather than requiring trust to be built from scratch.

### Respecting Autonomy

Rural self-reliance values demand respect for autonomy. Interventions that tell people what to do trigger resistance. Interventions that provide information and options, that respect people's capacity to make their own decisions, align better with rural values.

This does not mean abandoning the goal of behavior change. It means pursuing behavior change through persuasion rather than dictation, through empowerment rather than command.

### Trusted Messengers

Who delivers the message determines how it is received. Local physicians trusted by their communities carry credibility that national experts lack. Faith leaders carry authority on health matters through their moral standing. Peer educators who share characteristics with target populations can reach people that professionals cannot.

**Investing in trusted messenger approaches, rather than assuming that credentialed expertise automatically confers trust, represents policy learning from rural belief system realities.**

## Conclusion

Rural belief systems shape health behaviors and responses to intervention in ways that cannot be ignored. Faith, self-reliance, institutional distrust, fatalism, political identity, and patterns of trust all affect whether rural health transformation is possible and how it might occur.

**These beliefs are not pathologies to be corrected but worldviews to be understood and engaged.** Effective intervention requires meeting people where they are, not where interventionists wish they were. The beliefs that seem irrational from outside often have internal logic that makes sense within rural contexts.

The final article in this foundational series examines lifestyles and culture: the daily rhythms, practices, and traditions that constitute rural life. Understanding how rural people actually live, beyond the beliefs they hold, completes the portrait of rural America that health transformation must engage.

*This is the ninth article in Series 1: Understanding Rural and Deep Rural America. The series continues with Article 1J: Lifestyles and Culture, examining the daily rhythms, practices, and cultural patterns that shape rural health behaviors.*
