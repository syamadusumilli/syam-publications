## Purpose

This technical document provides **empirical grounding** for all ten articles in Series 1. Rather than embedding dense statistical tables within narrative articles, this companion consolidates key metrics, sources, and comparative data in a single reference document.

**Three functions:**

1. **Evidence repository** for claims made throughout Series 1
2. **Quick reference** for researchers needing specific rural statistics
3. **Baseline documentation** supporting subsequent series analysis

**Usage note:** Data reflects most recent available estimates as of late 2024 and early 2025. Figures represent ranges in some cases due to varying definitions and methodologies across sources.

## Data Currency Notes

Data represents most recent available estimates as of late 2024 and early 2025. Some figures reflect ranges due to varying definitions across sources. Users should verify specific statistics against primary sources for time-sensitive applications.

## Methodological Limitations

Definitions of "rural" vary across federal agencies, creating comparability challenges. Census Bureau, OMB, and USDA each use different classification systems. This companion primarily uses USDA ERS nonmetro/metro distinction unless otherwise noted.

See **1-TD-B: Rural Classification Reference Guide** for detailed analysis of classification systems and their concordance.
