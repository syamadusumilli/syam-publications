The CMS analyst confronts an uncomfortable truth as she reviews 50 state applications for the Rural Health Transformation Program: the worst mortality corridors in America ignore state lines entirely, while the $50 billion federal investment flows exclusively through state boundaries. Central Appalachia's opioid crisis spans Kentucky, West Virginia, Virginia, Tennessee, and Ohio as a single regional catastrophe receiving five fragmented responses. The Mississippi Delta's maternal mortality emergency crosses Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana with no coordination requirement. The Black Belt's persistent poverty tracks an agricultural history across eight states, each developing separate strategies for what functions as a unified challenge. Meanwhile, the Navajo Nation spanning Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah must navigate three different state RHTP systems despite being a single sovereign government. The fundamental question emerges with clarity: **can state-administered transformation address regional challenges that cross state boundaries, constitute distinct sub-state areas, or involve sovereign tribal nations?**

Series 10's examination of 18 distinct rural regions produces a qualified and uncomfortable answer. State administration represents an imperfect fit for regional reality, yet remains the available mechanism for most populations. American federalism flows through states because the Constitution establishes states as primary governance units below the federal level. Health policy has followed this architecture since Medicaid's creation in 1965. CMS possesses no mechanism to fund regions directly, no pathway to bypass states, no authority to require interstate coordination. The mismatch between regional challenges and state-based funding is structural, not incidental. RHTP's designers did not overlook regional reality; they accepted state administration as the available mechanism despite its fundamental limitations.

The evidence across regions reveals consistent patterns of governance mismatch. **Multi-state regions share challenges that single-state strategies cannot adequately address.** Appalachia's 13-state fragmentation prevents coordinated workforce development, shared technology platforms, or aligned hospital network planning that the region requires. The Mississippi Delta spans three states with identical poverty, maternal mortality, and infrastructure collapse demanding coordinated response that no state can independently deliver. The Great Plains stretch across ten states facing common depopulation, extreme distance, and provider shortage patterns that state boundaries arbitrarily fragment. Each region possesses coherent challenges but fragmented governance, with no existing mechanism for the coordination that transformation requires.

Within states, the governance problem manifests differently but with equal consequence. **Sub-state regions possess distinct needs that state strategies frequently flatten into uniformity.** Texas contains frontier High Plains, agricultural Piney Woods, and binational border regions, each requiring fundamentally different approaches that a single state strategy struggles to accommodate. Ohio's Appalachian counties share more epidemiologically with West Virginia than with Ohio's agricultural northwest, yet receive identical state-level intervention. When states apply uniform strategies across internal diversity, they generate approaches appropriate for some regions but inadequate for others. Texas's RHTP application demonstrates the alternative, explicitly differentiating border, Panhandle, East Texas, and Central Texas with tailored approaches for each. Kentucky's application prioritizes Appalachian counties with recognition of their distinct challenges. These states acknowledge internal variation. Others do not, and their transformation strategies suffer accordingly.

For sovereign tribal nations, state administration represents not merely poor fit but **categorical error that better implementation cannot correct.** Tribal nations are sovereign governments with treaty-based healthcare rights, not demographic groups requiring state attention. The 36 states containing tribal lands cannot appropriately mediate the federal-tribal relationship that tribal healthcare depends upon. The Navajo Nation's healthcare transformation receives RHTP funding from three different state systems with no coordination mechanism for what should function as unified tribal health infrastructure. Pine Ridge spans North and South Dakota, fragmenting what sovereignty demands remain whole. The evidence from tribally-operated healthcare systems under 638 contracting demonstrates that tribal self-determination produces better outcomes than either IHS direct service or state-administered programs. RHTP could have aligned with this evidence through direct federal-tribal pathways. It did not, embedding a fundamental sovereignty violation into program architecture.

Climate change introduces a fourth dimension of governance mismatch that challenges transformation's basic premises. **Alaska Native villages experiencing coastal erosion may not exist at current locations by 2035**, the midpoint of RHTP's transformation timeline. Great Plains communities depleting the Ogallala Aquifer face agricultural collapse within decades, undermining the economic foundation that healthcare investment assumes. Florida's rural healthcare infrastructure faces hurricane and flooding threats that question infrastructure investment wisdom. Building a $10 million facility in a community that may not exist at its current location represents not transformation but waste, yet current RHTP architecture contains no mechanism for incorporating climate viability into investment decisions.

Cross-regional synthesis of Series 10's 18 region examinations reveals which governance mismatches matter most. Multi-state regions with very high regional response needs include Appalachia, the Mississippi Delta, and tribal lands, where state administration fundamentally cannot address coordination requirements that transformation demands. The Texas-Mexico border's binational reality and Alaska's climate threats similarly exceed what state-administered programs can address. Regions with high response needs like the Black Belt, Ozarks, and Great Plains suffer from state fragmentation but could potentially benefit from voluntary interstate coordination. Moderate needs characterize regions like the Upland South, Rocky Mountain West, and Intermountain West, where explicit sub-state targeting within state strategies could address regional distinctiveness if states choose to implement such targeting.

Good administrative fit occurs rarely and under specific conditions. Northern New England benefits from small-state coordination capacity, progressive politics, and regional coherence within manageable interstate relationships. Florida Rural exists entirely within one state, eliminating coordination challenges. Alaska's extreme conditions paradoxically create good administrative fit because the entire challenge falls within single-state authority, though the challenges themselves exceed what any state-administered transformation can address. These exceptions prove the rule: **state administration fits regional reality when regional challenges happen to align with state boundaries**, not because the system was designed to address regional variation.

The patterns support six core findings with varying confidence levels. First, with high confidence, state administration cannot address multi-state regional challenges. The evidence is consistent across regions that fragmentation prevents coordinated response. The Appalachian Regional Commission demonstrates both possibility and limitation; ARC provides regional research, convening, and economic development investment but has no health authority and cannot administer RHTP funds or require interstate coordination. The Delta Regional Authority has even less healthcare engagement. Regional governance is possible, as these entities prove, but current regional governance does not extend to healthcare transformation.

Second, also with high confidence, within-state regional variation requires explicit targeting that many states do not provide. States applying uniform approaches disadvantage regions whose challenges differ from state averages. Texas and Kentucky demonstrate that explicit regional targeting is possible within state administration. Ohio and Georgia demonstrate that absence of such targeting flattens essential variation. The implication is direct: CMS should require state plans to address within-state regional variation, and states should develop differentiated approaches for distinct internal regions rather than treating all rural areas identically.

Third, with high confidence, historical understanding must inform current intervention. Regional challenges have historical roots that shape present conditions and intervention possibilities. The Black Belt's health outcomes reflect 400 years of plantation extraction that created persistent poverty, infrastructure absence, and political exclusion. Appalachian health reflects coal industry exploitation and abandonment. Tribal health reflects colonization and treaty violation. **Transformation ignorant of history repeats failures and generates community resistance** that undermines implementation. Historical understanding should inform intervention design without paralyzing action, acknowledging why regions differ, why standard approaches fail, why community distrust exists.

Fourth, with moderate-high confidence, place-based investment is appropriate for some regions but not all. The Great Plains and Alaska reveal transformation's limits. Some communities cannot sustain healthcare infrastructure at any investment level because population is too sparse, distance too great, decline too advanced, or climate threat too immediate. The evidence suggests distinguishing between sustainable and unsustainable places, though precise criteria remain contested. Communities below approximately 3,000 service area population, with steep continued decline, without economic diversification, and facing climate viability questions may benefit more from enhanced transportation, telehealth, and relocation support than from facility investment that delays but cannot prevent closure. Communities with service area population above 5,000, stable or slowing decline, economic diversification, and strong community institutions warrant infrastructure investment. The sustainability distinction is not about abandoning places but about serving people in places that cannot sustain traditional infrastructure through alternative mechanisms rather than investing in facilities that cannot succeed.

Fifth, with very high confidence, tribal sovereignty requires government-to-government relationships that state RHTP cannot provide. The evidence from tribally-operated healthcare systems is unambiguous: tribal self-determination produces better outcomes. State administration fragments tribal healthcare that should be unified, violates sovereignty that should be respected, and contradicts evidence about what works. The implication exceeds RHTP implementation and requires policy change: direct federal-tribal RHTP pathway, multi-state provisions for nations spanning boundaries, tribal priority authority allowing tribes to define transformation rather than accepting state definitions.

Sixth, with moderate-high confidence, climate increasingly shapes regional healthcare viability in ways transformation must address. Alaska villages facing relocation decisions, Great Plains communities depleting aquifers, Florida confronting hurricanes, and border regions experiencing extreme heat all demonstrate that **infrastructure investment in climate-threatened
