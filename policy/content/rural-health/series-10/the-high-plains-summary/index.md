The Rural Health Transformation Program confronts its most uncomfortable question in the High Plains: whether federal healthcare investment makes sense in communities whose underlying economy has a known expiration date. The answer requires acknowledging constraints that transformation alone cannot overcome.

The Ogallala Aquifer powers one of the world's most productive agricultural regions. Center-pivot irrigation drawing from this massive underground reservoir transformed semi-arid grassland into the source of 20 percent of the nation's wheat, corn, cotton, and cattle. Towns that received only 15 to 20 inches of annual rainfall built hospitals, schools, and civic infrastructure around crops requiring 30 or more inches of water. The transformation was extraordinary, but the aquifer is depleting. Water levels in southwestern Kansas dropped more than 1.5 feet in 2024 alone, the largest annual decline in recent years. A University of Texas projection indicates that **up to 70 percent of the Texas Panhandle will become unusable within 20 years** if current pumping rates continue. Thirty percent of Kansas access points have already run dry.

The Ogallala is a fossil aquifer, recharged primarily during the last Ice Age. It receives less than one inch of recharge annually in most areas while irrigation extracts feet per year. States understood from early decades that extraction exceeded recharge. Rather than restrict pumping, Kansas adopted what it explicitly termed a **policy of planned depletion**, gradually emptying the aquifer to support agriculture with full knowledge the water would eventually run out. The calculation made sense when timelines seemed distant. A 100-year depletion schedule felt like someone else's problem. The calculation makes less sense as the timeline compresses. Kansas officials acknowledge some areas lack water to last another 25 years. The Texas Panhandle faces even shorter timelines in heavily pumped areas.

RHTP runs through 2030. The aquifer crisis will intensify beyond 2030 in most areas and become existential in some. The program must therefore address whether transformation funding should invest in hospitals and workforce infrastructure for communities that may not exist in their current form by 2050. This is not abstract policy speculation. Every Critical Access Hospital in the Texas Panhandle, every primary care practice in western Kansas, every nursing home in the Oklahoma Panhandle serves a community whose agricultural economy depends on water that is running out. Healthcare planning cannot ignore the water planning that will ultimately determine whether communities persist.

The High Plains contain roughly 3 million people across the semi-arid western portion of the Great Plains, stretching from the Texas Panhandle through western Kansas. The region's healthcare infrastructure developed to serve populations and economies that existed when water seemed unlimited. **Infrastructure assumptions that made sense in 1980 do not necessarily make sense in 2025**, when the temporal limits of the underlying economy have become clear. Hospitals built in prosperous agricultural decades now serve declining populations with eroding economic bases. Workforce challenges compound infrastructure stress because providers considering rural practice see declining populations and uncertain futures. Why build a career in a community that may not exist in 20 years? Service line reductions precede closures as hospitals eliminate obstetrics, surgery, and specialty services before closing entirely.

Different portions of the High Plains face different timelines. Southwest Kansas has areas already at Day Zero for irrigation, with monitoring wells showing exhaustion and a timeline for fundamental community transformation of 10 to 25 years. The Texas Panhandle faces widespread impact within 15 to 25 years. Northwest Kansas has deeper aquifer sections with 40 to 60 years remaining at current pumping rates, timelines that conservation could extend significantly. These differentiated timelines matter because **RHTP investment assumes infrastructure will be used**. A hospital expansion completed in 2028 assumes the community will need that hospital in 2040 and beyond. In portions of the High Plains, that assumption is questionable.

The tension between place-based and people-based approaches becomes unavoidable here. The place-based view holds that rural communities deserve healthcare regardless of economic projections. People live there now and need healthcare now. Abandoning communities because of uncertain timelines betrays residents who may spend their entire remaining lives there. The people-based view recognizes that some places may not sustain healthcare infrastructure at any investment level once the economic base disappears. Supporting people's ability to access care, including through relocation assistance, may serve them better than investing in places that cannot sustain services. The evidence suggests both views contain truth. Current residents need current care, but infrastructure investment implicitly bets on community persistence. The honest question is whether that bet makes sense across the full High Plains or only in portions with longer timelines.

Some observers argue that **High Plains transformation should explicitly embrace managed transition** rather than pretending business as usual is possible. Aquifer depletion is irreversible at human timescales. Agricultural transition from irrigation to dryland farming is inevitable. Populations will shrink. Towns will contract or disappear. Healthcare transformation should support transition, not deny it, through telehealth for remaining residents, support for elderly populations aging in place, assistance for those who relocate, and what amounts to hospice for dying communities. This view has significant merit but faces practical challenges. Federal programs cannot easily fund managed decline. Community leaders resist narratives that might accelerate decline by discouraging investment. The managed transition view is analytically sound but practically difficult to implement through RHTP structures designed for growth and sustainability, not graceful contraction.

The appropriate response involves differentiated investment by timeline. Areas with 10 to 25 year timelines should focus on current population service through telehealth, mobile care, and transition support while avoiding major facility investment. Areas with 40 to 60 year timelines may warrant more conventional transformation investment in facility improvements, workforce recruitment, and service line development that can reasonably assume communities will persist for infrastructure lifespans. Areas with successful diversification into tourism, renewable energy, or other economic bases independent of irrigation agriculture may warrant investment similar to other rural areas without aquifer dependence. **Telehealth infrastructure serves current residents and can be repurposed if communities shrink**. Unlike facility construction, telehealth equipment can relocate. Workforce support through loan repayment brings providers now, and when they retire, communities can assess whether replacement makes sense given population trajectories. Mobile health services and community health worker programs provide care without fixed infrastructure assuming community persistence.

State engagement varies in its acknowledgment of aquifer constraints. Texas focuses statewide rather than regionally, with Panhandle counties competing with the Rio Grande Valley and other rural regions for limited resources. The state's right of capture water regime allows landowners to pump without restriction, accelerating depletion. Texas RHTP does not distinguish between rural areas with sustainable economic bases and areas facing irrigation collapse. Kansas has recently acknowledged the aquifer crisis more explicitly, with legislative action in 2024 and 2025 pushing groundwater management districts toward mandatory usage reductions. Kansas represents a potential model for **timeline-differentiated transformation**. The state's groundwater management districts already map aquifer conditions in detail. This mapping could inform healthcare investment decisions, directing facility investment to areas with longer timelines while prioritizing flexible approaches in areas approaching exhaustion. Oklahoma's Panhandle contains three of the state's most isolated counties, with distances exceeding 100 miles to major healthcare facilities in some directions, requiring approaches that combine frontier health strategies with aquifer-aware investment decisions.

What transformation cannot achieve matters as much as what it can. Healthcare infrastructure cannot persist where economic infrastructure collapses. If irrigation agriculture ends and nothing replaces it, towns will shrink below thresholds sustaining healthcare facilities. A hospital requires 5,000 to 10,000 service area population to remain viable. Communities shrinking below these thresholds cannot maintain hospitals regardless of transformation investment. RHTP has no authority over water policy. Aquifer management falls to state water authorities and individual water rights holders. Health outcomes will ultimately be determined by water policy outcomes that RHTP does not control. RHTP should not fund major facility construction in areas where community persistence beyond facility lifespan is questionable. A 30-year mortgage on a hospital serving a community with a 15-year economic timeline creates liability without benefit.

This does not mean abandoning current residents. It means choosing investment approaches appropriate to circumstances. RHTP should serve current High Plains residents because their need does not diminish as aquifer levels fall. RHTP should match investment to circumstances, with telehealth and flexible services making sense everywhere but major facility construction making sense only where community persistence can be reasonably assumed for infrastructure lifespans. RHTP cannot pretend that all High Plains communities will persist. Transformation rhetoric promising sustainable healthcare systems ignores physical constraints that will determine community futures.

The core question remains: can transformation policy acknowledge temporal limits while still serving current populations? The High Plains force this question because **the aquifer's depletion is healthcare policy's outer boundary** in the region. RHTP operates within that boundary but cannot move it. Understanding this constraint is prerequisite for designing transformation approaches that serve current residents while acknowledging limits on what healthcare investment alone can achieve when the underlying economy depends on a depleting resource with a known timeline.
