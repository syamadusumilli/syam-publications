The Piney Woods stretch across **eastern Texas, northern Louisiana, and southwestern Mississippi**, a region of pine forests, timber history, and oil extraction that exists in policy shadow. While the Mississippi Delta commands national attention and Appalachia anchors federal regional policy, the Piney Woods remain **unnamed in federal discourse**, unrecognized by regional authorities, and invisible in transformation planning. Approximately **3 million people** live in this region, experiencing health outcomes that rank among the worst in their respective states, yet lacking the regional identity that channels resources to more recognized crisis zones.

This article examines the tension between **regional identity and external characterization**. Piney Woods residents understand themselves as living in a place, not a problem zone. They identify with their communities, their land, their timber and oil heritage. External funders see distressed rural counties requiring intervention. The gap between these perspectives shapes whether transformation succeeds or fails. **Programs designed for problems cannot reach people who see themselves as communities.**

The Piney Woods challenge the standard regional playbook. Appalachia has the Appalachian Regional Commission. The Delta has the Delta Regional Authority. The Piney Woods have nothing: no regional commission, no federal designation, no dedicated funding stream, no shared identity across state lines. Three state RHTP administrations will address Piney Woods counties as if they were simply rural Texas, rural Louisiana, or rural Mississippi, missing the regional coherence that connects logging communities in Nacogdoches County, Texas, to those in Winn Parish, Louisiana, to those in Amite County, Mississippi.

The evidence suggests that **regional invisibility produces systematic underinvestment** even when need equals or exceeds that of recognized regions. Transformation that treats the Piney Woods as undifferentiated rural area within three states misses the regional patterns that drive health crisis.

## Regional Definition

### Geographic Boundaries

The Piney Woods occupy the **pine forest ecosystem** of the western Gulf Coastal Plain, stretching from the Trinity River in Texas eastward through Louisiana to southwestern Mississippi. Unlike mountain or river boundaries that create obvious regional delineation, pine forest ecology defines this region: longleaf, loblolly, and shortleaf pine species that historically dominated the landscape and shaped economic development.

**Core Counties by State:**

| State | Counties | Population | Notes |
|-------|----------|------------|-------|
| Texas | Angelina, Cherokee, Nacogdoches, Rusk, Shelby, San Augustine, Sabine, Newton, Jasper, Tyler, Polk, Hardin | ~450,000 | Deep East Texas |
| Louisiana | Vernon, Rapides, Grant, Winn, Natchitoches, Sabine, DeSoto, Red River, Bienville, Union, Lincoln, Claiborne | ~380,000 | Northern LA Pine Belt |
| Mississippi | Amite, Pike, Walthall, Lincoln, Lawrence, Jefferson Davis, Covington, Jones, Wayne, Greene | ~240,000 | SW Mississippi |
| **Total** | **~34 counties** | **~1.07 million (core)** | Broader region ~3M |

### Why This Constitutes a Region

The Piney Woods share characteristics that state boundaries obscure:

**Shared Economic History.** Timber extraction built these communities. Lumber companies arrived in the late 1800s, established company towns, clearcut virgin forest, and departed. Unlike Appalachian coal that employed multiple generations, **timber extraction was rapid**: most old growth was gone by 1930. Communities that timber built faced abandonment within a generation of their founding.

**Oil Overlay.** The East Texas Oil Field, discovered in 1930, brought boom then bust. Oil extraction created pockets of temporary prosperity without building permanent economic infrastructure. When wells depleted, communities had neither timber nor oil.

**Demographic Mix.** Unlike the predominantly Black Delta or predominantly white Appalachia, the Piney Woods contain **mixed demographics**: majority Black counties in Louisiana and Mississippi, majority white counties in Texas, and significant Hispanic populations throughout. This diversity shapes community dynamics and healthcare access patterns.

**Cultural Distinctiveness.** Piney Woods communities developed cultural patterns distinct from both Delta cotton culture and coastal Louisiana Cajun culture. Logging camps, small farms, and hunting traditions created identities tied to forest rather than river or coast.

## Historical Context

### The Timber Economy

The Piney Woods were **America's first industrial forestry region**. When northern forests depleted, timber companies moved south. Railroads penetrated pine forests in the 1880s and 1890s, enabling extraction at industrial scale.

**Timber Extraction Timeline:**

| Period | Activity | Impact |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1880-1900 | Railroad construction | Access to virgin timber |
| 1890-1920 | Peak extraction | Company towns, sawmill employment |
| 1920-1940 | Forest depletion | Mill closures, population decline |
| 1940-1980 | Reforestation | Managed timber, reduced employment |
| 1980-Present | Consolidation | Fewer jobs, remaining communities stable or declining |

Company towns in the Piney Woods followed the **same pattern as Appalachian coal towns**: company housing, company stores, company services. When the mill closed, the town had no economic base. Some became ghost towns. Others survived on reduced circumstances.

The difference from Appalachia was **speed**. Coal extraction continued for generations, creating multi-generational communities with deep roots. Timber extraction lasted one generation in most areas. Communities barely established before the economic base disappeared.

### Oil and After

The **1930 East Texas Oil Field discovery** brought a second extraction boom to portions of the region. Kilgore, Longview, and Tyler grew rapidly. Smaller communities experienced temporary prosperity. But oil, like timber, was extractive: wealth exported, local communities left with depletion.

The oil economy added **boom-bust volatility** to timber decline. Communities learned to distrust prosperity as temporary. Boom brought population influx, demand for services, then bust brought collapse. This cycle repeated through the 1980s oil crash and subsequent market fluctuations.

### Policy Absence

Throughout this history, the Piney Woods received **no federal regional designation**. The Appalachian Regional Commission (1965) recognized Appalachian distinctiveness. The Delta Regional Authority (2000) recognized Delta crisis. No equivalent recognized Piney Woods challenges.

Why not? Several factors contributed:

**Cross-State Fragmentation.** The region spans three states with different political orientations. Texas identified with western expansion, not southern poverty programs. Louisiana focused on New Orleans and coastal issues. Mississippi concentrated federal attention on the Delta.

**Lack of Organized Advocacy.** No regional institution emerged to advocate for Piney Woods recognition. Without a champion, the region remained invisible.

**Racial Complexity.** The Piney Woods' mixed demographics fit neither the Delta's Black poverty narrative nor Appalachia's white poverty narrative. Advocacy organizations organized around race could not easily mobilize a mixed region.

## Current Conditions

### Health Outcomes

Piney Woods counties rank among the worst in their respective states, though state-level analysis obscures regional patterns.

**Health Outcome Comparisons:**

| Measure | Piney Woods Average | Texas Rural | Louisiana Rural | Mississippi Rural |
|---------|---------------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Life Expectancy | 73.8 years | 76.2 years | 74.1 years | 72.4 years |
| Premature Death (per 100K) | 9,800 | 7,900 | 10,400 | 11,200 |
| Diabetes Prevalence | 14.2% | 10.8% | 13.1% | 14.8% |
| Adult Obesity | 38.4% | 33.1% | 36.2% | 39.4% |
| Adult Smoking | 22.1% | 14.2% | 20.8% | 21.3% |

The data reveal that **Piney Woods Texas counties have outcomes closer to Louisiana and Mississippi** than to Texas overall. State averages mask this regional pattern. Texas RHTP planning that treats all rural Texas equivalently misses Piney Woods severity.

### Healthcare Infrastructure

Infrastructure has contracted as timber and oil economies declined.

**Facility Distribution:**

| Facility Type | Texas Piney Woods | LA Piney Woods | MS Piney Woods | Trend |
|---------------|-------------------|----------------|----------------|-------|
| Hospitals | 8 | 5 | 3 | -4 since 2015 |
| FQHCs | 12 | 8 | 6 | Growing |
| RHCs | 24 | 18 | 11 | Stable |
| CAHs | 4 | 3 | 2 | -2 since 2015 |

**Hospital closures** have hit the region hard. Texas lost **21 rural hospitals** statewide since 2010, with Deep East Texas bearing disproportionate losses. The pattern follows familiar arithmetic: Medicare and Medicaid pay below cost, commercial insurance patients migrate to urban facilities, uncompensated care rises, closure becomes inevitable.

### Workforce

Provider shortages pervade the region, with recruitment challenges that compound over time.

**Workforce Indicators:**

| Measure | Piney Woods | National Rural | Gap |
|---------|-------------|----------------|-----|
| PCPs per 100K | 41 | 68 | -27 |
| Mental Health per 100K | 52 | 128 | -76 |
| Dentists per 100K | 26 | 42 | -16 |
| HPSA Primary Care | 89% of counties | 62% of counties | +27% |

The **mental health gap** is particularly severe. Substance use disorder, depression, and anxiety pervade the region, but treatment capacity barely exists. Counties with 15,000 residents may have no mental health providers.

## Living in the Piney Woods

*Kayla Hernandez grew up in Jasper, Texas, left for nursing school at Stephen F. Austin State University, and returned to work at the clinic where she had been a patient. Now the clinic director, she navigates between two worlds: the Piney Woods she loves and the policy world that sees only deficits.*

*When funders visit, they see poverty statistics. They see health rankings in the bottom quartile. They see closure risk indicators flashing red. They write grants framing Jasper as a problem to be solved.*

*Kayla sees something different. She sees the hunting camp where three generations gather each November. She sees the church that provided meals when the mill closed in 1992. She sees the volunteer fire department that pulled her uncle from a wrecked truck on Highway 96. She sees community.*

*"They come in asking what's wrong," she tells her staff. "Nobody asks what's right. We've been here for a hundred years. Our grandparents survived the Depression, the mill closing, the oil bust. We know how to take care of each other. We just need resources, not rescue."*

*The clinic operates on grants written in deficit language because that is what funding requires. The strategic plan emphasizes problems because that is what reviewers expect. Every application describes crisis because crisis unlocks dollars. The community's strengths, invisible to funders, sustain people through challenges that grants alone cannot address.*

*"I write about how bad things are because that's how you get money," Kayla admits. "Then I work every day with people who are proud of this place, who chose to stay, who help their neighbors. There's a gap between what I write and what I see. I just hope the money helps without making people feel like they're broken."*

## The Core Tension

### Regional Identity vs. External Characterization

The **regional identity view** emphasizes community self-understanding. Piney Woods residents know their communities intimately. They understand local institutions, informal networks, cultural patterns, and community strengths. External characterization as "distressed rural area" or "health crisis zone" reduces lived communities to deficit categories. Transformation should engage with how communities understand themselves, not with how outsiders categorize them.

Proponents note that **externally-designed programs routinely fail** in communities that reject the framing those programs embody. Appalachian War on Poverty programs often missed because they treated communities as deficient rather than different. Programs that respect community identity can work with existing institutions and relationships. Programs that impose deficit narratives alienate the communities they claim to serve.

The **analytical necessity view** argues that external perspective provides clarity communities may lack. Residents may normalize conditions that are not normal. "That's just how it is" accepts preventable suffering. Accurate characterization, even if uncomfortable, is necessary for effective intervention. Romanticizing regional identity while outcomes remain poor excuses system failure.

Proponents note that **structural causes of health crisis may not be visible from inside**. Communities adapting to crisis develop coping mechanisms that obscure structural dysfunction. External analysis identifies patterns that local perspective misses. Transformation requires honest assessment of what is wrong, not just celebration of what is right.

**Evidence Assessment:**

The evidence suggests **both perspectives capture partial truth**, but implementation requires hierarchy. Community identity is real and consequential. Programs that dismiss community identity fail. But community identity can also normalize dysfunction. The honest resolution is: **lead with respect for community identity while addressing structural barriers that community identity alone cannot resolve**.

Practically, this means transformation should:

1. Engage communities as partners, not problems
2. Build on existing institutions rather than creating parallel structures  
3. Hire from within communities, not parachuting outsiders
4. Acknowledge community strengths in program design
5. Address structural barriers that communities cannot address alone
6. Measure success by community-defined outcomes, not just external metrics

## Alternative Perspective: The Regional Romanticism Critique

The **regional romanticism critique** argues that celebrating Piney Woods identity risks excusing system failure. Pride in place, resilience narratives, and community strength stories can become reasons not to invest. "They're resilient" becomes code for "they don't need services." Romanticizing regional culture while conditions remain poor provides cover for abandonment.

**Strongest Version:** Regional identity narratives serve external interests by justifying neglect. Every celebration of community resilience is an implicit argument against structural investment. If communities can survive on their own strengths, why invest in transformation? Romanticism and disinvestment work together: romanticize what communities have while withholding what they need.

**Counter-Assessment:** The critique identifies real danger but overcorrects. The alternative to romanticism is not deficit framing but honest assessment. Communities have real strengths and real needs. Transformation should acknowledge both without reducing either to the other. The evidence does not support the claim that recognizing strengths undermines investment, but it does support caution against strength narratives that substitute for structural intervention.

**Where This Leads:** The Piney Woods warrant investment not because communities are deficient but because structural barriers limit community possibility. Investment should enhance community capacity, not replace it. This framing respects identity while addressing need.

## What State-Level Analysis Misses

### The Texas Blind Spot

Texas RHTP planning treats rural Texas as a category. But **Deep East Texas has more in common with rural Louisiana** than with the Texas Panhandle or Hill Country. State-level analysis that averages across regions misses severity concentration.

Texas RHTP allocation of approximately **$281 million** must serve 4.2 million rural Texans across dramatically different regions. Without regional targeting, Deep East Texas Piney Woods may receive investment proportional to population rather than proportional to need.

### The Louisiana Gap

Louisiana focuses RHTP attention on the Delta and coastal restoration. The northern pine belt receives **less policy attention** than either crisis zone. Louisiana's approximately **$128 million** RHTP award must address multiple regional challenges, with no mechanism prioritizing the Piney Woods.

### The Mississippi Overlap

Southwestern Mississippi Piney Woods counties share challenges with the Delta but receive less attention. Mississippi's RHTP focus on Delta counties, while justified by severity, leaves Piney Woods counties in policy shadow.

### The Cross-State Opportunity

The Piney Woods present an opportunity for **interstate coordination** that current RHTP structure does not require. If Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi recognized the Piney Woods as a region, they could:

1. Coordinate workforce recruitment across state lines
2. Develop shared telehealth infrastructure
3. Align community health worker training and certification
4. Share data on regional health patterns
5. Present a unified regional voice in federal policy

Nothing in current RHTP structure prevents this coordination. Nothing requires it. Without external pressure, three separate state administrations will address Piney Woods counties separately.

## When Recognition Arrives

*The University of Texas Health Science Center at Tyler operates a regional campus that serves Deep East Texas. Dr. Vanessa Morgan directs community engagement, working with counties that rarely see academic medicine.*

*"We've been invisible for so long that some folks don't believe help is coming," she explains. "They've heard promises before. Federal programs came and went. Grants started and stopped. Why should this time be different?"*

*Dr. Morgan's team approaches communities differently. They don't lead with what's wrong. They lead with questions: What does this community need? What does it already have? What would help look like?*

*In San Augustine County, those questions revealed unexpected assets. The county has one physician but multiple churches with active health ministries. Community members identified church networks as the infrastructure for health improvement, not the clinic system that barely exists.*

*"We could design a program around clinics they don't have," Dr. Morgan says, "or we could build on churches they do have. Same goals, different strategy. One respects what they've built. The other ignores it."*

*The community health worker program that emerged trains church members as health navigators. It reaches people who would never visit a clinic. It builds on relationships that already exist. It costs less than importing professionals and works better because it works with community rather than on community.*

*"This is what regional transformation could look like," Dr. Morgan reflects. "Not outsiders solving problems, but outsiders supporting what communities already do. The Piney Woods have survived a hundred years of being ignored. They have something. We just need to see it."*

## RHTP Implications

### What RHTP Could Provide

1. **Regional recognition within state plans.** CMS could require states to identify sub-state regions and tailor strategies accordingly. Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi could acknowledge the Piney Woods as a region requiring specific attention.

2. **Interstate coordination incentives.** CMS could provide bonus funding for states that coordinate across shared regions. The three Piney Woods states could develop joint workforce, telehealth, and CHW initiatives.

3. **Identity-respecting metrics.** Performance measurement could include community-defined outcomes alongside standard metrics. Success could be measured by what communities value, not just what funders count.

4. **Asset-based implementation.** Guidance could require that state plans build on existing community institutions rather than creating parallel structures.

### What RHTP Cannot Provide

1. **Regional commission or authority.** Creating new governance structures is beyond program scope.

2. **Forced interstate coordination.** Coordination must be voluntary; CMS cannot require it.

3. **Economic development.** Healthcare investment alone cannot replace timber and oil economies that no longer sustain communities.

4. **Visibility parity with Delta or Appalachia.** The Piney Woods lack the policy infrastructure and advocacy organizations that those regions have built over decades.
