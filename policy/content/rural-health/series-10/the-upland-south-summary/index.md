The Upland South presents transformation challenges that infrastructure investment and funding cannot solve alone, requiring engagement with communities whose cultural identity includes resistance to the very programs designed to improve their health outcomes. This region, stretching from Virginia through the Carolinas, Tennessee, and Kentucky, encompasses approximately 8 to 10 million people unified not by extreme poverty but by historical tobacco economy, Scots-Irish cultural heritage, evangelical Protestant tradition, and small-farm agricultural structure that has undergone profound disruption since the 2004 tobacco buyout. Understanding this region requires recognizing that it occupies policy invisibility between Appalachia and the Delta, neither poor enough to demand crisis response nor geographically distinctive enough for dedicated federal programming, making it ordinary rural America that receives ordinary programming insufficient for its particular challenges.

The 2004 Fair and Equitable Tobacco Reform Act ended the quota system that sustained small tobacco farms for seven decades, providing nearly $10 billion in buyout payments distributed over ten years. The effects were predictable and severe. The number of farms growing tobacco nationally dropped from 56,977 in 2002 to only 2,987 by 2022, a 95% decline that reflects **massive agricultural consolidation** as production shifted to large mechanized operations once quotas no longer constrained scale. Kentucky alone dropped from approximately 24,000 tobacco farms to 984. The payment distribution was highly unequal, with an estimated 20% of growers receiving more than 75% of total payments, meaning the median payout of less than $15,000 annually for ten years proved **insufficient to sustain small farming operations** through transition to alternatives. Small farmers who needed transition assistance most received the least because they had the smallest quotas, highest production costs per pound, and fewest viable alternatives.

Two decades after the buyout, the Upland South remains in economic transition without clear destination. Manufacturing that might have absorbed displaced tobacco farmers has itself declined as textile mills closed and furniture factories moved offshore. Alternative agriculture succeeds in limited niches, with hay, cattle, and specialty crops unable to absorb all displaced farmers while requiring more acreage for equivalent returns. Tourism and amenity economies have transformed communities near metropolitan areas or with natural attractions, but most communities lack such assets. The dominant strategy has become commuting 30 to 90 minutes to employment in metropolitan areas or regional centers while maintaining rural residence, which **preserves residential population but transforms community character** as working-age adults remain absent during business hours. The net effect is communities that remain rural in geography and culture but lack the economic base that sustained them for generations, with healthcare challenges emerging against this backdrop of extended economic uncertainty.

Health outcomes reflect this convergence of cultural factors and economic stress. Adult smoking rates reach 22 to 28% compared to 14% nationally, remaining elevated in communities where growing tobacco was identity rather than merely livelihood. Diabetes prevalence reaches 14 to 16% compared to 10% nationally. Heart disease mortality reaches 220 to 260 per 100,000 compared to 165 nationally. These elevated rates reflect tobacco use, dietary patterns, limited healthcare access, and economic stress, but the cultural context explains patterns that statistics merely capture. Anti-smoking campaigns designed elsewhere face resistance when they appear to condemn communities' heritage. The same families who built their lives on tobacco continue using it at rates well above national averages, demonstrating how **economic transition does not automatically produce cultural transformation**.

The fundamental healthcare challenge facing the Upland South is trust rather than infrastructure. Evangelical Protestant churches anchor community life in ways that secular institutions cannot replicate, with ministers and deacons trusted while government officials are not. Government assistance carries stigma that accumulates across generations, with accepting help signaling failure to provide for oneself and family. Communities experiencing decades of outside characterization as backward or in need of rescue have developed protective suspicion toward academic researchers, government officials, and healthcare reformers arriving from distant cities. These orientations affect healthcare utilization even when coverage is available, as eligible individuals decline to enroll in programs rather than accept what they perceive as charity. Several Upland South states did not expand Medicaid under the ACA, with North Carolina expanding only in late 2023, Tennessee still refusing expansion, and Georgia expanding in 2024 with work requirements limiting enrollment. Even where marketplace coverage or Medicaid is available, enrollment rates lag because **subsidies represent government assistance and government assistance carries cultural stigma**.

The analytical challenge is holding two truths simultaneously. Communities have genuine strengths that transformation should engage, including remarkable mutual support through churches and extended family networks that provide care for elderly members, organize meal deliveries for the sick, and collect offerings for families facing medical emergencies. These bonds are real health assets. But communities also face genuine challenges requiring intervention, with high chronic disease rates and healthcare access barriers remaining real regardless of how communities see themselves. Accurate assessment, even when uncomfortable, is necessary for effective intervention. The goal is intervention respecting identity while improving outcomes, not choosing between respect and effectiveness. Pure self-determination may mean no transformation at all when communities lack healthcare expertise to design evidence-based programs, yet imposed transformation will be resisted and ultimately rejected given cultural patterns of distrust. The evidence suggests that **hybrid approaches work best**, with external resources supporting community-controlled implementation through programs designed with genuine input, implemented through trusted institutions, and accountable to community members.

Churches and faith communities present both the greatest opportunity and the most complex boundary questions. Ministers have moral authority that public health officials lack, and effective transformation might engage churches as partners extending healthcare through trusted community anchors. Health ministries, church-based health fairs, and congregation-based programming reach populations that secular programs miss. But partnership requires careful attention to church-state boundaries, inclusion of all community members regardless of religious participation, and ensuring that theological commitments do not affect care delivery in ways creating disparities. The evidence suggests that appropriately structured partnership with faith communities can improve outcomes, but **religious participation cannot become a condition of healthcare access** even as religious institutions become healthcare partners.

State RHTP engagement reflects varying degrees of explicit recognition for tobacco-transition communities. Virginia identifies Southside as a priority region and proposes workforce investment targeting the area, though specific engagement strategies for communities resistant to government programs remain underdeveloped. North Carolina's late 2023 Medicaid expansion improved coverage options, and the NC ROOTS regional hub model creates coordination infrastructure that could support community-engaged approaches, though explicit strategies for faith community partnership remain to be developed. Tennessee's continued non-expansion creates fundamental coverage gaps affecting Middle and East Tennessee tobacco country, with transformation capacity limited when underlying coverage infrastructure is absent. Kentucky expanded Medicaid in 2014, providing coverage foundation other Upland South states lack, though Eastern Kentucky Appalachian focus dominates state planning with central Kentucky tobacco country receiving less explicit attention.

Effective transformation in the Upland South requires approaches that standard program design does not typically provide. Investment should flow through community institutions wherever possible, engaging agricultural extension services with longstanding community relationships, volunteer fire and rescue services providing emergency response, and schools reaching children and families who might not otherwise engage healthcare systems. Community health workers must be recruited from the communities they serve because a neighbor discussing diabetes management has credibility that visiting specialists lack. Programs must demonstrate long-term commitment over years rather than disappearing after grant cycles, which confirms suspicions that outside attention is temporary and self-interested. Providers must approach communities as learners rather than experts with answers, acknowledging that communities have knowledge and values deserving respect. Transformation metrics expecting rapid improvement will show failure where appropriate expectations recognize that **changing community health patterns requires years, not program cycles**.

What transformation cannot achieve warrants equal attention. Trust deficits built over generations cannot be overcome in program cycles, as communities will not suddenly embrace outside programs because funding appeared. RHTP runs through 2030, and four years is insufficient for trust transformation in communities with deep suspicion. Programs communities do not want will not succeed regardless of evidence for effectiveness, and transformation cannot change fundamental cultural orientation toward government among communities viewing government programs as threats. Healthcare transformation cannot restore the economic stability that tobacco provided or fill the void that economic transition created. The fifth-generation farmer with diabetes and no insurance who would view accepting government healthcare as admitting defeat represents the transformation challenge in human form. He needs healthcare but is unlikely to accept healthcare offered as government assistance. Reaching him requires understanding his worldview, engaging his community, working through his church, and respecting his values even when those values complicate healthcare delivery. Whether RHTP can accomplish this within program timelines and structures remains the open question that will determine whether $50 billion in transformation investment produces commensurate outcomes in communities where cultural engagement matters more than infrastructure alone.
