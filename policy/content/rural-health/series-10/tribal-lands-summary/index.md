The Rural Health Transformation Program allocates $50 billion through state governments to transform rural healthcare while $911 billion in simultaneous Medicaid cuts proceed. For the 4.1 million American Indians and Alaska Natives living on 326 federally recognized reservations spanning 56 million acres across 36 states, this architecture creates a fundamental contradiction. Tribal nations are **sovereign governments with treaty-based healthcare rights**, not demographic subgroups within state populations. Yet RHTP channels all funding through states, requiring sovereign nations to receive federal healthcare dollars mediated by state governments that historically excluded, displaced, and actively harmed their populations.

The Navajo Nation illustrates the problem's scope. Spanning 27,413 square miles across Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah (larger than West Virginia), it operates its own government, court system, police force, and healthcare system. When CMS announced RHTP allocations in December 2025, Arizona received $168.2 million, New Mexico received $132.8 million, and Utah received its allocation. The Navajo Nation, a sovereign government responsible for healthcare across three states, received nothing directly. Estimates suggest perhaps $25 million of Arizona's allocation, $18 million of New Mexico's, and smaller Utah amounts might reach Navajo populations, totaling roughly $84 per Navajo resident. These are state discretionary decisions, not tribal entitlements.

This structural mismatch between state administration and tribal sovereignty determines transformation possibilities for populations experiencing the most severe health disparities in the nation. American Indians and Alaska Natives face **life expectancy 12.3 years below the national average**, the widest gap for any population group. Diabetes prevalence runs 14.7 percent compared to 10.5 percent nationally. Suicide rates reach 23.9 per 100,000 compared to 14.5 nationally. Infant mortality exceeds national rates by 2.8 deaths per 1,000 births. These disparities reflect accumulated impacts of chronic underfunding, not lack of healthcare system capacity or tribal governance failure.

The federal government's trust responsibility for tribal healthcare derives from treaties that ceded millions of acres in exchange for federal obligations including healthcare. This represents **payment for land, not charity or discretionary programming**. The Supreme Court has repeatedly affirmed that trust responsibility constitutes legal obligation. The Indian Health Service, established in 1955 when healthcare responsibility transferred from the Bureau of Indian Affairs to the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, operationalizes this trust responsibility through direct service facilities, tribally-operated facilities under 638 contracting, and Urban Indian Health Programs serving the 70 percent of American Indians and Alaska Natives living in urban areas.

IHS per-capita spending consistently runs 40 to 60 percent below federal spending for Medicare beneficiaries, Medicaid recipients, and federal employees. The FY2026 IHS budget of approximately $7.8 billion serves 2.7 million users at IHS and tribal facilities, yielding per-capita funding around $4,100 compared to Medicare's $14,000 and federal employee health benefits' $7,500. This funding gap represents **accumulated underfunding totaling tens of billions of dollars** that RHTP's state-mediated allocations cannot address.

The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975 (Public Law 93-638) transformed tribal healthcare by enabling tribes to assume operation of IHS facilities and programs. Under 638 contracting, tribes receive federal funding to operate their own healthcare systems rather than receiving care from federal employees in federal facilities. Approximately 60 percent of IHS funding now flows through tribal 638 contracts. Tribally-operated facilities consistently achieve better outcomes, higher patient satisfaction, and greater cultural appropriateness than directly-operated IHS facilities, demonstrating that **tribal self-determination and healthcare quality align** rather than conflict.

The Cherokee Nation Health Services provides the success story that reveals RHTP's architectural failure. Serving over 400,000 tribal citizens across northeastern Oklahoma, the system includes W.W. Hastings Hospital in Tahlequah, eight outpatient health centers, and comprehensive behavioral health services. Since assuming operation of its IHS facilities under 638 contracting in 1990, Cherokee Nation has expanded services, improved outcomes, and achieved patient satisfaction scores exceeding most regional health systems. The system coordinates with Oklahoma Medicaid, commercial insurers, and IHS to maximize resources from all available streams while maintaining tribal control over system design and priorities.

Cherokee Nation operates within Oklahoma, a single-state jurisdiction, enabling coherent transformation strategy. The Navajo Nation, with comparable population, must navigate three states with three Medicaid programs, three RHTP allocations, and three state bureaucracies that address Navajo health separately as if state boundaries matter to a nation whose territory predates those states by centuries. A Navajo patient in Shiprock, New Mexico receives primary care at Northern Navajo Medical Center, an IHS hospital. Her specialists practice in Farmington, New Mexico. Cardiac catheterization requires travel to Albuquerque, 180 miles away. Her nephew in Chinle, Arizona on the same reservation receives primary care at Chinle Comprehensive Health Care Facility, also IHS, but his specialists are in Flagstaff or Phoenix. Same nation, different state, **different referral networks that state-level RHTP planning cannot coordinate**.

No state RHTP application addresses tribal nations as sovereign governments. Tribal populations appear as demographics to serve, not as partners in transformation design. Tribal consultation, where it occurred, involved soliciting input rather than sharing authority. The applications treat tribes as stakeholders rather than as governments with superior claim to federal healthcare resources under treaty obligations that predate state governments. Arizona's application mentions tribal populations; New Mexico's application acknowledges consultation; Oklahoma's application references tribal jurisdictions following McGirt v. Oklahoma (2020). None propose **direct tribal authority over RHTP resources** or multi-state coordination mechanisms for nations spanning state boundaries.

Direct federal-tribal RHTP pathways would require Congressional authorization for tribal set-aside or direct application pathways, tribal application processes parallel to state processes, CMS tribal liaison capacity for implementation support, coordination requirements between state and tribal RHTP programs, and multi-state tribal provisions for nations spanning state boundaries. None of these requirements are insurmountable. The IHS 638 contracting model provides precedent. CMS has tribal consultation requirements for Medicaid. The Affordable Care Act included tribal provisions that RHTP could have replicated but conspicuously did not.

Some analysts argue that tribal healthcare cannot succeed in isolation and that integration with state and regional systems is necessary for sustainable transformation regardless of sovereignty concerns. The strongest version holds that tribal populations use non-tribal healthcare systems extensively, Medicaid is the largest payer for IHS and tribal facilities, emergency care happens at the nearest facility regardless of jurisdiction, and specialty care requires referral to non-tribal systems. Integration is reality; policy should facilitate rather than resist it. Separate tribal RHTP pathways would fragment healthcare systems that function through integration.

This argument correctly identifies integration reality but draws incorrect policy conclusions. Tribal members use non-tribal systems because **tribal systems are inadequately funded**, not because integration is inherently superior. With adequate resources, tribal systems could provide more services internally. Integration occurs because of scarcity, not preference. Moreover, integration can occur within tribal-led frameworks. Cherokee Nation coordinates with Oklahoma Medicaid while maintaining tribal system control. Navajo Nation partners with Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah health systems while operating its own facilities. Integration and sovereignty are not opposites. Tribal-led integration differs fundamentally from state-administered integration that subordinates tribal authority.

The evidence on tribal healthcare governance is unambiguous. Tribally-operated healthcare systems consistently outperform IHS direct service and dramatically outperform state-administered programs serving comparable populations. The Alaska Native tribal health system, the Cherokee Nation health system, and other tribal systems demonstrate that **tribal self-determination produces better outcomes, not worse**. RHTP's state administration structure contradicts this evidence. Direct federal-tribal RHTP pathways would align program architecture with demonstrated effectiveness. State-mediated funding reverses the relationship, making tribal nations subordinate to state governments in violation of their sovereign status and contrary to evidence about what produces healthcare improvement.

Healthcare workforce shortages on tribal lands exceed shortages elsewhere. IHS vacancy rates run approximately 25 percent for physicians and higher for specialists. Remote reservations compete against the entire national healthcare market for providers, offering lower compensation, challenging conditions, and limited amenities. The Community Health Representative program provides community-based workers who deliver health education, navigation, and basic services. CHRs are the tribal equivalent of community health workers, employed by tribes rather than healthcare facilities. The model works where funded but remains chronically underfunded relative to need and transformation potential.

Tribal communities possess resources that transformation could build upon if architecture permitted. Tribal governance capacity exists and functions; tribes operate governments, health systems, enterprises, and programs demonstrating capacity for self-determined transformation where resources are provided. Cultural frameworks for health and wellness that predate Western medicine provide foundations for
