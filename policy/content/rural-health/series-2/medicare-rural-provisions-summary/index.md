Medicare provides the financial foundation upon which rural health infrastructure either stands or collapses. In 2023, Medicare and Medicaid combined covered 72% of rural hospital inpatient discharges, with Medicare constituting an even larger share due to the older demographic profile of rural populations. When Medicare payment policies change, rural hospitals feel the effects immediately and intensely. Congress recognized this dependence decades ago and created special payment provisions designed to preserve rural healthcare access, but these provisions face constant political pressure and do not guarantee viability. The Rural Health Transformation Program must build upon this Medicare foundation while confronting the reality that the foundation itself is neither stable nor sufficient.

**Critical Access Hospitals receive cost-based reimbursement** at 101% of allowable costs for inpatient, outpatient, and swing-bed services. This designation emerged from crisis after more than 400 rural hospitals closed during the 1980s and early 1990s, when small facilities could not survive under Medicare's prospective payment system. As of April 2025, 1,377 Critical Access Hospitals operate across the United States, representing the majority of small rural hospitals. To qualify, facilities must meet geographic requirements (located more than 35 miles from another hospital, or 15 miles in mountainous terrain), size limitations (25 inpatient beds for acute care), length of stay requirements (96-hour annual average), and emergency service requirements (24/7 capability). However, **cost-based payment is not cost-plus payment**. Medicare pays 101% of "reasonable and allowable costs" as determined through cost report settlement, not whatever costs a CAH incurs. Federal budget sequestration has reduced effective payment to approximately 99% of allowable costs since 2013. Moreover, coinsurance burdens fall heavily on patients because beneficiaries pay coinsurance based on hospital charges rather than costs, potentially facing 40-60% of actual costs rather than the standard 20%. The Flex Monitoring Team's 2024 analysis showed total margins for rural CAHs ranging from negative 20.5% to positive 28.0%, and one-third of rural hospital closures over the past decade involved Critical Access Hospitals. Cost-based payment helps but cannot solve fundamental viability problems when total patient volume is inadequate or when non-Medicare payers do not provide comparable reimbursement.

The Rural Emergency Hospital designation, created by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 and effective January 1, 2023, represents the first new rural provider type since CAHs in 1997. REHs address what happens when a rural hospital cannot sustain inpatient services but the community still needs emergency and outpatient care. As of October 2025, 42 facilities have converted to REH status, though over 1,500 hospitals were initially eligible. REHs cannot provide inpatient services except for post-hospital extended care in a distinct part skilled nursing facility unit, but they must provide 24/7 emergency services and may provide observation care up to 24 hours plus other outpatient services. The payment structure includes two components: outpatient services receive 105% of Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System rates, and **monthly facility payments provide baseline revenue regardless of volume**. For 2025, each REH receives $285,625.90 per month, totaling approximately $3.4 million annually, uniform across all REHs regardless of size, location, or service volume. Despite these financial incentives, conversion faces significant barriers including community resistance to losing inpatient services, loss of swing bed revenue and service capability, 340B program revenue loss for participating CAHs, and financial modeling uncertainty given the designation's novelty. Analysis of first-year conversions revealed that twenty percent of U.S. states have not expanded Medicaid but these states account for approximately 66% of REH conversions, suggesting hospitals in non-expansion states face greater financial pressure requiring the REH lifeline.

Sole Community Hospitals and Medicare Dependent Hospitals operate under the Inpatient Prospective Payment System but receive enhanced payments to address rural financial pressures. SCH designation applies to hospitals that are geographically isolated and serve as the sole source of inpatient services reasonably available to Medicare beneficiaries in their area, located more than 35 miles from other like hospitals or meeting alternative distance and market share criteria. SCHs receive payment protections based on a historical cost baseline, with Medicare paying the higher of the federal PPS rate or a hospital-specific rate derived from historical costs. MDH designation applies to small rural hospitals heavily dependent on Medicare revenue (rural location, no more than 100 beds, at least 60% of inpatient days or discharges attributable to Medicare beneficiaries), with hospitals receiving 75% of the difference between the federal rate and their hospital-specific rate. However, **MDH enhanced payments and low-volume hospital adjustments face expiration on September 30, 2025**. Congress has repeatedly extended these programs, but each renewal requires legislative action. Without extensions, CMS estimates affected hospitals would lose approximately $500 million in annual payments, potentially representing the difference between viability and closure for individual facilities.

Rural Health Clinics provide primary care services in rural areas designated as medically underserved or Health Professional Shortage Areas, with more than 5,700 RHCs operating across the United States as of October 2025. Medicare pays RHCs through an All-Inclusive Rate that bundles payment for a covered visit regardless of specific services provided, with the 2025 AIR payment limit at $152 per visit for independent RHCs and provider-based RHCs in hospitals with 50 or more beds. Provider-based RHCs in smaller hospitals may receive higher rates if their historical costs exceeded current limits, a distinction that matters for RHTP planning when hospitals consider RHC development.

**Medicare Advantage enrollment in rural areas grew from 400,000 beneficiaries in 2010 to more than 1.8 million in 2023**, a fourfold increase with profound implications for rural hospitals that depend on Medicare cost-based and enhanced payments. MA plans are not required to pay cost-based rates, negotiating reimbursement like commercial payers and eliminating the financial protections that Medicare fee-for-service provides. MA plans reimburse rural providers an average of 10% less than traditional Medicare relative to costs according to a February 2025 AHA report, with Medicare Dependent Hospitals and Low-Volume Hospitals receiving 15% less from MA plans than from traditional Medicare. Industry benchmark data shows MA plans paying CAHs only 95% of traditional Medicare rates, effectively undermining the cost-based reimbursement that justifies CAH status. Limited competition among MA plans in rural markets (areas may have only one or two MA plan options) weakens hospital bargaining power, and MA plans impose administrative requirements that strain rural hospital resources through prior authorization burdens, discharge delays (MA patients stay nearly 10% longer in rural hospitals than clinically similar traditional Medicare patients), and network adequacy gaps.

Telehealth provisions expanded rapidly during the COVID-19 public health emergency, eliminating geographic restrictions, waiving originating site requirements, and allowing audio-only services for certain conditions. **Temporary provisions require congressional reauthorization**, and without legislative action, many telehealth flexibilities will expire on December 31, 2025. Certain provisions specific to rural areas are permanent or have longer authorizations (CAHs may serve as telehealth originating sites, mental health telehealth received expanded permanent coverage), but RHTP telehealth infrastructure investments depend on continued Medicare coverage of telehealth services at rates adequate to sustain operations. The program can fund equipment and connectivity, but providers need ongoing reimbursement to sustain telehealth operations, meaning congressional failure to extend telehealth flexibilities would undermine transformation investments in this area.

RHTP transformation activities operate on top of the Medicare foundation, providing one-time investments to strengthen infrastructure that Medicare payments must subsequently sustain. Successful implementation requires understanding how transformation investments interact with Medicare payment. Workforce investments may increase hospital costs that Medicare will cover under CAH cost-based methodology only if allowable; telehealth infrastructure generates revenue only if Medicare covers telehealth services at adequate rates; care coordination improvements may reduce hospitalizations, which benefits providers under value-based arrangements but reduces revenue under fee-for-service. States and hospitals should consider Medicare designation strategy as part of RHTP planning, recognizing that CAH conversion may benefit PPS hospitals struggling with low volumes and high Medicare shares, REH conversion may suit facilities that cannot sustain inpatient services, or maintaining existing designations may be optimal where current provisions provide adequate support. RHTP applications typically assume continued Medicare payment at current levels, but **this assumption may not hold**. Per capita cap implementation, MA payment shortfalls, sequestration, and potential changes to cost-based reimbursement could all reduce Medicare revenue below projected levels.

The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission periodically examines rural payment provisions and has questioned whether cost-based reimbursement remains appropriate for all CAHs
