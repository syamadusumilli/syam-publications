This technical document details the **funding formula methodology** for the Rural Health Transformation Program (RHTP) as established under Section 71401 of Public Law 119-21 (One Big Beautiful Bill Act), signed July 4, 2025. All data presented reflects verified sources from the **CMS December 29, 2025 award announcement** and supporting federal documentation.

## Program Parameters

| Parameter | Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| **Total Authorization** | $50 billion | P.L. 119-21 Section 71401 |
| **Annual Allocation** | $10 billion | CMS Press Release 12/29/25 |
| **Program Duration** | FY2026 through FY2030 | CMS NOFO |
| **Budget Period 1** | December 31, 2025 through September 30, 2026 | U.S. Chamber FAQ |
| **Eligible Applicants** | 50 U.S. States only | P.L. 119-21 |
| **Ineligible Entities** | District of Columbia, U.S. Territories | CMS NOFO |

## Two-Part Allocation Formula

RHTP funding follows a **statutory two-part formula** as directed by Public Law 119-21.

### Component 1: Baseline Funding (50%)

**$5 billion annually** distributed equally among all 50 states with approved applications.

**FY2026 Baseline per State**: $100,000,000

This component provides each state with a **guaranteed funding floor** regardless of rural population size, health system metrics, or application quality. All 50 states received approval, resulting in equal $100 million baseline awards for FY2026.

**Source**: Hall Render legal analysis (January 6, 2026), CMS Press Release (December 29, 2025)

### Component 2: Workload Funding (50%)

**$5 billion annually** allocated by CMS based on multiple factors outlined in the Notice of Funding Opportunity.

**FY2026 Workload Funding Range**: $47,250,806 to $181,319,361

**Allocation Factors** (per CMS NOFO):

**State Need Metrics**
- Rural population residing within metropolitan statistical areas
- State's percentage of total national rural health facilities
- Proportion of hospitals receiving Medicaid DSH payments
- Land area calculations
- Population density thresholds

**Application Quality Factors**
- Technical quality of transformation plan
- MAHA policy alignment (SNAP restrictions, Presidential Fitness Test commitments)
- Stakeholder engagement documentation
- Prior rural health program performance
