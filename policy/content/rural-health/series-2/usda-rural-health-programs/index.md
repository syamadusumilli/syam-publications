> *"The Department of Agriculture as unexpected rural health actor. Infrastructure, broadband, and food systems shaping health outcomes in ways most applicants never consider."*

## Introduction

The U.S. Department of Agriculture operates rural health programs that predate the Rural Health Transformation Program by decades. These programs receive minimal attention in rural health policy discussions despite funding levels and reach that rival HRSA programs in scope.

**USDA administers over $3 billion annually in programs directly affecting rural health infrastructure.** This includes telehealth equipment grants, hospital construction loans, broadband deployment funding, and nutrition assistance that shapes dietary patterns across rural America. The programs exist because USDA's core mission of supporting rural communities extends beyond agriculture into the fabric of rural life itself.

The agency structure explains the invisibility. USDA Rural Development operates through state offices disconnected from health department planning processes. Rural hospital administrators rarely consider USDA when seeking capital financing. State Health Transformation Plans submitted under RHTP frequently omit reference to USDA programs that could complement or extend their initiatives.

This oversight represents missed opportunity. USDA programs can fund infrastructure that RHTP cannot directly support. Broadband deployment enables telehealth initiatives. Community Facilities financing can construct buildings that RHTP funds equip. Understanding these complementarities requires mapping programs that health policy analysts rarely examine.

## Distance Learning and Telemedicine Program

The **Distance Learning and Telemedicine (DLT) Program** provides competitive grants for equipment and technology that enable rural telehealth services. The program has operated since 1994 through the Rural Utilities Service within USDA Rural Development.

### Program Structure

DLT grants fund acquisition of telehealth equipment, not construction of broadband infrastructure. The distinction matters: hospitals seeking network connectivity look elsewhere, while those needing video conferencing systems, diagnostic equipment, or patient monitoring devices find DLT funding precisely matched to their needs.

**Eligible applicants** include healthcare providers, educational institutions, tribal entities, and organizations serving rural populations of 20,000 or fewer. The program explicitly targets end user equipment rather than backbone infrastructure.

Grant amounts range from **$50,000 to $1 million** with a three year performance period. The 15% matching requirement can be met through cash or in kind contributions, though vendor donated equipment contingent on subsequent purchases does not qualify. Communities in socially vulnerable areas face no matching requirement.

### Funding Reality

The FY2025 funding notice estimates **$40 million available** for competitive awards. This represents decades of relatively stable appropriations that have not kept pace with demand or technological change.

Applications routinely exceed available funding by factors of three or four. The March 2025 application deadline for FY2025 awards means projects selected will begin operations in late September 2025. Healthcare organizations planning telehealth expansion under RHTP can coordinate DLT applications to acquire equipment while RHTP funds operational costs.

### Healthcare Applications

DLT grants have supported **telemedicine equipment** for specialty consultations between rural clinics and urban specialists, **remote patient monitoring systems** for chronic disease management, **behavioral health platforms** for substance use disorder treatment, and **educational technology** for clinical training in underserved areas.

The 2018 Farm Bill mandated that **20% of DLT funding** be set aside for telemedicine projects addressing substance use disorders through FY2025. This priority aligned USDA telehealth investment with the rural opioid crisis.

### Limitations

DLT does not fund broadband infrastructure construction. Rural health systems with inadequate connectivity cannot use DLT grants to build networks, only to acquire equipment that requires networks to function. This creates coordination challenges: equipment arrives before connectivity exists, or connectivity improves after equipment budgets exhaust.

The program also excludes operational costs. Staffing, maintenance, software licensing, and ongoing technical support fall outside grant scope. Organizations receiving DLT awards must identify separate funding streams for sustainability.

## Community Facilities Programs

USDA Community Facilities Programs fund construction, renovation, and equipment for essential community infrastructure including healthcare facilities. From FY2015 to FY2024, Congress appropriated approximately **$2 billion** for these programs, with healthcare projects receiving priority consideration.

### Direct Loans

The **Community Facilities Direct Loan Program** provides below market interest rate financing for essential community facilities in rural areas with populations under 20,000.

**Eligible healthcare projects** include hospitals and medical clinics, dental clinics and specialty care facilities, nursing homes and assisted living facilities, emergency medical service stations, and rehabilitation centers.

Interest rates vary based on median household income and population of the service area. Loan terms extend up to 40 years or the useful life of the facility. For FY2024, Congress appropriated loan authority supporting **$2.8 billion** in direct loans.

The 2018 Farm Bill added **hospital debt refinancing** to eligible uses. Where refinancing would preserve rural access to health services and meaningfully improve hospital financial position, USDA can assist facilities restructuring existing obligations. This provision targeted rural hospitals facing closure from accumulated debt burdens.

### Grants

Community Facilities grants cover portions of project costs based on community characteristics. Maximum grant coverage follows a graduated scale:

| Community Profile | Maximum Grant Coverage |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| Population under 5,000, median household income below 80% of state median | 75% of eligible costs |
| Population under 12,000, median household income below 90% of state median | 55% of eligible costs |
| Population under 20,000, median household income below poverty line | 35% of eligible costs |

Grant funding availability depends on annual appropriations. FY2024 appropriations included **$5 million** for competitive grants plus **$505 million** in congressionally directed spending for specific projects.

### Emergency Rural Health Care Grants

The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 provided **$500 million** for emergency rural health care grants administered through Community Facilities Programs. These grants addressed pandemic related needs including lost revenue reimbursement for rural hospitals, staffing support for testing and vaccination, facility construction to expand health services, and equipment acquisition for care delivery.

USDA awarded **$484 million** in FY2022 and FY2023 under this authority. The emergency grants demonstrated capacity for rapid rural health investment that regular Community Facilities Programs could not match.

### Application Process

Community Facilities applications require extensive documentation and coordination with USDA state offices. The agency recommends submitting complete applications by mid January to allow processing before fiscal year end funding decisions in September.

Healthcare facilities unfamiliar with USDA programs frequently miss application deadlines or submit incomplete packages. State Offices of Rural Health rarely coordinate with USDA Rural Development staff, leaving potential applicants unaware of financing options.

## ReConnect Program

The **ReConnect Program** deploys broadband infrastructure to rural areas without adequate connectivity. While not a health program per se, ReConnect investments enable telehealth services that healthcare programs fund but cannot deliver without network infrastructure.

### Program Scale

ReConnect has invested **over $4.5 billion** since 2018:

| Funding Round | Investment | States/Territories |
|---------------|------------|-------------------|
| Round 1 | $607 million | 35 |
| Round 2 | $805 million | 37 |
| Round 3 | $1.67 billion | 31 |
| Round 4 | $1.44 billion (ongoing) | Multiple |

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law added billions in additional funding, positioning ReConnect as the primary USDA vehicle for rural broadband deployment.

### Healthcare Connectivity

ReConnect requires **100 Mbps symmetrical service** in funded areas, a standard adequate for most telehealth applications including video consultations, remote patient monitoring, and electronic health record transmission.

Healthcare facilities receive prioritization consideration in project scoring. Applications demonstrating that broadband deployment will enable telehealth services score higher than those serving only residential customers.

The program can fund up to **20% of project costs** for broadband facilities owned by the applicant. This provision allows healthcare organizations to participate in broadband deployment rather than waiting for commercial providers to extend service.

### Coordination Gap

ReConnect and telehealth programs operate on different timelines with different applicant pools. Internet service providers apply for ReConnect funding. Healthcare organizations apply for DLT grants and RHTP funding. Rarely do these applicants coordinate.

The result: telehealth equipment arrives in communities awaiting broadband deployment, or broadband reaches communities without healthcare organizations prepared to use it. State transformation plans could address this coordination failure but few acknowledge USDA broadband programs at all.

## Rural Health and Safety Education

USDA supports rural health education through the **Cooperative Extension System** and the **Rural Health and Safety Education Competitive Grant Program**.

### Cooperative Extension

Land grant universities operate extension offices in nearly every rural county. These offices historically focused on agricultural education but increasingly address health topics including chronic disease prevention, nutrition education, food safety training, mental health awareness, and substance use prevention.

Extension educators reach rural populations through trusted, locally embedded institutions. Their relationships with farm families and rural communities provide access that healthcare providers lack.

### Rural Health and Safety Education Grants

The National Institute of Food and Agriculture administers competitive grants for community based health education. **FY2024 appropriations totaled $4 million** for projects addressing substance abuse education, treatment, and prevention, farm safety training, chronic disease management, and health literacy improvement.

The 2018 Farm Bill prioritized substance abuse projects through FY2025, directing USDA to favor applications addressing rural addiction crises.

### SNAP and Food Access

The **Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)** provides food assistance to approximately 15% of rural households. While administered by USDA's Food and Nutrition Service rather than Rural Development, SNAP policy directly affects rural health outcomes.

**MAHA policy alignment** creates explicit intersection between SNAP administration and RHTP scoring. States implementing SNAP purchase restrictions on candy and soda receive higher RHTP application scores. States like Arkansas, Iowa, Louisiana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Texas have pursued these restrictions.

The Food and Nutrition Service also operates **nutrition education programs** through SNAP Ed, providing community based education on healthy eating. These programs reach populations that healthcare systems rarely engage effectively.

## The Rural Health Liaison

The **2018 Farm Bill** created the position of USDA Rural Health Liaison to coordinate rural health activities across the department and with the Department of Health and Human Services.

### Role and Responsibilities

The Rural Health Liaison **integrates rural health activities** across USDA mission areas, **coordinates with HHS** on shared rural health priorities, **provides technical assistance** to USDA field offices on health resources, **promotes awareness** of USDA programs supporting rural health, and **serves as contact point** for rural communities seeking health related assistance.

**Kellie Kubena** has served in the role since 2022 after acting in the position since 2021. The position operates within the USDA Rural Development Innovation Center.

### Resource Development

The Rural Health Liaison maintains the **USDA Rural Health Program Index**, a curated library of active USDA programs and resources supporting rural health. The tool allows filtering by sub agency, program type, and assistance category.

Additional resources include the **Rural Data Gateway** for community health data analysis, **success story documentation** demonstrating program impacts, and **technical assistance referrals** to appropriate USDA programs.

### Coordination Challenges

The Rural Health Liaison represents one position attempting to coordinate programs across multiple USDA agencies, each with distinct application processes, funding cycles, and eligibility requirements. State health agencies submitting RHTP applications rarely interact with USDA Rural Development offices.

The 2018 Farm Bill envisioned the Liaison facilitating HHS USDA coordination. In practice, RHTP development at CMS proceeded without systematic integration of USDA Rural Development program intelligence. State transformation plans reflect this gap.

## USDA HHS Coordination

Formal coordination mechanisms between USDA and HHS exist on paper but function inconsistently in practice.

### Interagency Rural Health Task Force

Multiple administrations have established interagency task forces addressing rural health. These bodies typically include CMS representatives, HRSA Federal Office of Rural Health Policy staff, USDA Rural Development officials, and HHS Office of Rural Health Policy personnel.

Task force activities produce reports, convene meetings, and identify coordination opportunities. They do not integrate funding streams or align application processes.

### Overlapping Jurisdiction

Both agencies fund rural health infrastructure:

| Funding Area | HHS/CMS | USDA |
|--------------|---------|------|
| Hospital construction | Limited | Community Facilities |
| Telehealth equipment | RHTP | DLT Program |
| Broadband infrastructure | None | ReConnect |
| Health workforce | HRSA/NHSC | None direct |
| Community health facilities | FQHC grants | Community Facilities |
| Nutrition education | Some CDC | SNAP Ed, Extension |

The lack of integrated application processes means rural communities must navigate separate federal bureaucracies to assemble comprehensive infrastructure financing.

### RHTP Alignment Gaps

RHTP application guidance does not require states to document coordination with USDA programs. States submitting transformation plans could demonstrate complementary USDA investments, but most do not.

Opportunities include **DLT coordination** with RHTP telehealth initiatives, **Community Facilities loans** for buildings that RHTP equips, **ReConnect projects** enabling RHTP funded telehealth services, and **Extension programs** extending RHTP prevention initiatives.

CMS scoring criteria do not advantage states demonstrating USDA program integration. The oversight ensures that coordination happens only when state officials independently recognize complementarities.

## The External View

USDA visibility in rural health discussions remains low despite substantial program investments.

### Applicant Awareness

Rural hospital administrators surveyed about financing options rarely mention USDA programs. When asked specifically, most acknowledge unfamiliarity with Community Facilities eligibility or application processes.

State Offices of Rural Health vary in USDA program knowledge. Some maintain relationships with USDA Rural Development state directors. Others focus exclusively on HHS programs.

### Program Effectiveness

Limited evaluation data exists for USDA rural health investments. The GAO noted in 2023 that rural residents face worse health outcomes including fewer providers and longer travel distances, conditions that USDA programs address indirectly through infrastructure investment.

The Emergency Rural Health Care Grants provided natural experiment conditions. Evaluation of $484 million in pandemic era investments could inform future program design, but systematic analysis has not occurred.

### Research Gaps

Academic rural health researchers concentrate on HHS programs, Medicare policy, and healthcare delivery system performance. USDA infrastructure programs receive minimal scholarly attention despite funding levels exceeding many HRSA programs.

## Politics and Policy

USDA rural health programs depend on agricultural appropriations processes that do not prioritize health outcomes.

### Rural Development Budget Stability

Annual appropriations for USDA Rural Development have remained relatively stable. Community Facilities and telecommunications programs receive consistent funding that allows multiyear planning.

This stability contrasts with health appropriations volatility. USDA programs can provide baseline infrastructure support when health program funding fluctuates.

### Farm Bill Provisions

The 2018 Farm Bill authorized rural health provisions through FY2023, subsequently extended through FY2025. A new Farm Bill could **expand Rural Health Liaison** authority and resources, **codify ReConnect** from pilot to permanent program, **increase DLT funding** for telehealth equipment, and **strengthen hospital refinancing** provisions.

Agricultural committee jurisdiction over these provisions means rural health advocates must engage different congressional actors than those shaping CMS and HRSA programs.

### Administration Priorities

Current administration emphasis on rural America creates favorable conditions for USDA rural health investment. The Make America Healthy Again framework explicitly addresses food and nutrition, areas of USDA core competency.

Whether USDA programs receive enhanced attention in RHTP implementation depends on state agency awareness and CMS encouragement. Neither is guaranteed.

## Conclusion

USDA operates rural health infrastructure programs that predate and will outlast the Rural Health Transformation Program. These programs fund construction, equipment, and connectivity that RHTP does not directly support.

**The coordination gap is real and consequential.** States submitting RHTP applications rarely reference USDA programs that could extend their transformation initiatives. CMS scoring criteria do not reward USDA program integration. The Rural Health Liaison position lacks resources to bridge agency boundaries at scale.

For states seeking maximum impact from limited RHTP allocations, USDA programs offer complementary funding. **Community Facilities** can finance buildings that RHTP equips. **DLT grants** can provide telehealth equipment that RHTP staffs. **ReConnect** can deploy broadband that RHTP funded services require. **Extension programs** can extend prevention initiatives into communities.

The $40 million DLT program and $2.8 billion Community Facilities loan authority represent resources most RHTP applicants ignore. States recognizing these complementarities can accomplish more than RHTP funding alone permits.

USDA programs also address MAHA priorities directly. Nutrition education through Extension and SNAP Ed, food access through community food systems, and chronic disease prevention through health education all align with administration emphasis on prevention over treatment.

Whether state transformation plans evolve to incorporate USDA coordination depends on state health agency capacity and initiative. USDA Rural Development will not insert itself into RHTP implementation without invitation. The opportunity exists for states willing to navigate dual federal bureaucracies.
