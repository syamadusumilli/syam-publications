# The Parallel Universe: How Indian Health Service Complicates Rural Health Transformation

The Rural Health Transformation Program operates through a state-based architecture that immediately encounters a fundamental problem: **tribal health systems exist outside state authority**. When RHTP requires states to consult with tribal affairs offices during transformation planning, it acknowledges an uncomfortable reality. The Indian Health Service and tribally-operated health programs constitute a parallel federal system with its own funding streams, governance mechanisms, legal framework, and policy history that predates contemporary rural health policy by generations. States cannot direct these systems, cannot incorporate them into state transformation plans, and cannot assume coordination will happen automatically just because geography overlaps.

Understanding this parallel universe matters because RHTP implementation will succeed or fail partly based on how states navigate the intersection of state-administered transformation funds with federally-obligated tribal health services. The federal trust responsibility for tribal health emerged from treaties, statutes, and Supreme Court precedent establishing direct government-to-government relationships between the United States and tribal nations. This obligation does not flow through states. **RHTP cannot supersede this relationship but must accommodate it**, creating coordination challenges that most states lack experience managing. States that treat tribal consultation as checkbox compliance will miss opportunities. States that engage tribal health systems as genuine partners can leverage existing infrastructure, workforce models, and community relationships that took decades to build and that address rural health challenges the broader system has not solved.

The stakes are measurable. American Indians and Alaska Natives experience **70.1 years life expectancy** compared to 78.4 years for the general population, an 8.3-year gap that represents the worst health outcomes of any racial or ethnic group in the nation. IHS receives **$4,078 per capita spending** compared to $8,109 for Medicaid, $10,692 for Veterans Health Administration, and $13,185 for Medicare. The federal government spends more than twice as much on healthcare for incarcerated individuals as it does fulfilling treaty obligations to tribal nations. These disparities exist within the same rural communities RHTP targets for transformation, creating overlapping populations served by systems that barely coordinate and that operate under fundamentally different policy frameworks.

The Indian Health Service provides healthcare to approximately 2.8 million American Indians and Alaska Natives who are members of 574 federally recognized tribes across 37 states. As the 18th largest health system in the United States, **IHS operates through a tripartite structure**: IHS-operated facilities employing federal staff under federal procurement rules, tribally-operated programs that tribes have assumed through self-determination contracts and compacts, and Urban Indian Organizations serving Native Americans who left reservation communities. As of March 2024, 526 of 574 tribes had self-determination contracts and 295 tribes had self-governance compacts. Tribes now administer over 60% of the IHS budget through these mechanisms, fundamentally decentralizing what appears on organizational charts as a single federal agency. The Urban Indian Organizations operate 41 organizations with over 85 facilities in 38 urban areas, serving patients from more than 500 tribes. These UIOs emerged from disastrous federal relocation policies of the 1950s and 1970s that moved Native Americans to cities with promises of employment, then provided no healthcare infrastructure to serve them there.

The geographic distribution of IHS services reflects historical reservation locations and subsequent migration patterns rather than contemporary rural health planning. IHS organizes through 12 Area offices covering distinct regions: Alaska, Albuquerque, Bemidji, Billings, California, Great Plains, Nashville, Navajo, Oklahoma City, Phoenix, Portland, and Tucson. Each Area has distinct population characteristics, facility types, and relationships with surrounding state health systems that developed independently of state rural health policy. Montana's RHTP application illustrates what substantive engagement looks like: the state conducted formal tribal consultation, engaged all eight tribal nations and Urban Indian Organizations, and incorporated tribal input into transformation plan components addressing care coordination and workforce development. This approach differs markedly from states that notify tribes of planning processes without creating meaningful opportunities for input.

The funding structure reveals chronic underinvestment that no single policy initiative will solve. The FY2026 budget proposes $8.1 billion for IHS, maintaining clinical service funding roughly flat with FY2025. Key components include $7.9 billion for IHS operations to fulfill trust responsibility, $159 million for Special Diabetes Program for Indians, $80 million for a new Native American Behavioral Health and Substance Use Disorder program, and $90.4 million in level funding for Urban Indian Health. **The Urban Indian Health line item represents only 1% of total IHS appropriations** despite serving populations that constitute approximately 70% of American Indians and Alaska Natives, who now live in urban areas following decades of federal relocation policies. UIOs cannot access other IHS funding streams like Hospitals and Health Clinics, Purchase and Referred Care, or Dental Services that IHS direct-service and tribal facilities receive, creating structural inequality within the tribal health system itself.

The October 2025 federal government shutdown tested a hard-won tribal health advocacy victory: advance appropriations for IHS. Unlike previous shutdowns that immediately disrupted IHS clinical services, the FY2026 advance appropriations allowed IHS to continue operations while other federal agencies furloughed staff. This achievement required years of tribal advocacy emphasizing that government shutdowns imposed disproportionate harm on tribal communities whose healthcare depended entirely on annual congressional appropriations. However, advance appropriations do not cover all IHS functions. Facilities construction, sanitation facilities construction, Contract Support Costs, lease agreements, and electronic health records remain funded through regular appropriations, creating ongoing vulnerability during budget disruptions that RHTP planning should account for but cannot eliminate.

The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975 represents one of the most significant federal Indian policy shifts of the 20th century, fundamentally reshaping the relationship between federal health services and tribal nations. The Act enables tribes to assume operation of programs that IHS would otherwise provide directly through two mechanisms with different implications for RHTP coordination. Title I self-determination contracts allow tribes to administer specific programs with detailed federal requirements for administration, reporting, and accountability. Title V self-governance compacts provide enhanced flexibility beyond Title I contracts, with tribes receiving funding agreements covering broader functions with reduced federal reporting requirements. **More than two-thirds of tribes now participate in Title V programs at IHS**, reflecting strong tribal preference for maximum autonomy in health program administration.

Self-determination success varies significantly across tribes based on factors that RHTP planning should understand but cannot easily address. Tribal capacity to operate healthcare programs requires administrative infrastructure, financial management systems, human resources functions, and clinical leadership that some tribes possess and others must build. Geographic context matters: a tribe operating a single health station faces different challenges than one assuming a 100-bed hospital serving multiple communities. Economic base creates funding disparities: tribes with gaming revenue or natural resource income can supplement federal funding while tribes without such resources operate closer to the margin. Critical mass affects service sustainability: larger tribes may achieve economies of scale while smaller tribes may lack patient volume to support specialized services.

Some tribes have leveraged self-determination to create innovative programs tailored to community needs that could inform broader RHTP workforce and service delivery models. A tribe in Washington State developed an integrated clinic combining primary care, dental, behavioral health, and opioid treatment in ways that anticipate RHTP behavioral health integration goals. A tribe in Oregon established a wellness center with culturally-grounded services that address social determinants of health alongside clinical care. Other tribes express concern about what they describe as **"termination by appropriation"**, the fear that if tribes assume all service delivery responsibility, the federal government retains only funding obligations it can more easily reduce or eliminate. Some tribes decline self-determination participation because they see no benefit in assuming responsibility for what they describe as a sinking ship of chronically underfunded programs.

The June 6, 2024 Supreme Court decision in Becerra v. San Carlos Apache Tribe carries significant implications for tribal health funding sustainability that affect the context RHTP operates within. The case addressed whether IHS must reimburse tribes for Contract Support Costs incurred when collecting and spending third-party revenue from Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurers. Chief Justice Roberts, joined by Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, Gorsuch, and Jackson, held that the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act requires IHS to pay these costs, reasoning that denying reimbursement would create **a penalty for pursuing self-determination** contrary to congressional intent. Tribes would face systematic funding shortfalls relative to IHS-operated programs, discouraging the self-determination the Act was designed to promote. Justice Kavanaugh's dissent, joined by Justices Thomas, Alito, and Barrett, argued the majority's interpretation would require $800 million to $2 billion annually in additional reimbursement that Congress should address rather than courts. IHS is implementing the decision through guidance for tribes to claim costs related to third-party revenue expenditure. For RHTP planning, the decision means tribal self-determination programs may become more financially
