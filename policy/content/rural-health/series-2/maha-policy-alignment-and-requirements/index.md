> *"We cannot continue a system that forces taxpayers to fund programs that make people sick and then pay a second time to treat the illnesses those very programs help create."*
> â€” Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

## Introduction

The Rural Health Transformation Program does not exist in isolation. It operates within a broader administration agenda that has reframed federal health policy around **Make America Healthy Again (MAHA)**, a movement emphasizing chronic disease prevention, nutrition reform, and wellness over treatment. This ideological framework shapes RHTP in ways that extend far beyond the program's statutory text.

Approximately **6.4% of RHTP workload funding** flows to states based on MAHA policy adoption. That percentage understates the influence. States positioning their applications as aligned with administration priorities received more favorable review. States that embraced SNAP restrictions, fitness initiatives, and wellness branding signaled political alignment that may have affected scoring on subjective criteria. The $12 billion MAHA carve-out within the broader RHTP structure ensures that prevention and wellness initiatives receive substantial allocation regardless of states' independent assessment of transformation priorities.

For rural health transformation, MAHA creates both opportunity and constraint. The opportunity lies in federal support for prevention, nutrition intervention, and lifestyle modification programs that could address root causes of rural health disparities. The constraint emerges when political signaling requirements diverge from evidence-based transformation strategies. States must navigate a landscape where the most effective rural health interventions may not be the most politically advantageous.

This article examines MAHA as policy framework, traces its integration into RHTP requirements, and assesses implications for states designing transformation strategies within this overlay.

## MAHA Policy Framework

### Core Priorities

President Trump established the **Make America Healthy Again Commission** by Executive Order 14212 on February 13, 2025. Chaired by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the commission was tasked with investigating root causes of chronic disease and childhood health crises. The September 2025 MAHA strategy document outlined more than 120 initiatives organized around several core themes.

**Chronic disease prevention** anchors the framework. MAHA positions America's health crisis as largely self-inflicted through poor diet, sedentary lifestyle, and environmental exposures. The solution, in this framing, requires upstream intervention rather than downstream treatment. Prevention programs addressing obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease receive priority attention.

**Nutrition and food quality** commands substantial focus. The January 2026 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, released jointly by HHS and USDA, emphasized "real food" over processed alternatives. Secretary Kennedy described the guidelines as "fundamentally upgrading the approach to nutrition taken by the United States government." Priorities include reducing added sugars, promoting whole foods, and eliminating artificial dyes from the food supply.

**Fitness and physical activity** feature prominently. The July 2025 reinstatement of the Presidential Fitness Test in schools signals broader emphasis on physical activity as health intervention. MAHA messaging treats sedentary behavior as epidemic requiring systematic response.

**Reduction of processed foods** extends beyond general nutrition guidance. FDA initiatives target petroleum-based dyes, GRAS loophole closure, and stricter regulation of food additives. The administration frames ultra-processed food as contributor to chronic disease requiring regulatory intervention.

**Wellness over treatment** captures the philosophical orientation. MAHA positions pharmaceutical intervention as downstream response to upstream failures. While the framework does not oppose medical treatment, it elevates prevention and lifestyle modification as preferred approaches to population health.

### Administration Messaging

**Secretary Kennedy** has served as primary spokesperson, framing MAHA as response to declining American health outcomes. His messaging emphasizes chronic disease rates, childhood obesity, and autism prevalence as evidence of system failure requiring transformation. Kennedy has stated that "faulty dietary guidelines have stacked the deck against families, which has fueled the chronic disease epidemic."

**CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz** has integrated MAHA priorities into Medicare and Medicaid administration. His confirmation hearing commitments included emphasis on prevention and lifestyle intervention. The RHTP email address (MAHARural@cms.hhs.gov) explicitly brands the program as MAHA initiative.

**USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins** has positioned agricultural policy as health policy, particularly through SNAP reforms and dietary guideline development. Her "Laboratories of Innovation" initiative invited states to pursue bold solutions including nutrition program restrictions.

Executive orders and interagency coordination have institutionalized MAHA across federal health policy. The commission's cross-agency membership includes EPA, USDA, and education officials alongside HHS leadership, enabling coordinated policy implementation.

### Programmatic Integration

MAHA integration into RHTP operates through multiple mechanisms.

**Application scoring factors** include state progress on MAHA-aligned policies. According to KFF analysis, approximately 6.4% of workload funding distributes based on three MAHA-related factors: SNAP food restrictions, fitness initiatives, and prevention program adoption. While this percentage appears modest, it represents meaningful funding differentials for large states and signals review priorities that may affect subjective scoring.

**Annual re-scoring criteria** ensure ongoing MAHA alignment. CMS will evaluate state performance annually against stated metrics and policy commitments. States that retreat from MAHA initiatives risk funding reduction in subsequent years.

**Clawback authority** creates enforcement mechanism. Administrator Oz has described clawback as "leverage governors can use" to maintain program alignment. States failing to meet performance metrics or policy commitments face potential fund recovery, concentrating attention on federal priorities.

The RHTP Notice of Funding Opportunity required states to describe how transformation plans advance prevention and chronic disease management, explicitly connecting program goals to MAHA framework.

## SNAP Restrictions

### State Initiatives

The most visible MAHA integration involves **SNAP food restriction waivers** allowing states to prohibit purchase of specified items with federal nutrition assistance benefits. Prior to 2025, USDA had consistently denied such waiver requests based on research concluding that restrictions would be costly to implement and might not change purchasing behavior or health outcomes. The second Trump administration reversed this position.

**Nebraska** received the first-ever SNAP food restriction waiver in May 2025, prohibiting purchase of soda and energy drinks. By January 1, 2026, five states had implemented restrictions affecting 1.4 million SNAP recipients:

| State | Restrictions | Implementation |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **Indiana** | Soft drinks and candy | January 1, 2026 |
| **Iowa** | Taxable foods including sodas, candy, prepared foods | January 1, 2026 |
| **Nebraska** | Soda and energy drinks | January 1, 2026 |
| **Utah** | Soft drinks | January 1, 2026 |
| **West Virginia** | Soda and soft drinks | January 1, 2026 |

By mid-2025, **18 states** had approved waivers with implementation dates throughout 2026. Additional states include Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Colorado, Florida, Arkansas, Idaho, Hawaii, Missouri, North Dakota, South Carolina, Virginia, and Tennessee. Each state defines "non-nutritious items" independently, creating inconsistent restrictions across jurisdictions.

**Arkansas** adopted the most extensive restrictions, prohibiting soda, fruit and vegetable drinks with less than 50% natural juice, "unhealthy drinks," and candy, with implementation scheduled for July 1, 2026. Iowa's restriction on "taxable foods" creates implementation complexity, as advocates note that "the items list does not provide enough specific information to prepare a SNAP participant to go to the grocery store."

### Scoring Impact

SNAP restriction adoption provides **RHTP application advantage**. The scoring rubric awards points for state progress toward nutrition policy reform. States implementing restrictions before or concurrent with RHTP application demonstrated policy alignment that reviewers could evaluate positively.

**Annual compliance verification** ensures sustained commitment. States that adopt restrictions for scoring advantage but subsequently retreat risk losing workload funding in subsequent budget periods. The two-year initial waiver period with optional three-year extension creates ongoing pressure for continuation.

**Political alignment signaling** extends beyond formal scoring. States that embraced MAHA language in applications, incorporated SNAP restrictions prominently in transformation plans, and engaged administration messaging demonstrated alignment that may have affected subjective evaluation. Indiana Governor Mike Braun's statement that the restrictions represent "root causes, transparent information and real results" echoes administration framing precisely.

### Policy Debate

**Evidence on effectiveness** remains contested. Prior USDA research concluded that restrictions would be costly and complicated to implement without demonstrably changing purchasing behavior or reducing health problems. Health economists note that restrictions do not address underlying issues: "This doesn't solve the two fundamental problems, which is healthy food in this country is not affordable and unhealthy food is cheap and ubiquitous."

**Implementation costs** burden retailers. The National Grocers Association, Food Industry Association, and National Association of Convenience Stores estimate that implementing SNAP restrictions will cost retailers $1.6 billion initially and $759 million annually. The National Retail Federation predicts longer checkout lines and customer complaints as recipients learn which items are restricted.

**Stigma concerns** affect recipients. Advocates argue that restrictions stigmatize SNAP participants and treat them differently from other grocery customers. One Des Moines recipient described feeling that "they treat people that get food stamps like we're not people."

**Food access implications** in rural areas add complexity. Many rural communities have limited grocery options. Restrictions may force recipients to travel farther for permitted purchases or reduce overall food access in areas where convenience stores provide primary food retail.

**Rural health perspective** creates tension with MAHA goals. If restrictions reduce SNAP utilization or create barriers to food access in rural areas, the policy may worsen food insecurity rather than improve nutrition. Rural health advocates must weigh political benefits of SNAP restriction adoption against potential harm to food-insecure rural populations.

## Fitness and Physical Activity

### Presidential Fitness Test Reinstatement

President Trump signed an executive order on **July 31, 2025** reestablishing the President's Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition and reinstating the Presidential Fitness Test. The test, which originated in the late 1950s and was discontinued under President Obama in 2012, evaluates children's physical fitness through standardized assessments including one-mile run, sit-ups, push-ups or pull-ups, and sit-and-reach flexibility test.

**Mississippi** became the first state to formally respond. Governor Tate Reeves issued Executive Order 1589 on October 30, 2025, directing implementation during the 2026-2027 academic year. Reeves framed the action within MAHA: "Students across the country are spending far too much time sitting around looking at screens and eating too much highly-processed junk food. We know that obesity, sedentary lifestyles, and poor nutrition lead to more negative health outcomes."

**Virginia** began implementation during the 2025-2026 school year. Congressional efforts to codify the executive order include the Make America's Youth Healthy Again Act (H.R.5404), introduced September 2025.

State adoption of Presidential Fitness Test aligns with RHTP scoring criteria for fitness and prevention initiatives. States implementing the test demonstrate policy alignment that contributes to workload funding calculations.

### Community Fitness Programs

Beyond school-based fitness testing, MAHA emphasizes **community fitness infrastructure**. RHTP applications incorporating fitness programming include:

**Shared-use agreements** enabling community access to school gymnasiums, fields, and facilities outside school hours. These arrangements extend public investment in physical infrastructure to broader population benefit.

**Trail and recreation expansion** addresses rural transportation barriers to fitness. Walking and biking trails, community recreation centers, and outdoor fitness equipment provide exercise options for populations lacking gym access.

**Rural adaptation challenges** complicate fitness programming. Population density too low to support fitness facilities, distance to public spaces requiring automotive transportation, weather limiting outdoor activity, and workforce constraints preventing program staffing all affect rural implementation.

### RHTP Wellness Initiatives

State applications incorporated wellness branding and fitness programming in response to MAHA priorities.

**Texas** proposed "Make Rural Texans Healthy Again" initiatives emphasizing prevention and lifestyle modification. The explicit MAHA branding signaled political alignment while proposing chronic disease prevention programming.

**North Dakota** included fitness grants for rural communities in its transformation plan. The state's extensive rural territory and harsh winters create particular challenges for physical activity programming.

State wellness initiatives must balance genuine health improvement goals against political signaling requirements. Programs designed primarily for scoring advantage rather than health impact may consume transformation resources without producing meaningful outcomes.

## Food Is Medicine

### Program Models

**Food Is Medicine (FIM)** represents a more evidence-based approach to nutrition intervention than SNAP restrictions. The American Heart Association defines FIM as "the provision of healthy food such as medically tailored meals, medically tailored groceries, and produce prescriptions to treat or manage specific clinical conditions in a way that is integrated with and paid for by the health care sector."

**Medically Tailored Meals (MTM)** provide prepared meals designed by registered dietitians to address specific medical conditions. For patients with diabetes, heart disease, cancer, or other diet-sensitive conditions, MTMs offer therapeutic nutrition as clinical intervention. The Food Is Medicine Coalition has delivered millions of MTMs through nonprofit community-based agencies since the HIV/AIDS crisis of the 1980s.

**Medically Tailored Groceries (MTG)** provide unprocessed or lightly processed grocery items, meal kits, and ingredients portioned by meal that patients prepare at home. MTGs offer flexibility for patients preferring to cook while maintaining therapeutic nutrition alignment.

**Produce Prescriptions (PPRs)** enable healthcare providers to prescribe predetermined dollar amounts for fruit and vegetable purchase. Patients receive vouchers redeemable at grocery stores, farmers markets, or community food access points. PPRs address both clinical nutrition and food security simultaneously.

Research demonstrates FIM effectiveness. A 2025 Tufts University simulation estimated that nationwide MTM implementation would reduce healthcare costs and hospitalizations in 49 of 50 states. Massachusetts Medicaid data showed nutrition supports associated with reductions in hospitalizations and emergency department visits.

### State Applications

**Sixteen states** have approved or pending Medicaid Section 1115 waivers covering nutrition interventions including medically tailored meals and groceries: California, Colorado, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Washington.

**Arkansas HEART initiative** incorporates FIM alongside broader MAHA wellness programming. The state positions nutrition intervention as chronic disease treatment while emphasizing personal responsibility messaging.

**Maryland "Eat for Health"** program provides produce prescriptions and nutrition education. State-level programs increasingly integrate FIM into managed care delivery systems.

**Oregon Health-Related Social Needs benefit**, approved under the state's 1115 waiver, covers medically tailored meals (up to three per day for six months), meals or pantry stocking, and fruit and vegetable prescriptions.

### Rural Implementation

**Food access challenges** complicate rural FIM implementation. Community-based organizations that typically deliver MTMs in urban areas may lack rural service capacity. Transportation barriers prevent some patients from accessing distribution sites. Meal delivery logistics become expensive across low-density geographies.

**Supply chain limitations** affect MTG and PPR programs. Rural grocery stores may lack fresh produce variety. Farmers markets operate seasonally if at all. Food delivery services may not serve remote areas.

**Local food system development** offers potential solution. RHTP could support infrastructure connecting rural agricultural production to rural health system nutrition programming. Farm-to-institution pathways, community food hubs, and regional food system coordination could address both nutrition intervention and agricultural economic development.

FIM represents MAHA-aligned programming with stronger evidence base than SNAP restrictions. States seeking to demonstrate prevention commitment while pursuing effective intervention may find FIM programs advantageous.

## Prevention and Chronic Disease

### Evidence-Based Programs

RHTP statutory categories explicitly authorize "evidence-based, measurable interventions to improve prevention and chronic disease management." This language enables states to fund established prevention programs with demonstrated effectiveness.

**Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP)** offers structured lifestyle intervention for prediabetes populations. The CDC-recognized program provides year-long curricula addressing nutrition, physical activity, and behavior modification. DPP has demonstrated 58% diabetes incidence reduction in clinical trials. Oregon and other states have integrated DPP into Medicaid coverage.

**Hypertension management programs** address the leading cardiovascular disease risk factor. Team-based care models, community health worker integration, and self-measured blood pressure monitoring have demonstrated effectiveness in reducing blood pressure and cardiovascular events.

**Cancer screening programs** expand access to preventive services. Mobile mammography, colonoscopy access programs, and lung cancer screening initiatives address rural screening disparities.

**Kansas health kiosks** represent technology-enabled prevention. The state's RHTP application includes biometric screening stations providing blood pressure, weight, and other measurements in community settings, connecting residents to prevention services.

### Lifestyle Intervention Models

**Community health worker integration** extends prevention workforce capacity. CHWs provide health education, care navigation, and social support in communities lacking clinical providers. Their role in prevention programming aligns with both MAHA wellness emphasis and rural workforce strategies.

**Peer support programs** leverage lived experience for behavior change. Diabetes peer support, cardiac rehabilitation peer mentoring, and addiction recovery peer services demonstrate effectiveness while building community health capacity.

**Technology-enabled coaching** addresses rural distance barriers. Remote health coaching for weight management, diabetes prevention, and chronic disease self-management can reach rural populations without requiring travel. Digital health platforms enable scaling across dispersed geographies.

### Outcome Measurement

RHTP requires states to establish **performance metrics and targets** for transformation initiatives. Prevention programs must demonstrate measurable outcomes to satisfy both program requirements and annual re-scoring criteria.

**Chronic disease prevalence tracking** through Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and other population health surveys provides baseline and trend data. States can measure diabetes rates, obesity prevalence, hypertension control, and other indicators.

**RHTP performance metrics** must align with program goals while remaining achievable within funding periods. States setting overly ambitious targets risk clawback if outcomes fall short. States setting minimal targets may receive lower initial scores.

The tension between meaningful outcome measurement and realistic target-setting will shape how prevention programming evolves throughout the RHTP period.

## State Positioning Strategies

### Rapid Policy Adoption

States seeking maximum RHTP funding pursued **rapid policy alignment** with MAHA priorities. The compressed timeline between NOFO release (September 15, 2025) and application deadline (November 5, 2025) required quick decisions about policy commitments.

**Mississippi's trajectory** illustrates rapid adoption. Governor Reeves issued the Presidential Fitness Test executive order in October 2025, shortly before RHTP application submission. The state had previously adopted SNAP restriction waivers. These actions positioned Mississippi as MAHA-aligned for application scoring.

**Application deadline alignment** drove policy timing. States that might have deliberated longer about SNAP restrictions or fitness initiatives accelerated decisions to demonstrate commitment in applications. The deadline created urgency that favored adoption over careful evaluation.

**Sustainability questions** remain. States that adopted policies primarily for application advantage may face pressure to maintain commitments through annual re-scoring periods even if policies prove unpopular or ineffective. Retreat from MAHA positions risks funding reduction.

### Branding and Messaging

**MAHA language in applications** signaled political alignment. State applications incorporating "Make America Healthy Again," "wellness," and "prevention" terminology demonstrated familiarity with administration priorities.

**Administration priority alignment** extended beyond specific policies. Applications emphasizing personal responsibility, lifestyle modification, and upstream prevention reflected MAHA philosophical orientation regardless of specific program content.

**Political signaling value** may exceed programmatic benefit. States that successfully positioned as MAHA champions may receive favorable treatment in subjective review criteria, technical assistance allocation, or waiver approvals beyond RHTP.

### Risk Calculation

**Clawback authority** creates ongoing pressure. States must weigh initial scoring benefits of aggressive MAHA positioning against sustainability requirements for maintaining policies through 2030.

**Policy reversal consequences** remain unclear. If states that adopted SNAP restrictions face implementation failures, political backlash, or evidence of harm, they must calculate whether reversal risks funding more than continuation.

**Long-term commitment uncertainty** affects planning. MAHA represents current administration priority. Whether subsequent administrations will maintain RHTP MAHA scoring factors, enforce clawback for policy retreat, or redefine transformation priorities remains unknown. States making five-year commitments based on 2025 scoring criteria face substantial uncertainty.

## The External View

### Public Health Community Response

**Traditional public health advocates** have expressed concern about MAHA's scientific foundation. The May 2025 MAHA Assessment report faced criticism for citations to non-existent studies, suggestive of AI generation without verification. Critics argue that MAHA rhetoric sometimes contradicts established evidence, particularly regarding vaccines.

**Nutrition researchers** offer mixed assessment of SNAP restrictions. While reducing sugar consumption aligns with nutrition science, the restriction mechanism may not be optimal. "Punishing SNAP recipients means we all get to pay more at the grocery store," noted one advocate, pointing to implementation costs passed to all consumers.

**Food Is Medicine proponents** have found MAHA alignment more straightforward. The emphasis on nutrition as medicine and food as health intervention resonates with FIM evidence base. Programs like medically tailored meals and produce prescriptions can advance under MAHA framing without contradicting established science.

### Evidence Base Debates

**SNAP restriction evidence** does not clearly support effectiveness. Prior USDA research concluded restrictions would not meaningfully change behavior or health outcomes. Proponents argue that previous studies did not evaluate comprehensive restrictions or that policy goals extend beyond individual behavior change to taxpayer protection and programmatic integrity.

**Fitness test effectiveness** for health improvement remains undemonstrated. Critics note that measurement does not itself produce health benefits. Proponents frame testing as awareness-building and motivation mechanism rather than direct intervention.

**FIM evidence** is strongest. Multiple studies demonstrate medically tailored meal effectiveness for chronic disease management. Cost-effectiveness modeling suggests healthcare savings across nearly all states. This evidence base enables states to pursue MAHA-aligned programming with scientific credibility.

### Political Framing vs. Health Impact

MAHA creates tension between **political requirements and evidence-based practice**. States may find that maximum RHTP scoring requires policy adoptions that evidence does not support, while evidence-supported interventions may not generate comparable political credit.

**Rural health advocacy** positions vary. The National Rural Health Association has expressed concern about states that did not adopt MAHA policies facing scoring disadvantage. NRHA has noted that non-MAHA states may have legitimate transformation priorities not captured in federal scoring.

States must navigate this landscape carefully, pursuing genuine health improvement while demonstrating sufficient political alignment to secure transformation funding.

## Politics and Policy

### Democratic vs. Republican State Approaches

**Republican governors** have more readily embraced MAHA branding and specific policy adoptions. States implementing SNAP restrictions are predominantly Republican-led. Presidential Fitness Test adoption has followed similar patterns. These states face lower political cost for alignment with Republican administration priorities.

**Democratic states** must calculate whether MAHA adoption creates political liability with their electoral coalitions. Some Democratic governors have pursued FIM and prevention programming without explicit MAHA branding, advancing wellness goals through alternative framing. Others have adopted SNAP restrictions despite partisan incongruity, prioritizing federal funding access over ideological consistency.

**Swing state calculations** add complexity. States with competitive partisan environments may face cross-pressures between federal funding optimization and state-level political positioning.

### NRHA Non-MAHA State Concerns

The National Rural Health Association has highlighted **equity concerns** in MAHA-weighted scoring. States that declined SNAP restrictions or fitness test adoption for legitimate policy reasons may receive systematically lower funding despite equivalent or superior transformation plan quality.

**Alternative transformation priorities** may not receive equivalent scoring credit. States emphasizing workforce development, hospital stabilization, or technology infrastructure rather than wellness programming may find their genuine priorities disadvantaged relative to MAHA-aligned alternatives.

**Non-expansion state implications** create additional complexity. States that have not expanded Medicaid face greater coverage gaps and hospital financial distress. If these states also decline MAHA adoption, they may face compounded scoring disadvantage.

### Policy Durability Across Administrations

RHTP extends through FY2030, spanning at least two presidential elections. **Policy durability** questions will shape state strategy.

If administration change brings new priorities, states that built transformation plans around MAHA alignment may find their initiatives misaligned with successor emphasis. Clawback provisions and annual re-scoring create mechanisms for policy enforcement, but new administrators could redefine scoring criteria or deprioritize enforcement.

States building sustainable transformation should consider whether initiatives require ongoing federal policy alignment or can continue independently. Programs dependent on MAHA-specific features face greater vulnerability to political transition than programs that happen to align with current priorities while serving enduring health needs.

### Evidence-Based vs. Politically Motivated Requirements

The fundamental tension in MAHA integration involves **distinguishing evidence from ideology**. Some MAHA elements reflect sound public health practice: chronic disease prevention, nutrition intervention, physical activity promotion. Other elements may reflect political objectives more than health science.

States have limited capacity to evaluate which MAHA components will produce health benefits and which represent compliance requirements without independent justification. The safest approach may be identifying overlap between evidence-supported interventions and MAHA-scored activities, maximizing both scientific credibility and political alignment.

## Conclusion

MAHA functions as **policy overlay** on RHTP structure, shaping state options without replacing statutory framework. The $12 billion prevention carve-out, 6.4% workload scoring weight, annual re-evaluation criteria, and clawback authority collectively ensure that states cannot ignore MAHA even if they question its scientific foundation.

**State compliance calculations** must weigh multiple factors. SNAP restrictions provide scoring credit but face implementation challenges and contested evidence. Fitness programming aligns with wellness emphasis but may not produce measurable health outcomes. Food Is Medicine offers strongest evidence base while advancing MAHA goals.

**Wellness focus implications** for transformation are ambiguous. If MAHA priorities genuinely address chronic disease drivers, states that align may produce better health outcomes. If MAHA represents political signaling without health substance, compliance requirements may divert resources from more effective interventions.

Rural communities will experience MAHA through their states' strategic choices. States that pursue genuine prevention while satisfying political requirements may achieve both transformation and compliance. States that prioritize scoring over effectiveness may find that federal funding comes at cost to health improvement.

The test of MAHA integration will emerge over five years: whether transformation plans that emphasized wellness produce better outcomes than plans that prioritized other approaches. Until that evidence accumulates, states navigate uncertainty, seeking funding while hoping their compliance choices serve rather than undermine the populations they aim to transform.
