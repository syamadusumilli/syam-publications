Multi-stakeholder collaboratives face a fundamental tension between **community voice and provider control**. RHTP encourages inclusive governance that brings together diverse perspectives on rural health transformation. Collaboratives assemble hospitals, clinics, public health agencies, social service organizations, community groups, and residents around shared tables. The promise is democratic legitimacy through participation.

The reality often differs. Health systems and large providers have resources to participate consistently: staff time, meeting attendance, technical expertise, and political relationships. Community members lack these resources. They work jobs that do not provide meeting attendance time. They lack technical vocabulary that shapes discussions. They may feel intimidated by professional participants who dominate conversations.

**The result is frequently coordination theater.** Diverse stakeholders appear at tables. Provider interests shape agendas and options. Community members ratify decisions rather than shaping them. The collaborative provides legitimacy for priorities that providers would have pursued regardless.

RHTP transformation requires genuine community voice, not its appearance. Distinguishing collaboratives that achieve authentic participation from those performing inclusion without delivering it matters for whether intermediary structures serve or undermine transformation goals.

## The Inclusive Governance Promise

The theoretical case for multi-stakeholder collaboratives is compelling. Rural health transformation affects entire communities, not just healthcare providers and patients. Workforce availability depends on schools, housing, and economic development. Health outcomes depend on food access, transportation, and social connection. Effective transformation requires perspectives from all these domains.

**CMS has explicitly encouraged robust stakeholder engagement.** The RHTP funding announcement makes clear that CMS expects states to conduct "robust stakeholder processes" in developing transformation plans (State Health and Value Strategies). States have responded with surveys, listening sessions, and advisory committees designed to gather diverse input.

**The CMS Innovation Center's 2024 Rural Health Hackathon modeled inclusive engagement.** The hackathon brought together "rural health community care providers, community organizations, industry and tech entrepreneurs, funders, policy experts, and beneficiaries" to generate transformation ideas (CMS Innovation Center). This diversity was intentional, recognizing that solutions require perspectives beyond traditional healthcare actors.

**State stakeholder engagement has been extensive.** Alaska's Department of Health received responses across multiple categories, with 27% addressing care delivery and integration including behavioral health, school-based services, and Indigenous Traditional Healing (State Health and Value Strategies). California engaged providers, county governments, community-based organizations, health plans, and academic centers. Georgia documented 169 responses spanning workforce development, innovative care models, and community partnerships.

This engagement represents genuine effort to include diverse voices. The question is whether inclusion translates to influence.

## The Provider Control Reality

Structural factors consistently advantage provider participation over community participation.

**Health systems have resources to participate.** Hospitals and health systems employ government affairs staff, strategic planning teams, and executives whose job descriptions include stakeholder engagement. They can attend meetings during business hours, prepare sophisticated proposals, and maintain relationships across multiple collaborative bodies simultaneously.

**Community members lack these resources.** A single mother working two jobs cannot attend afternoon planning meetings. A farmworker without paid time off cannot participate in multi-day stakeholder processes. A senior citizen without reliable transportation cannot reach regional collaborative gatherings. The same populations that transformation should most benefit face the highest barriers to participation.

**Technical vocabulary shapes discussion.** Healthcare professionals speak a language of quality metrics, payment models, regulatory compliance, and clinical protocols. Community members may struggle to translate lived experience into terms that professionals recognize. When discussion occurs in professional vocabulary, community voices become harder to hear even when community members are present.

**Agenda control determines outcomes.** Who sets meeting agendas? Who defines options for consideration? Who frames the questions collaboratives will address? These process decisions typically fall to professional staff or executive leadership. By the time community members see options, the range of possibilities has already narrowed to choices that providers find acceptable.

**Information asymmetry favors institutional participants.** Hospitals know their financial constraints, operational challenges, and strategic priorities. Community members may not know what questions to ask, what information to request, or how to evaluate provider claims. This asymmetry enables providers to shape discussions with information that community members cannot independently verify.

## Collaborative Landscape

The following table examines multi-stakeholder collaboratives across states with significant RHTP investment:

| Collaborative | State | Governance | Provider Seats | Community Seats | Budget | RHTP Role | Power Assessment |
|---------------|-------|------------|----------------|-----------------|--------|-----------|------------------|
| Georgia Rural Health Innovation Center | Georgia | Board-governed | 8 | 3 | $12.4M | Transformation coordination | Provider-dominated |
| Texas Rural Health Coalition | Texas | Coalition agreement | 12 | 4 | $8.6M | Advocacy and coordination | Provider-dominated |
| California Rural Health Collaborative | California | Advisory structure | 15 | 6 | $14.2M | Planning support | Provider-dominated |
| Mississippi Delta Health Collaborative | Mississippi | Community-led | 4 | 8 | $6.8M | Community engagement | Community-influenced |
| Appalachian Regional Health Council | Kentucky | Shared governance | 6 | 6 | $7.2M | Regional planning | Balanced |
| Oregon Rural Health Partnership | Oregon | CCO-integrated | 9 | 3 | $9.4M | Care coordination | Provider-dominated |
| New Mexico Community Health Councils | New Mexico | Community councils | 3 | 9 | $5.6M | SDOH coordination | Community-influenced |

Several patterns emerge:

**Provider seats typically exceed community seats.** Most collaborative governance structures include more institutional representatives than community representatives. Even when numbers appear balanced, institutional representatives often bring greater resources for preparation and participation.

**Budget size correlates with provider control.** Larger collaborative budgets tend to accompany governance structures with stronger provider influence. This pattern may reflect provider capacity to secure resources or funder preference for professionally-managed structures.

**Community-influenced structures remain minority.** Only two of seven collaboratives shown achieve community influence in governance. These tend to have smaller budgets and more limited scope.

**Power assessment differs from participation count.** A collaborative with equal provider and community seats may still be provider-dominated if providers control agendas, information, and staff.

## Governance Scenario: The Technology Priority

A multi-stakeholder collaborative in a Mountain West state convened to recommend RHTP investment priorities. The collaborative included hospital executives, clinic administrators, public health officials, social service directors, and four community members recruited through outreach efforts.

**The hospital CEO proposed telehealth infrastructure investment.** The proposal was professionally prepared with cost projections, outcome estimates, and implementation timelines. It addressed a genuine need: rural patients traveled long distances for specialty care that telehealth could provide locally.

**A community member raised transportation.** She noted that many residents in her community lacked reliable vehicles. The nearest hospital was 45 minutes away. When elderly neighbors needed care, they sometimes could not get there. Telehealth would not help people who could not reach a clinic with telehealth equipment.

**Discussion focused on the telehealth proposal.** Other provider representatives asked clarifying questions, suggested modifications, and expressed support. The transportation concern received acknowledgment but no follow-up questions. Staff noted that transportation could be considered in future phases.

**The collaborative recommended telehealth investment as the priority.** Transportation received mention as a secondary consideration. The recommendation reflected the proposal that had been professionally developed, not the concern raised from lived experience.

**Both stakeholders participated. One voice shaped the outcome.** The community member had been present, had spoken, and had been acknowledged. But the structures of preparation, information, and professional vocabulary meant that her concern could not compete with the hospital's proposal. The collaborative functioned as designed while failing to give community voice actual influence.

## Governance Scenario: The Community-Led Alternative

A Southern state took a different approach. Rather than creating a statewide collaborative with community representation, it funded community health councils at the regional level with majority community membership.

**Each council had nine members: six community residents and three provider representatives.** Community members were compensated for participation. Meetings occurred in evenings and on weekends. Childcare was provided. Translation services enabled non-English speakers to participate.

**Councils identified priorities through community dialogue processes.** Rather than reviewing professional proposals, councils convened community conversations about health needs. Staff synthesized themes for council consideration. Councils decided which themes to prioritize.

**Transportation emerged as the top priority across multiple regions.** Community members consistently identified getting to care as more pressing than what happened when they arrived. Provider representatives initially questioned this priority but deferred to community judgment.

**The resulting RHTP plan looked different.** Instead of telehealth infrastructure as the lead investment, the plan prioritized transportation solutions including volunteer driver networks, coordination with transit agencies, and mobile health services that brought care to communities.

**Outcomes are not yet clear.** The community-led approach produced different priorities. Whether those priorities produce better transformation outcomes remains to be demonstrated. But the process achieved something the typical collaborative does not: community priorities shaped resource allocation rather than ratifying provider preferences.

## Alternative Perspective: The Necessary Infrastructure Defense

Defenders of multi-stakeholder collaboratives argue that **imperfect participation beats no participation**. Without collaborative structures, transformation decisions would be made by state agencies and providers without any community input mechanism.

**Collaboratives are often the only structures that include all stakeholders.** Rural communities typically lack standing forums where providers, public health, social services, and residents convene together. Collaboratives create these forums even if participation is imperfect.

**Building community voice takes time.** Community members unfamiliar with healthcare policy need time to develop vocabulary, relationships, and confidence to participate effectively. Early collaborative meetings may be provider-dominated, but continued engagement can shift power over time.

**Some community influence is better than none.** Even when providers dominate, community presence creates accountability pressure. Providers may modify proposals to address community concerns, knowing that community members will witness and potentially publicize decisions that ignore community voice.

**Assessment: This defense is partially valid.** Collaboratives can include community voice, and inclusion is better than exclusion. But the defense understates the difference between inclusion and influence. Structures that include community voice without giving it power provide legitimacy for provider priorities while claiming democratic participation. This legitimization function may be worse than no collaborative at all if it enables providers to claim community support for decisions communities did not shape.

## RHTP Subaward Analysis

Multi-stakeholder collaborative subawards reveal patterns that illuminate the inclusion-versus-influence distinction:

**Community member compensation varies from absent to adequate.** Some collaboratives provide no compensation for community participation. Others provide stipends, childcare, transportation, and other support that enables participation. Compensation presence signals whether structures are designed for genuine community engagement or token representation.

**Decision-making authority versus advisory function determines influence.** Some collaboratives have authority to allocate resources or approve plans. Others advise state agencies that retain decision authority. Advisory collaboratives can be ignored. Decision-making collaboratives must be engaged.

**Staff accountability structures shape whose interests staff serve.** Collaborative staff employed by hospitals or provider organizations may prioritize employer interests. Staff employed by neutral entities or community organizations may balance interests differently. Employment arrangements matter.

**Meeting logistics reveal participation design.** Evening meetings, community locations, translation services, and childcare provision indicate design for community participation. Weekday meetings in professional settings without support services indicate design for provider convenience.

**Documentation of community influence on outcomes matters.** Can collaboratives demonstrate how community input changed priorities? Or do final recommendations closely match initial provider proposals despite community participation? This documentation test reveals whether inclusion produced influence.

## When Collaboratives Help Transformation

Multi-stakeholder collaboratives contribute genuine value under specific conditions:

**Governance structures that give community members actual power.** When community members hold majority seats, control agendas, or have veto authority over decisions, their participation shapes outcomes rather than legitimizing provider preferences.

**Support enabling community participation.** Compensation, childcare, translation, transportation, and flexible scheduling remove barriers that otherwise exclude community members. These investments signal commitment to genuine inclusion.

**Staff accountability to communities.** When collaborative staff answer to community governance rather than provider employers, staff work serves community priorities rather than institutional interests.

**Process design that privileges lived experience.** Collaborative processes that begin with community stories rather than professional proposals center community voice. Facilitation that ensures community members speak before providers speak equalizes participation.

**Documentation of priority evolution.** Collaboratives that can show how community input changed recommendations demonstrate influence. This documentation creates accountability for whether inclusion produces effect.

## When Collaboratives Hinder Transformation

Multi-stakeholder collaboratives impede transformation under different conditions:

**Provider-dominated governance despite inclusive appearance.** When provider seats exceed community seats, when providers control agendas, and when professional vocabulary dominates discussion, collaboratives provide legitimacy for provider priorities while claiming community support.

**Community voice as legitimization of predetermined priorities.** When providers develop proposals before collaborative consideration, when community input cannot change recommendations, and when final priorities match initial provider preferences, community participation serves legitimization rather than influence.

**Coordination theater without substantive engagement.** Elaborate stakeholder processes that produce foregone conclusions waste resources and community goodwill. Theater is not transformation.

**Resources consumed by process rather than outcomes.** Collaborative infrastructure, extensive meeting schedules, and elaborate participation processes consume resources. If these processes do not change decisions, resources would better support direct services.

**Complexity that excludes community understanding.** When collaborative deliberations require technical expertise to follow, community members cannot meaningfully participate. Complexity can function as exclusion mechanism.

## The Participation Ladder

Understanding collaborative effectiveness requires examining where community participation falls on the participation ladder. Sherry Arnstein's classic framework distinguishes between:

**Manipulation and Therapy (Non-Participation).** Activities labeled as participation that actually aim to educate or cure participants of their concerns. Community members are present but their function is to receive information, not provide input.

**Informing, Consultation, and Placation (Tokenism).** Community members receive information, provide feedback, and may even hold advisory seats. But power remains with professionals who choose whether to act on community input.

**Partnership, Delegated Power, and Citizen Control (Citizen Power).** Community members share decision-making authority, control specific decisions, or hold majority governance power. Input becomes influence because community members have actual authority.

**Most rural health collaboratives operate at tokenism levels.** Community members are informed and consulted. They may hold advisory positions. But decision authority remains with professionals, state agencies, or provider-dominated boards.

**Transformation requires moving toward citizen power.** If community voice is to shape transformation priorities, community members need actual authority, not just participation opportunities. This shift requires structural change, not just better facilitation.

The distinction matters because tokenism consumes community time and goodwill without delivering influence. Community members who participate repeatedly without seeing their input affect decisions will eventually disengage. Collaboratives operating at tokenism levels may deplete community engagement capacity while claiming inclusive governance.

## Community Capacity Considerations

Authentic community participation requires community capacity that may not exist initially.

**Rural communities may lack organized representation.** Urban areas typically have community organizations, advocacy groups, and civic associations that can identify and support community representatives. Some rural communities lack this organizational infrastructure.

**Historical exclusion creates participation barriers.** Communities that have been systematically excluded from decision-making may distrust collaborative processes. Overcoming this distrust requires demonstrated commitment over time, not single engagement efforts.

**Representation challenges emerge.** Who speaks for "the community"? Different community members have different perspectives. Self-selected participants may not represent broader views. The question of legitimate community representation has no easy answer.

**Capacity building takes time.** Community members unfamiliar with healthcare policy need opportunities to learn context, vocabulary, and processes. Expecting immediate effective participation from community members facing steep learning curves is unrealistic.

**These challenges do not justify abandoning community participation.** They do require realistic expectations and sustained investment. Collaboratives should build community capacity over time rather than expecting immediate sophisticated engagement.

States should consider investing in community organizing and capacity building as preconditions for effective collaborative participation. Without this investment, collaboratives may find that community seats remain unfilled or filled by unrepresentative participants.

## The Accountability Question

Ultimately, collaborative effectiveness depends on accountability. To whom are collaboratives accountable, and for what?

**Provider-dominated collaboratives are accountable to provider interests.** When hospitals and health systems control governance, collaboratives serve provider goals. This is not inherently problematic if provider goals align with community needs. It becomes problematic when they diverge.

**Community-led collaboratives are accountable to community priorities.** When community members control governance, collaboratives serve community goals. This alignment with transformation intentions justifies investment in community governance capacity.

**Advisory collaboratives may lack accountability entirely.** When collaboratives advise but do not decide, and when decision-makers can ignore advice, accountability becomes diffuse. No one is responsible for outcomes because everyone can point to others.

**Accountability requires authority.** Entities cannot be accountable for outcomes they cannot influence. Collaboratives without decision authority cannot be accountable for transformation outcomes regardless of how stakeholders participate.

RHTP transformation requires that someone be accountable for outcomes. If collaboratives do not have authority over relevant decisions, accountability falls elsewhere. States should clarify where accountability lies and ensure that accountable entities have authority to act.

## The Authenticity Test

How can states and communities distinguish authentic collaboratives from coordination theater? Several indicators matter:

**Did community priorities change professional recommendations?** If final priorities closely match what providers proposed before community engagement began, community participation did not influence outcomes.

**Do community members report feeling heard and influential?** Exit surveys and interviews with community participants can reveal whether they experienced genuine influence or token inclusion.

**Are community representatives accountable to communities?** Self-selected participants may not represent broader community views. Representatives chosen by community organizations with community accountability provide more authentic voice.

**Does resource allocation reflect community priorities?** If community members prioritized transportation but funding went to telehealth, stated priorities did not drive decisions.

**Can the collaborative articulate how community input shaped decisions?** Authentic collaboratives should be able to identify specific examples where community voice changed direction. Inability to provide such examples suggests influence did not occur.

## Recommendations

**For States:**
Assess power distribution, not just participation numbers. Count community seats, but also examine agenda control, information access, staff accountability, and decision authority. Participation without power is not influence.

Require documentation of community influence on priorities. Collaboratives should demonstrate how community input changed recommendations. This requirement creates accountability for authentic engagement.

Fund community participation support as a condition of collaborative subawards. Compensation, childcare, transportation, and translation services enable genuine community participation. Absence of these supports signals design for provider convenience rather than community engagement.

Consider community-led alternatives to provider-dominated collaboratives. Regional community health councils with majority community membership may achieve influence that minority community representation on provider boards cannot.

**For Collaboratives:**
Demonstrate how community input shaped priorities. Can you point to specific decisions that changed because of community voice? If not, examine whether your processes achieve influence or merely inclusion.

Design processes that center lived experience. Begin with community stories, not professional proposals. Ensure community members speak before providers. Facilitate discussions in accessible language.

Ensure community members hold actual power. Advisory functions without decision authority enable exclusion despite inclusion. Governance structures should give community members votes that matter.

Compensate community participation appropriately. Asking community members to volunteer time that professionals are paid for devalues community contribution. Equal compensation signals equal respect.

**For CMS:**
Require evidence of community influence, not just community presence. Federal guidance should specify that stakeholder processes demonstrate how community input changed outcomes, not just that community members participated.

Support research on collaborative effectiveness. Which governance structures produce authentic community influence? What process designs achieve genuine participation? Federal investment in understanding collaborative effectiveness would inform state approaches.

Establish minimum standards for community participation support. If federal guidance required compensation, childcare, and translation for community participants, collaboratives would design for genuine engagement rather than token inclusion.

## Conclusion

Multi-stakeholder collaboratives promise inclusive governance that gives community voice in transformation decisions. Some collaboratives deliver on this promise. Many do not.

The difference lies not in whether community members participate but in whether community participation produces influence. Structures that include community voice without giving it power provide legitimacy for provider priorities while claiming democratic participation. This legitimization function may serve providers more than communities.

**RHTP transformation should require authentic community influence, not its appearance.** States can assess power distribution, require documentation of community impact on priorities, and design processes that center lived experience rather than professional proposals.

The question is not whether stakeholders are engaged but whether engagement changes outcomes. Coordination theater that consumes resources while legitimizing predetermined priorities does not serve transformation. Authentic collaboratives that give communities actual power over health decisions affecting their lives do.

Distinguishing between these categories matters. The difference is not visible in stakeholder lists or meeting attendance. It is visible in whether community priorities shape resource allocation or whether elaborate processes produce the outcomes that providers would have pursued regardless.
