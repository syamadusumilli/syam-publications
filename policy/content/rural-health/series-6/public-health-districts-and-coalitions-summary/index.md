The Rural Health Transformation Program confronts a fundamental paradox in public health infrastructure. Rural areas experience greater health burdens (elevated chronic disease rates, older populations, limited healthcare access, environmental exposures) yet possess fewer resources to address them. Small rural health departments serving populations of 12,000 with three-person staffs cannot maintain epidemiologists, emergency preparedness coordinators, or data analytics capacity that population health improvement demands. **Regional aggregation promises the scale required for specialized functions that individual departments cannot support.** But aggregation creates distance from the communities these structures serve, replacing local accountability with governance bodies composed of jurisdiction representatives who may reflect institutional interests rather than population needs.

This tension between aggregation efficiency and community accountability defines the dilemma that $50 billion in RHTP funding must navigate. States have constructed varied responses: state-directed districts operating as extensions of state health departments, locally governed multi-county districts under boards of county appointees, coalition models bringing independent departments together for specific functions, and integrated health system models connecting public health with coordinated care organizations. Each model makes different tradeoffs between technical capacity and democratic voice. None resolves the core tension completely.

The efficiency case rests on genuine capacity constraints. **Approximately 2,800 local health departments operate across the United States with enormous variation in resources.** Large urban departments employ hundreds of specialized staff while small rural departments may have fewer than five employees covering all functions. Epidemiological analysis requires training and tools individual rural departments cannot maintain. Emergency preparedness planning requires coordination across jurisdictions individual departments cannot achieve. Population health data analytics require technical capacity small departments cannot afford. One in four local health departments report their top executive is a state employee, indicating the extent to which state structures already extend into local operations (though state employment differs from regional aggregation by maintaining hierarchical accountability rather than creating lateral coordination).

Against this efficiency argument stands a democracy deficit that compounds existing inequities. **Local health departments answer to local government through county commissioners, city councils, or local boards of health elected by or accountable to local populations.** Regional entities answer to boards composed of member jurisdiction representatives who may be appointed rather than elected and who represent jurisdictional interests rather than population needs. Low-income communities, minority populations, tribal members, farmworkers, and recent migrants with limited political voice in their home jurisdictions find regional structures even less accessible than local ones. When regional coalitions decide surveillance priorities, resource allocation, or intervention strategies affecting populations throughout their service area, decision-making processes may include no mechanisms for community input beyond periodic needs assessments that inform rather than bind.

RHTP subaward data reveals this accountability gap in practice. The analysis examines seven regional public health structures across states with significant RHTP investment, serving populations ranging from 86,000 to 320,000 with subawards between $2.9 million and $6.4 million. **Governance structures vary from state-directed regional boards to coalition agreements with rotating chairs, but community voice mechanisms range from absent to advisory.** Some structures include community advisory committees; most do not include community members in governance bodies with decision-making authority. The Delta Public Health Coalition serving 320,000 receives similar funding to Appalachian District Health serving 185,000, indicating per-capita investment varies by more than threefold across similar regional structures without clear correlation to population size or health burden.

A governance scenario illustrates the accountability problem in concrete terms. A regional coalition covering eight rural counties received $4.2 million for population health infrastructure including enhanced surveillance capacity. Staff conducted thorough epidemiological analysis showing elevated rates of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and substance use disorder across the region, with opioid overdose deaths increased 40% over five years. Staff recommended prioritizing opioid surveillance and diabetes monitoring based on disease burden data and available intervention capacity. **The recommendation was evidence-based, professionally defensible, and technically sound.** Community input was limited to a public comment period at a quarterly meeting attended by three community members. One raised concerns about maternal health indicators in her county showing concerning trends. Staff acknowledged the concern and noted maternal health could be incorporated in future phases. The coalition approved the staff recommendation without modification.

Two years later, the county that raised concerns experienced a maternal death that might have been prevented with earlier intervention. Community members questioned why maternal health had not been prioritized when concerns were raised. Coalition leadership pointed to the evidence-based process that informed priorities. **The process was efficient but not accountable.** Technical expertise drove decisions while community voice was heard but did not shape outcomes. The surveillance system worked well for the priorities professionals selected but did not work for priorities the community identified but professionals did not prioritize.

Recent developments offer alternative models. The Northeast Public Health Collaborative formed in 2025 brings together ten northeastern states to coordinate public health functions independently of federal guidance when federal direction diverged from scientific consensus during political transitions. This coalition differs from traditional regional structures in preserving clearer accountability chains (state-level participation maintains democratic accountability through elected governors and legislatures), voluntary participation (states can adopt or decline coalition recommendations based on their own assessment), and limited scope (emergency preparedness, vaccine recommendations, disease surveillance, laboratory services rather than comprehensive governance). **Coordination without governance substitution preserves local accountability while enabling capacity that individual jurisdictions cannot maintain.** The question is whether voluntary coordination can achieve the efficiency gains that more integrated structures promise.

Critics argue the community accountability gap is not incidental but structural. Coalition boards represent jurisdictions through county health directors, commissioners, or appointed officials who represent institutional interests of their jurisdictions but may not represent population needs within those jurisdictions. Political power in rural counties often concentrates among property owners, business interests, and established families while communities experiencing the greatest health burdens have no representation in coalition governance. **If local health departments already underserve marginalized populations, regional aggregation following existing power structures will underserve them at regional scale.** Efficiency in replicating inequity does not serve transformation. Research on public health governance consistently finds community participation remains limited to information and education activities rather than planning and implementation, with communities experiencing public health as something done to them rather than with them.

RHTP subaward patterns reveal additional concerns. Population health functions often remain undefined beyond "population health infrastructure" or "surveillance capacity" without measurable outcomes, enabling activity reporting without outcome accountability. Administrative costs for coalition structures (coordination staff, meeting infrastructure, governance support) may exceed service delivery when overhead consumes significant funding portions. Community engagement requirements vary from robust to absent across states with federal guidance not mandating specific community participation structures. Sustainability planning often depends on continued aggregation, meaning if RHTP funding ends and coalition structures dissolve, the capacity they provided may disappear rather than transfer to local departments. Pass-through to local departments varies significantly, with some coalitions functioning primarily as coordinating bodies and others retaining majority funding for regional functions with limited local pass-through.

Regional public health structures contribute genuine value under specific conditions. Capacity that small departments cannot achieve alone (epidemiology, emergency preparedness, health informatics, specialized technical functions) requires expertise and infrastructure beyond individual rural department reach. Coordination across fragmented systems convenes cross-sector partners and coordinates interventions across jurisdictional boundaries. Population health data aggregation enables identification of needs and opportunities that single-county data cannot reveal. Emergency and outbreak response requires capacity that individual departments cannot maintain on standby, as COVID-19 demonstrated. Technical assistance providing training, consultation, and support strengthens local department capacity rather than substituting for it, potentially delivering more lasting value than direct service provision.

The COVID-19 pandemic stress-tested these structures and revealed both strengths and weaknesses. **Regional coordination enabled response capacity for contact tracing, testing coordination, and vaccine distribution requiring scale that individual rural departments could not achieve.** But accountability gaps became visible as communities experiencing differential pandemic impacts had no channel to influence regional response priorities. Decisions about testing site locations, vaccine distribution, and intervention strategies reflected professional judgment and logistical constraints more than community input. State-level coordination proved essential while regional approaches below state level were insufficient for emergency response. Yet local relationships remained critical, with actual pandemic response depending on community health workers, trusted local providers, and community organizations reaching populations that regional structures could not.

The recommendations require states to mandate community representation in coalition governance structures as a RHTP subaward condition, with community members holding governance positions with voting authority rather than advisory committees. **Outcome accountability specifying population health improvements rather than activity metrics should replace vague function descriptions.** Coalition overhead exceeding 25% of subaward should require justification, with assessment of whether overhead delivers proportionate value compared to direct community services. Regional coordination should strengthen rather than replace local public health presence, with subawards requiring maintenance of community-facing local services even as specialized functions aggregate regionally.

For coalitions themselves, accountability to populations rather than just member jurisdictions requires mechanisms for community input that shapes decisions rather than merely informing them, with reporting on how community priorities influenced resource allocation. **Distinguishing coordination from governance means regional structures coordinate specialized functions while preserving local governance of community-facing services.** Building local capacity rather than dependency measures success by local department capacity growth rather than coalition expansion. For CMS, requiring evidence of community voice in coalition-managed programs, monitoring accountability structures across states, and supporting alternative models that achieve aggregation without accountability loss should guide federal oversight.
