Public health districts and coalitions face a fundamental tension between **aggregation efficiency and community accountability**. Small rural health departments often lack capacity for specialized functions. They cannot maintain epidemiologists, emergency preparedness coordinators, or sophisticated data analytics independently. Multi-county districts and regional coalitions aggregate these functions, achieving scale that individual departments cannot reach.

But aggregation creates distance. Local health departments answer to local government and, through it, to local populations. Regional entities answer to boards composed of member jurisdiction representatives. These boards may reflect political structures rather than community needs. The populations most affected by public health decisions may have no direct voice in making them.

**RHTP implementation must navigate this tension carefully.** Population health improvement requires capacity that aggregation enables. But transformation should strengthen community voice, not further distance it. Regional structures that achieve efficiency while undermining accountability may not serve transformation goals even if they deliver technical functions.

## The Aggregation Efficiency

The case for aggregation rests on capacity constraints that small health departments face.

**Approximately 2,800 local health departments operate across the United States**, with governance structures varying significantly: 28% centralized under state authority, 37% decentralized under local authority, and 35% operating under combined or shared arrangements (Hyde and Shortell). This fragmentation creates enormous variation in capacity. Large urban health departments employ hundreds of staff with specialized expertise. Small rural departments may have fewer than five employees covering all functions.

**Rural health departments frequently lack specialized capacity entirely.** A three-person health department serving a 12,000-population county cannot maintain an epidemiologist, a health educator, an emergency preparedness coordinator, and administrative staff simultaneously. These departments deliver basic services but cannot perform the analytical and coordination functions that population health improvement requires.

**One in four local health departments report that their top executive is a state employee**, indicating the extent to which state structures already extend into local operations (NACCHO 2024 Forces of Change Survey). But state employment of local leaders differs from regional aggregation. State structures maintain hierarchical accountability. Regional coalitions create lateral coordination that may lack clear accountability chains.

**Scale enables expertise that small departments cannot support.** Epidemiological analysis requires training and tools that individual rural departments cannot maintain. Emergency preparedness planning requires coordination across jurisdictions that individual departments cannot achieve. Population health data analytics require technical capacity that small departments cannot afford. Regional approaches can concentrate these specialized functions while individual departments focus on community-facing services.

The efficiency argument is genuine. Some functions require scale. Pretending that every rural county can maintain comprehensive public health capacity independently ignores resource constraints that no amount of funding can fully address.

## The Accountability Distance

Against aggregation efficiency stands the accountability cost that regional structures impose.

**Local health departments answer to local government.** County commissioners, city councils, or local boards of health oversee department operations. These bodies, whatever their limitations, are elected by or accountable to local populations. Residents can attend meetings, contact representatives, and vote for different leadership if dissatisfied with public health direction.

**Regional entities answer to boards composed of member jurisdiction representatives.** These representatives may be appointed rather than elected. They may represent jurisdictional interests rather than population needs. Low-income communities, minority populations, and other groups with limited political voice may find regional structures even less accessible than local ones.

**Population health decisions affect communities without community voice.** When a regional coalition decides surveillance priorities, resource allocation, or intervention strategies, those decisions affect populations throughout the service area. But decision-making processes may not include mechanisms for community input beyond periodic needs assessments that inform rather than bind.

**The democracy deficit compounds existing inequities.** Communities with political power in member jurisdictions influence regional priorities through their representatives. Communities without such power have no channel for influence. Regional structures may reproduce and amplify the marginalization that already characterizes rural public health.

This accountability concern is not merely theoretical. Research on public health governance consistently finds that **community participation remains limited to information and education activities** rather than planning and implementation (Indian Community Health Study). Communities experience public health as something done to them rather than with them.

## Public Health Coalition Landscape

The following table examines regional public health structures across states with significant RHTP investment:

| Organization | State | Jurisdictions | Population | Staff | RHTP Role | Subaward | Accountability Structure |
|--------------|-------|---------------|------------|-------|-----------|----------|-------------------------|
| Mount Rogers Health District | Virginia | 7 counties, 4 cities | 195,000 | 85 FTE | Population health data | $3.8M | State-directed, regional board |
| Three Rivers Health District | Georgia | 10 counties | 142,000 | 62 FTE | Rural health coordination | $4.2M | District board, county appointment |
| Appalachian District Health | North Carolina | 4 counties | 185,000 | 94 FTE | Chronic disease prevention | $5.1M | District board, county commissioners |
| Delta Public Health Coalition | Mississippi | 18 counties | 320,000 | Shared staff | SDOH coordination | $6.4M | Coalition agreement, rotating chair |
| Panhandle Public Health District | Nebraska | 12 counties | 86,000 | 38 FTE | Emergency preparedness | $2.9M | Board of health, county appointment |
| Central Oregon Health Council | Oregon | 3 counties | 245,000 | 42 FTE | CCO coordination | $4.8M | CCO governance, community advisory |
| Upper Peninsula Health Coalition | Michigan | 15 counties | 302,000 | Shared staff | Behavioral health integration | $5.6M | Coalition MOU, hospital-led |

Several patterns emerge from this landscape:

**Governance structures vary significantly.** Some districts operate under state direction with regional advisory boards. Others function as coalitions of independent local departments sharing specific functions. Still others integrate with coordinated care organizations or health systems that bring different accountability structures.

**RHTP subaward allocation does not correlate with population size or need.** The Delta coalition serving 320,000 receives similar funding to a district serving 185,000. Per-capita investment varies by more than threefold across similar regional structures.

**Community voice mechanisms range from absent to advisory.** Some structures include community advisory committees. Most do not include community members in governance bodies with decision-making authority.

## Governance Scenario: The Surveillance Priority Decision

A regional public health coalition covering eight rural counties convened to establish disease surveillance priorities for RHTP implementation. The coalition had received $4.2 million for population health infrastructure, including enhanced surveillance capacity.

**The technical analysis was thorough.** Epidemiological data showed elevated rates of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and substance use disorder across the region. Cancer screening rates lagged state averages. Maternal health indicators in three counties showed concerning trends. Opioid overdose deaths had increased 40% over five years.

**Coalition staff recommended prioritizing opioid surveillance and diabetes monitoring.** These priorities reflected disease burden data and aligned with available intervention capacity. The recommendation was evidence-based, professionally defensible, and technically sound.

**Community input was limited to a public comment period.** Coalition staff presented the recommendation at a quarterly meeting. Three community members attended. One raised concerns about maternal health in her county. Staff acknowledged the concern and noted that maternal health could be incorporated in future phases.

**The coalition approved the staff recommendation without modification.** Member jurisdiction representatives, primarily county health directors and commissioners, found the epidemiological justification compelling. The surveillance priorities moved forward.

**Two years later, the maternal health situation had worsened.** The county that raised concerns experienced a maternal death that might have been prevented with earlier intervention. Community members questioned why maternal health had not been prioritized when concerns were raised. Coalition leadership pointed to the evidence-based process that had informed priorities.

**The process was efficient but not accountable.** Technical expertise drove decisions. Community voice was heard but did not shape outcomes. The surveillance system worked well for the priorities selected. It did not work for priorities the community identified but professionals did not prioritize.

## The Northeast Public Health Collaborative: A Different Model

Recent developments offer a different model of public health coalition. **The Northeast Public Health Collaborative**, formed in 2025, brings together Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Vermont to coordinate public health functions independently of federal guidance (NYC Health).

This coalition emerged from specific political circumstances as states sought to maintain evidence-based public health approaches when federal direction diverged from scientific consensus. Its structure differs from traditional regional coalitions in several ways:

**State-level participation provides clearer accountability chains.** Each participating state maintains its own democratic accountability through elected governors and legislatures. Coalition coordination does not substitute for state decision-making but supplements it.

**Voluntary participation preserves state autonomy.** States can adopt or decline coalition recommendations based on their own assessment. The coalition coordinates rather than governs.

**Public health emergency focus limits scope.** The coalition addresses specific functions including emergency preparedness, vaccine recommendations, disease surveillance, and laboratory services. It does not attempt comprehensive public health governance.

This model may offer lessons for rural regional structures. **Coordination without governance substitution** preserves local accountability while enabling capacity that individual jurisdictions cannot maintain. The question is whether voluntary coordination can achieve the efficiency gains that more integrated structures promise.

## Alternative Perspective: The Community Accountability Gap

Critics argue that **public health coalitions answer to member jurisdictions, not populations**. This accountability gap is not incidental but structural.

**Coalition boards represent jurisdictions.** Members are typically county health directors, commissioners, or appointed officials. They represent institutional interests of their jurisdictions. They may or may not represent population needs within those jurisdictions.

**Low-income and minority communities may be systematically underrepresented.** Political power in rural counties often concentrates among property owners, business interests, and established families. Communities with less political voice, including farmworkers, tribal members, recent migrants, and low-income residents, may find no representation in coalition governance even when they experience the greatest health burdens.

**Aggregation may reproduce existing inequities.** If local health departments already underserve marginalized populations, regional aggregation that follows existing power structures will underserve them at regional scale. Efficiency in replicating inequity does not serve transformation.

**Assessment: This critique is substantially valid.** Regional public health governance often lacks meaningful community voice. Advisory committees may exist, but advisory is not decisional. Public comment periods may occur, but comment is not influence. RHTP transformation should address this accountability gap, not replicate it through intermediary structures that distance services further from communities.

## RHTP Subaward Analysis

Public health coalition subawards reveal consistent patterns:

**Population health functions often remain undefined.** Subawards specify "population health infrastructure" or "surveillance capacity" without defining measurable outcomes. This vagueness enables activity reporting without outcome accountability.

**Administrative costs may exceed service delivery.** Coalition structures require coordination staff, meeting infrastructure, and governance support. When these administrative functions consume significant funding portions, resources available for actual population health services diminish.

**Community engagement requirements vary from robust to absent.** Some states require coalition governance to include community representation. Others accept jurisdiction-based governance without community voice. Federal guidance does not mandate specific community participation structures.

**Sustainability planning often depends on continued aggregation.** Coalitions may propose sustainability models that assume ongoing regional coordination. If RHTP funding ends and coalition structures dissolve, the capacity they provided may disappear rather than transfer to local departments.

**Pass-through to local departments varies significantly.** Some coalitions function primarily as coordinating bodies with most resources reaching local departments. Others retain majority funding for regional functions with limited local pass-through.

## When Public Health Coalitions Help Transformation

Regional public health structures contribute genuine value under specific conditions:

**Capacity that small departments cannot achieve alone.** Epidemiology, emergency preparedness, health informatics, and other specialized functions require expertise and infrastructure beyond individual rural department reach. Regional approaches that provide these capabilities to departments that could not otherwise access them add clear value.

**Coordination across fragmented systems.** Rural health transformation requires coordination across healthcare, social services, education, and other sectors. Regional structures can convene cross-sector partners and coordinate interventions across jurisdictional boundaries.

**Population health data and analytics.** Understanding health patterns across multi-county regions enables identification of needs and intervention opportunities that single-county data cannot reveal. Regional data aggregation, appropriately governed for privacy, supports population health management.

**Emergency and outbreak response.** Public health emergencies do not respect county boundaries. Regional coordination enables response capacity that individual departments cannot maintain on standby. COVID-19 demonstrated both the value and limitations of regional public health coordination.

**Technical assistance to local departments.** Regional structures can provide training, consultation, and support that strengthens local department capacity rather than substituting for it. This capacity-building function may deliver more lasting value than direct service provision.

## The Rural Public Health Paradox

Rural public health faces a structural paradox that regional approaches attempt but often fail to resolve.

**Rural areas have greater public health needs.** Higher rates of chronic disease, limited healthcare access, older populations, economic stress, and environmental exposures create elevated public health demands. The need for robust public health infrastructure is greater, not less, in rural areas.

**Rural areas have less public health capacity.** Tax bases are smaller, populations are dispersed, and specialized workforce is scarce. The resources available for public health infrastructure are less, not more, in rural areas.

**This paradox has no easy solution.** Aggregation attempts to address the capacity constraint by pooling resources across jurisdictions. But aggregation does not increase total resources available; it redistributes them. And it creates accountability costs that may offset efficiency gains.

**RHTP cannot resolve this paradox through regional structures alone.** Transformation funding provides temporary capacity enhancement. But if underlying resource constraints persist, transformation-era capacity will not survive funding conclusion. Regional structures built with RHTP funding may not have sustainable resource bases after 2030.

The honest assessment is that regional public health coalitions can improve efficiency with existing resources but cannot substitute for the increased public health investment that rural areas need. Expecting regional structures to achieve with better coordination what requires greater resources sets them up for failure.

## Governance Models Compared

Different states have adopted different governance models for regional public health. Understanding these variations illuminates tradeoffs:

**State-Directed Districts** operate as extensions of state health departments. Staff are state employees. Policies follow state direction. Accountability runs through state government to the governor and legislature. This model provides clear authority but may distance services from local preferences.

**Locally Governed Multi-County Districts** operate under boards composed of county appointees. Staff answer to the board rather than the state. Policies reflect board priorities. Accountability runs through board members to appointing county governments. This model preserves local authority but may create coordination challenges across jurisdictions.

**Coalition Models** bring independent local departments together for specific functions while preserving local governance for other functions. Shared staff or services address capacity constraints while individual departments maintain community relationships. This model offers flexibility but may lack clear authority for regional decisions.

**Integrated Health System Models** connect public health functions with healthcare delivery organizations, often through coordinated care organizations or accountable care organizations. This integration can align public health and clinical care but may subordinate public health priorities to healthcare system interests.

No model resolves the aggregation-accountability tension completely. Each makes different tradeoffs. States should choose models based on their specific circumstances rather than assuming any model provides universal solutions.

## When Public Health Coalitions Hinder Transformation

Regional structures impede transformation under different conditions:

**Accountability structures that exclude community voice.** When regional governance includes only jurisdiction representatives without community participation, decisions may reflect institutional interests rather than population needs. This exclusion undermines transformation's community-centered goals.

**Priorities set without population input.** Technical expertise should inform priorities but not determine them unilaterally. When epidemiological data drives decisions without community input on values and preferences, the resulting priorities may miss what communities most need.

**Efficiency gains that do not reach communities.** Regional coordination may reduce administrative duplication while not improving services that communities experience. If efficiency savings fund regional infrastructure rather than enhanced community services, transformation goals are not served.

**Distance from local needs and relationships.** Local health department staff know their communities. They maintain relationships with residents, providers, and community organizations. Regional structures may dilute these relationships, substituting professional coordination for community connection.

**Overhead absorption without outcome improvement.** Coalition structures require resources to maintain. When these resources could alternatively support direct services, coalition overhead must demonstrate value that justifies the investment. Absent outcome evidence, overhead represents potential waste.

## The COVID-19 Lesson

The COVID-19 pandemic stress-tested public health infrastructure and revealed both strengths and weaknesses of regional approaches.

**Regional coordination enabled response capacity.** Contact tracing, testing coordination, and vaccine distribution required scale that individual rural departments could not achieve. Regional structures that could mobilize quickly provided capabilities essential for pandemic response.

**Accountability gaps became visible.** Communities experiencing differential pandemic impacts often had no channel to influence regional response priorities. Decisions about testing site locations, vaccine distribution, and intervention strategies reflected professional judgment and logistical constraints more than community input.

**State-level coordination proved essential.** The Northeast Public Health Collaborative and similar state-level coordination emerged partly from pandemic experience showing that regional approaches below the state level were insufficient for emergency response while federal coordination proved unreliable.

**Local relationships remained critical.** Despite regional coordination, actual pandemic response depended on local relationships. Community health workers, trusted local providers, and community organizations reached populations that regional structures could not. The pandemic demonstrated that regional capacity complements but cannot substitute for local presence.

## Recommendations

**For States:**
Require community representation in coalition governance structures as a condition of RHTP subaward. Advisory committees are insufficient. Community members should hold governance positions with voting authority on priorities and resource allocation.

Specify outcome accountability, not just activity metrics. Coalitions should demonstrate population health improvements in the communities they serve, not just coordination activities undertaken.

Assess whether coalition overhead delivers proportionate value. Compare resource allocation between coalition infrastructure and direct community services. If overhead exceeds 25% of subaward, require justification for the investment.

Preserve local department capacity and relationships. Regional coordination should strengthen, not replace, local public health presence. Subawards should require maintenance of community-facing local services even as specialized functions aggregate regionally.

**For Coalitions:**
Demonstrate accountability to populations, not just member jurisdictions. Develop mechanisms for community input that shapes decisions rather than merely informing them. Report on how community priorities influenced resource allocation.

Distinguish coordination from governance. Regional structures should coordinate specialized functions while preserving local governance of community-facing services. Avoid mission creep that substitutes regional decision-making for local accountability.

Build local capacity rather than dependency. Technical assistance that strengthens local departments serves transformation better than regional service provision that weakens local capability. Measure success by local department capacity growth, not coalition expansion.

**For CMS:**
Require evidence of community voice in coalition-managed programs. Federal guidance should specify that regional structures demonstrate community participation in governance, not just advisory functions.

Monitor accountability structures across states. Variation in coalition governance creates variation in community voice. Federal oversight should assess whether regional approaches preserve or undermine community accountability.

Support alternative models that achieve aggregation without accountability loss. Coordination networks, shared services agreements, and other approaches may achieve capacity benefits without governance substitution. Federal guidance should encourage experimentation with structures that preserve local accountability.

## Conclusion

Public health districts and coalitions occupy a necessary but problematic position in rural health transformation. The capacity argument for aggregation is genuine. Small rural health departments cannot independently maintain the specialized functions that population health improvement requires. Regional approaches that provide epidemiology, emergency preparedness, data analytics, and coordination capacity add real value.

But the accountability argument against aggregation is equally genuine. Regional governance that excludes community voice makes decisions affecting populations without their input. The democracy deficit that characterizes many regional structures undermines transformation's community-centered goals.

**RHTP implementation should not accept this tradeoff as inevitable.** Aggregation and accountability need not be opposites. Regional structures can include community governance. Coordination can preserve local decision-making. Capacity-building can strengthen rather than replace local presence.

The question for states is whether their regional public health structures achieve both efficiency and accountability, or whether they sacrifice the latter for the former. Transformation requires both. Structures that deliver capacity without community voice may improve population health metrics while failing to transform the relationship between public health and communities it serves.
