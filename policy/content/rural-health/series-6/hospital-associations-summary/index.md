The Rural Health Transformation Program channels billions through hospital associations on an assumption that may not withstand scrutiny: that organizations built to protect member interests can simultaneously drive transformation threatening those interests. Texas sends $14 million to the Texas Organization of Rural and Community Hospitals for financial analysis and technical assistance. Kentucky allocates $8 million to its hospital association for workforce development. Georgia contracts $11 million for quality improvement coordination. These arrangements assume hospital associations know their members, command their trust, and can guide them through difficult changes. The structural question is whether organizations whose boards comprise member hospital executives, whose revenues depend on member dues, and whose identity centers on hospital advocacy can genuinely advance transformation goals requiring some hospitals to close, others to surrender autonomy, and all to accept fundamental change.

Hospital associations exist because individual rural hospitals lack resources for sustained policy advocacy, sophisticated data analysis, or comprehensive technical assistance. The governance structure reinforces member primacy through boards of hospital CEOs and administrators expecting representation of their interests. **Revenue structures deepen member dependence**, with membership dues constituting the core funding base supplemented by conference fees, group purchasing arrangements, and consulting services. Board members facing financial distress want advocacy for enhanced reimbursement, not analysis suggesting facility closure. Board members investing in service expansion want support, not questions about regional need. The advocacy function represents associations' most visible activity, with state hospital associations maintaining lobbyists, developing legislative priorities, and mobilizing members for political action. The Texas Organization of Rural and Community Hospitals publishes detailed legislative priorities including enhanced Medicaid reimbursement and rural hospital grant funding. The Kentucky Hospital Association advocates for state investments in rural hospital viability. Georgia's hospital association coordinates the HEART rural hospital tax credit program channeling over $400 million to rural hospitals since 2017.

This advocacy work creates relationships and credibility that associations bring to RHTP implementation. Legislators trust association data, state agencies rely on association expertise, and hospitals view associations as champions. The question is whether advocacy relationships can coexist with transformation honesty. When association analysis reveals that a member hospital should close, does the relationship enable difficult conversations or prevent them? RHTP invests $50 billion to transform rural health, not merely sustain existing arrangements. The program logic assumes current rural health infrastructure is inadequate and requires fundamental change. Rural Emergency Hospital conversions represent the clearest example. Congress created the REH designation recognizing that some Critical Access Hospitals cannot sustain full inpatient services but should maintain emergency and outpatient capabilities. As of January 2026, 42 hospitals have converted nationwide, with many more evaluating conversion. **Hospital associations have responded ambivalently to REH development**, advocating for improved reimbursement and regulatory clarity while rarely proactively counseling members toward conversion. The decision to recommend that a member close its inpatient unit conflicts with the advocacy identity viewing hospital closure as failure.

Regional network development presents similar tensions. RHTP encourages hub and spoke arrangements where larger facilities provide specialty services while smaller facilities handle primary and emergency care. These arrangements can strengthen regional systems but reduce individual hospital autonomy. Hospital associations have advocated for flexible network arrangements preserving member autonomy, resisting models requiring facilities to cede services to hub institutions. **The preference for voluntary coordination over directed integration reflects member interests in maintaining independence**, even when directed integration might produce better community outcomes. Workforce strategies create direct conflicts when concentrating specialists at hub facilities rather than distributing them across all hospitals. If regional cardiologists practice at the hub, smaller hospitals lose recruitment battles they were already losing. Associations generally advocate for workforce approaches benefiting all members, which may mean less effective approaches overall.

The Riverside Community Hospital case (name changed) illustrates the transformation dilemma directly. This 25 bed Critical Access Hospital in West Texas was losing $180,000 monthly when CEO Maria Gonzalez requested TORCH assistance in late 2024. Three years of operating losses had depleted reserves, medical staff had declined from 12 active physicians to 4 averaging 63 years old, and the hospital maintained obstetric services averaging 3 deliveries per month requiring on call coverage exhausting remaining staff. TORCH's financial analysis was unambiguous: Riverside could not sustain current operations. Inpatient utilization had declined 40% over five years as county population aged and younger residents relocated. The analysis identified three options, with conversion to Rural Emergency Hospital status representing the most sustainable path, maintaining emergency and outpatient services while eliminating inpatient care and reducing losses to approximately $40,000 monthly with enhanced REH reimbursement. **What TORCH did not do was clearly recommend conversion**. The presentation framed conversion as one option among others despite analysis showing it as the only sustainable path. Board members wanting to preserve the hospital's traditional role found no clear guidance pushing toward difficult decisions.

Riverside's board voted to continue operations while pursuing community fundraising. Six months later, facing deepening losses and failed fundraising, the board revisited conversion after two physicians retired, emergency department volumes declined further, and conversion financial projections had worsened. The delay cost the community options. Had TORCH clearly recommended conversion when analysis supported it, Riverside might have transitioned with stronger financial position and better physician coverage. **TORCH staff members acknowledged the tension confidentially**: their job is to help hospitals, sometimes meaning telling hard truths, but they remain accountable to a board of hospital CEOs who do not want to hear that peers should close services. There exists pressure, spoken and unspoken, to present options rather than recommendations.

State approaches to hospital association RHTP subawards reveal different assumptions about the member advocacy tension. Texas channels $14.2 million through TORCH for financial analysis, technical assistance, and data with 35% pass-through to hospitals and activity-based accountability metrics. Georgia allocates $11.4 million for quality improvement and HEART coordination with 28% pass-through and quality measure accountability. Kentucky provides $8.1 million for workforce pipeline development with 42% pass-through and training completion metrics. Mississippi assigns $9.3 million for conversion support with 31% pass-through and metrics counting conversions facilitated rather than sustainable decisions made. **Pass-through percentages indicate how much subaward funding reaches hospitals versus being retained by associations for administrative costs and staff**, with variation revealing different implementation models. Outcome accountability structures range from weak to moderate, with no examined state requiring associations to demonstrate transformation outcomes as opposed to transformation activities. Texas tracks technical assistance sessions delivered and hospital satisfaction, not whether assisted hospitals actually transformed. This accountability gap reflects the member service tension, as state agencies requiring associations to demonstrate transformation outcomes create pressure for associations to push members toward change. Associations resist outcome accountability precisely because it would require advocacy-limiting honesty.

The Upper Peninsula Health Network in Michigan illustrates how hospital association advocacy shapes RHTP implementation protecting members while potentially undermining transformation. Michigan's RHTP application proposed regional networks with clear hub and spoke designations identifying larger hospitals as hubs responsible for specialty services, complex care, and workforce concentration, while smaller hospitals would serve as spokes providing primary care, emergency stabilization, and transfer coordination. The network structure required spokes to forgo certain service development in favor of regional efficiency. The Michigan Hospital Association raised concerns during application development as several member hospitals designated as spokes objected to restrictions on their service development, wanting to maintain options for future service expansion even if current utilization did not support those services. **The transformation from mandatory to voluntary network structure preserved member autonomy** at the cost of network clarity. Two years into network implementation, supposed spoke hospitals had independently recruited cardiologists competing with hub services, with one spoke hospital investing in intensive care capabilities duplicating hub capacity. Network coordination meetings became contentious as hospitals defended independent decisions undermining regional planning.

Hospital associations contribute genuine transformation value under specific conditions. Peer learning facilitation represents associations' clearest value-add, as hospitals seeing peers successfully navigate transformation become more willing to consider change. TORCH's REH peer network connects converted hospitals with facilities considering conversion, providing practical guidance and emotional support reducing conversion anxiety. Technical assistance on discrete tasks draws on association expertise without requiring advocacy-challenging recommendations, helping hospitals understand REH conversion requirements, navigate regulatory processes, and implement operational changes. Data aggregation and benchmarking provide hospitals information for self-assessment, with TORCH's hospital dashboard allowing rural Texas hospitals to compare performance against peers, identifying improvement opportunities without association staff making explicit recommendations. **Policy advocacy for transformation-enabling policies** aligns member interests with transformation goals through enhanced REH reimbursement, flexible network regulations, and workforce support.

The same structural features enabling association value-add can obstruct transformation. Protection of members that should close or convert reflects the core tension, with advocacy identity preventing clear recommendations when association analysis identifies hospitals that cannot sustain current operations. Advocacy against regional consolidation reflects member preference for autonomy over efficiency. Technical assistance focused on member survival rather than community need substitutes hospital-centered for community-centered analysis, perpetuating facilities no longer serving community interests. Capture of transformation funding for member services redirects RHTP investment from transformation to sustainability when associations interpret transformation broadly enough to include any hospital support.

Evidence from RHTP implementation suggests the member service imperative genuinely constrains transformation honesty, as associations rarely proactively recommend facility closure or service elimination even when analysis supports those conclusions. Association relationships enable transformation conversations that would not otherwise
