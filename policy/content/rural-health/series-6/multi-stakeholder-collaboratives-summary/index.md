The Rural Health Transformation Program encounters a fundamental challenge in its multi-stakeholder collaborative structures. These collaboratives, designed to bring diverse voices to rural health decisions, often function as coordination theater rather than genuine democratic engagement. The distinction between including community members and giving them actual influence determines whether these structures serve transformation or merely legitimize predetermined provider priorities.

**CMS has explicitly encouraged stakeholder engagement** across RHTP implementation, expecting states to conduct robust processes gathering diverse input. Alaska's Department of Health received stakeholder responses spanning care delivery integration, behavioral health, and Indigenous Traditional Healing. California engaged providers, county governments, community organizations, health plans, and academic institutions. Georgia documented 169 responses addressing workforce development and community partnerships. These extensive engagement efforts represent genuine attempts at inclusive governance, yet inclusion does not guarantee influence.

The structural advantages favoring provider participation create systematic imbalances. **Health systems employ staff whose job descriptions include stakeholder engagement**, enabling consistent meeting attendance, sophisticated proposal preparation, and sustained relationship building across multiple collaborative bodies. Community members face opposite constraints. Single mothers working multiple jobs cannot attend afternoon planning meetings. Farmworkers without paid leave cannot participate in multi-day stakeholder processes. Senior citizens without reliable transportation cannot reach regional gatherings. The populations transformation should most benefit encounter the highest barriers to meaningful participation.

Technical vocabulary compounds these structural imbalances. Healthcare professionals speak fluently about quality metrics, payment models, regulatory compliance, and clinical protocols. Community members may struggle to translate lived experience into terms that professionals recognize as legitimate contributions. When discussion occurs in professional vocabulary, community voices become marginalized even when community members are physically present. The language itself functions as exclusion mechanism.

**Agenda control determines outcomes more than participation numbers.** The entity setting meeting agendas, defining options for consideration, and framing questions constrains possible outcomes before community members see proposals. These process decisions typically fall to professional staff or executive leadership. By the time community members evaluate options, the range of possibilities has narrowed to choices providers find acceptable. Information asymmetry reinforces this pattern. Hospitals understand their financial constraints, operational challenges, and strategic priorities. Community members may not know what questions to ask, what information to request, or how to evaluate provider claims.

Analysis of collaborative structures across states with significant RHTP investment reveals consistent patterns. The Georgia Rural Health Innovation Center operates with board governance allocating eight provider seats and three community seats, managing a $12.4 million budget with provider-dominated power dynamics. The Texas Rural Health Coalition uses coalition agreements giving providers twelve seats against four community seats. California's Rural Health Collaborative structures fifteen provider representatives and six community members in an advisory role. Most collaborative governance includes more institutional representatives than community representatives, and even numerically balanced structures often produce provider-dominated outcomes when providers control preparation resources and agenda setting.

**Community-influenced structures remain exceptional.** The Mississippi Delta Health Collaborative operates with community-led governance allocating four provider seats and eight community seats across a $6.8 million budget. New Mexico's Community Health Councils structure three provider representatives and nine community members with community-influenced power distribution. These collaboratives achieve different dynamics, yet they represent minority approaches. Larger collaborative budgets tend to accompany stronger provider influence, potentially reflecting either provider capacity to secure resources or funder preference for professionally-managed structures.

The distinction between participation and influence becomes visible in specific scenarios. A Mountain West collaborative convened to recommend RHTP investment priorities included hospital executives, clinic administrators, public health officials, social service directors, and four community members recruited through outreach. The hospital CEO proposed telehealth infrastructure investment with professional cost projections, outcome estimates, and implementation timelines addressing genuine specialty care access needs. A community member raised transportation concerns, noting that elderly neighbors sometimes could not reach hospitals 45 minutes away. Telehealth would not help people unable to reach clinics with telehealth equipment.

**Discussion focused on the professionally prepared telehealth proposal.** Provider representatives asked clarifying questions, suggested modifications, and expressed support. The transportation concern received acknowledgment but no follow-up questions. Staff noted that transportation could be considered in future phases. The collaborative recommended telehealth investment as the priority with transportation mentioned as secondary consideration. Both stakeholders participated, yet only one voice shaped outcomes. The community member had been present, had spoken, and had been acknowledged, but structures of preparation, information, and professional vocabulary prevented her concern from competing with the hospital's proposal.

A Southern state implemented a contrasting approach. Rather than creating a statewide collaborative with community representation, it funded regional community health councils with majority community membership. Each council seated nine members including six community residents and three provider representatives. **Community members received compensation for participation.** Meetings occurred evenings and weekends with childcare provided. Translation services enabled non-English speaker participation. Councils identified priorities through community dialogue processes rather than reviewing professional proposals, convening community conversations about health needs while staff synthesized themes for council consideration.

Transportation emerged as the top priority across multiple regions. Community members consistently identified getting to care as more pressing than what happened upon arrival. Provider representatives initially questioned this priority but deferred to community judgment. The resulting RHTP plan prioritized transportation solutions including volunteer driver networks, transit agency coordination, and mobile health services bringing care to communities rather than leading with telehealth infrastructure. Outcomes remain to be demonstrated, yet the process achieved something typical collaboratives do not: community priorities shaped resource allocation rather than ratifying provider preferences.

Defenders of multi-stakeholder collaboratives argue that imperfect participation exceeds no participation. Without collaborative structures, transformation decisions would occur through state agencies and providers without any community input mechanism. Collaboratives often constitute the only structures including all stakeholders, creating forums that rural communities typically lack for convening providers, public health, social services, and residents together. **Building community voice requires time.** Community members unfamiliar with healthcare policy need opportunities to develop vocabulary, relationships, and confidence for effective participation. Early meetings may be provider-dominated, but sustained engagement can shift power dynamics over time.

This defense carries partial validity. Collaboratives can include community voice, and inclusion exceeds exclusion. The defense understates the difference between inclusion and influence, however. Structures including community voice without granting power provide legitimacy for provider priorities while claiming democratic participation. This legitimization function may be worse than no collaborative when it enables providers to claim community support for decisions communities did not shape.

Collaborative subaward patterns illuminate the inclusion versus influence distinction. Community member compensation varies from absent to adequate. Some collaboratives provide no compensation while others provide stipends, childcare, transportation, and support enabling participation. **Decision-making authority versus advisory function determines influence.** Collaboratives with authority to allocate resources or approve plans differ fundamentally from those advising state agencies retaining decision authority. Advisory bodies can be ignored while decision-making structures require engagement. Staff accountability structures shape whose interests staff serve. Collaborative staff employed by hospitals may prioritize employer interests while staff employed by neutral entities balance interests differently.

Meeting logistics reveal participation design intentions. Evening meetings in community locations with translation services and childcare provision indicate design for community participation. Weekday meetings in professional settings without support services indicate design for provider convenience. Documentation of community influence matters most. Collaboratives should demonstrate how community input changed priorities. Final recommendations closely matching initial provider proposals despite community participation suggest inclusion produced legitimacy rather than influence.

Sherry Arnstein's participation ladder framework distinguishes meaningful engagement categories. **Manipulation and therapy constitute non-participation**, with activities labeled as participation actually aiming to educate participants or cure concerns. Informing, consultation, and placation represent tokenism where community members receive information and provide feedback but power remains with professionals choosing whether to act. Partnership, delegated power, and citizen control represent genuine citizen power where community members share decision authority, control specific decisions, or hold majority governance power.

Most rural health collaboratives operate at tokenism levels. Community members are informed and consulted, possibly holding advisory positions, yet decision authority remains with professionals, state agencies, or provider-dominated boards. Transformation requires moving toward citizen power. If community voice is to shape transformation priorities, community members need actual authority beyond participation opportunities. This shift requires structural change, not merely better facilitation. The distinction matters because tokenism consumes community time and goodwill without delivering influence. Community members participating repeatedly without seeing input affect decisions will eventually disengage.

Authentic community participation requires capacity that may not exist initially. Rural communities may lack organized representation that urban areas possess through community organizations, advocacy groups, and civic associations. Historical exclusion creates participation barriers. Communities systematically excluded from decision-making may distrust collaborative processes, requiring demonstrated commitment over time. Representation challenges emerge around who legitimately speaks for communities holding diverse perspectives. Capacity building takes time as community members unfamiliar with healthcare policy need opportunities to learn context, vocabulary, and processes.

These challenges do not justify abandoning community participation. They require realistic expectations and sustained investment. Collaboratives should build community capacity over time rather than expecting immediate sophisticated engagement. States should consider investing in community organizing and capacity building as preconditions for effective participation. Without this investment, community seats may remain unfilled or filled by unrepresentative participants.

**Accountability ultimately determines collaborative effectiveness.** Provider-dominated collaboratives are accountable to provider interests. When hospitals and health systems control governance, collaboratives serve provider goals. This becomes problematic when provider and community goals diverge. Community-led collaboratives are accountable to community priorities, al
