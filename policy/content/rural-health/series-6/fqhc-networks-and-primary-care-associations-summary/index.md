Primary Care Associations enter the Rural Health Transformation Program carrying an asset that hospital associations and consulting firms cannot replicate: decades of trust with Federally Qualified Health Centers. When a health center executive needs guidance on HRSA compliance, operational challenges, or strategic direction, they call their PCA. When policy changes threaten the safety net, PCAs advocate. This consistent presence has built relationships that transform transactional arrangements into genuine partnerships, creating **legitimacy that enables transformation conversations other intermediaries cannot initiate**. Health centers share financial struggles, governance problems, and operational concerns with PCA staff that they would never disclose to state regulators or external consultants. This information flow allows PCAs to identify problems early and provide assistance before crises develop.

Yet legitimacy and capacity do not correlate. The 54 state and regional PCAs vary enormously in organizational sophistication. California's Primary Care Association operates with 65 staff and an $18 million annual budget. Nevada's PCA functions with 6 staff on $1.4 million. Both carry HRSA funding and similar formal responsibilities, but their ability to deliver differs by an order of magnitude. **When RHTP routes $50 billion in transformation funding through intermediaries whose credibility exceeds their capabilities**, the gap between what PCAs are trusted to do and what they can actually deliver shapes implementation outcomes in ways state agencies consistently fail to anticipate.

The staffing disparities create predictable technical assistance gaps. Well-resourced PCAs employ clinical quality specialists, health IT experts, financial analysts, and workforce development coordinators. Smaller PCAs rely on generalists covering multiple functions without deep expertise in any. When RHTP demands sophisticated technical assistance on behavioral health integration, telehealth implementation, or care model redesign, PCAs without relevant expertise cannot deliver regardless of their relationships. Many PCAs have never managed transformation programs at RHTP scale. HRSA cooperative agreements fund training, technical assistance, and advocacy, not major capital investments or system redesign. Organizations accustomed to supporting health centers through regulatory compliance may lack experience guiding fundamental operational transformation.

The West Virginia case illustrates how legitimacy can mask capacity limitations with consequences for transformation timelines. The state's Primary Care Association had served health centers for 28 years, maintaining strong relationships with all 31 FQHCs. With 14 staff and a $2.3 million budget, the PCA had built trust that enabled frank conversations about challenges other providers would hide. When West Virginia's RHTP designated the PCA as lead intermediary for safety-net transformation, **the $5.8 million subaward represented 2.5 times the organization's existing annual budget**. The transformation scope included care model redesign, behavioral health integration, telehealth expansion, and workforce pipeline development.

Year one exposed the capacity gaps. The PCA had no staff with behavioral health integration expertise despite this being a major priority. Telehealth technical assistance fell to a generalist who had never implemented telehealth systems. Workforce pipeline coordination required relationships with educational institutions that the PCA had not cultivated. The organization responded by hiring, but rural West Virginia proved an unattractive labor market for health policy professionals. After nine months, only two of five new positions were filled, both with candidates requiring substantial onboarding before delivering technical assistance. Meanwhile, health centers expected transformation support the PCA could not provide. Cabin Creek Health Center wanted guidance on integrating psychiatric services into primary care, but the PCA's new behavioral health consultant was still learning the state landscape. Minnie Hamilton Health System sought telehealth implementation support, but received only general resources without hands-on assistance.

**The legitimacy relationship that enabled the subaward became the relationship that masked its limitations.** Health center executives, accustomed to trusting the PCA, assumed support quality matched their historical experience. When transformation assistance proved inadequate, they attributed shortcomings to transformation complexity rather than PCA capacity gaps. State agency oversight measured activities rather than effectiveness: technical assistance sessions delivered, webinars conducted, resource materials distributed. By year two, implementation delays had accumulated. Health centers that should have launched behavioral health integration remained in planning phases. Telehealth expansion proceeded slower than projected. Workforce pipelines showed limited progress. The relationships remained strong and trust persisted, but transformation lagged behind what capacity-matched implementation might have achieved.

The strongest counterargument holds that RHTP should invest in building PCA capacity rather than routing funding through organizations with capability but without relationships. This approach trades short-term implementation speed for long-term institutional development. Several states have adopted capacity building strategies. Texas combined PCA subawards with dedicated investments funding new positions and professional development that expanded transformation capabilities. California used RHTP resources to strengthen technical assistance infrastructure, adding specialists in areas where transformation required expertise the PCA previously lacked. States that invested in PCA capacity building report improved technical assistance quality over time, with health centers indicating higher satisfaction than those working with external consultants who arrive, deliver, and disappear when contracts end.

The tension is temporal. **Capacity building takes time that transformation timelines may not allow.** RHTP operates on a five-year horizon with the 2030 Medicaid funding cliff creating hard deadlines. PCAs that require two years of capacity building before delivering effective transformation support have consumed 40 percent of the program period. The question becomes whether states can afford the legitimacy benefits of PCA involvement if capacity development delays transformation implementation beyond sustainable timelines.

Analysis of RHTP subaward patterns reveals how rarely states assess capacity before assigning scope. California conducted formal organizational capacity reviews before finalizing subaward amounts, adjusting scopes to match demonstrated abilities. Most states conducted no documented capacity assessment, assuming that PCA legitimacy translated to transformation capacity. Pass-through percentages for PCAs typically exceed hospital association levels, reflecting PCA emphasis on direct health center support rather than retained administrative services. Higher pass-through means more funding reaches providers, though it may also reflect lower PCA investment in technical assistance infrastructure. **Subaward amounts often exceed what organizational capacity can effectively deploy.** Nevada's PCA received a $2 million RHTP subaward that nearly doubled the organization's existing budget, straining administrative systems and diverting attention from core functions.

Colorado's approach demonstrates how capacity matching can improve implementation without sacrificing all legitimacy benefits. State agency staff conducted explicit assessment of the Colorado Community Health Network before designing PCA roles, reviewing staffing, technical expertise, program management experience, and historical performance. The assessment identified strengths in quality improvement and moderate capacity in workforce development, but weak behavioral health integration capability and minimal telehealth expertise. **Colorado designed the subaward scope to match demonstrated capacity**, giving CCHN $6.2 million focused on quality improvement coordination and workforce pipeline development while contracting separately with behavioral health consultants and telehealth implementation specialists for functions exceeding CCHN capability.

This approach sacrificed some legitimacy benefits. Health centers working with external consultants on behavioral health integration lacked the trusted relationship they had with CCHN. Some executives expressed preference for working with the PCA even on topics where it lacked expertise, preferring guidance from a trusted partner over superior guidance from strangers. Yet implementation results supported capacity matching. Quality improvement initiatives led by CCHN showed strong engagement and measurable outcome improvements. Behavioral health integration supported by external consultants progressed faster than in states relying on under-resourced PCAs despite relationship challenges. Overall transformation achievement exceeded states that prioritized legitimacy over capacity. Health center satisfaction with CCHN support increased because the PCA delivered effectively on committed functions rather than inadequately on overcommitted scope.

PCAs face additional complexity through dual accountability to HRSA and state agencies. HRSA expects PCAs to serve all health centers regardless of membership status, reflecting federal interest in safety-net strengthening broadly rather than just for PCA-affiliated centers. RHTP subawards add state accountability without removing HRSA requirements. When state transformation priorities diverge from federal program expectations, **PCAs face conflicting demands from their federal funder and state contractor**. This accountability complexity affects transformation focus as organizational energy flows toward activities satisfying the most demanding funder, which may not be the transformation funder. Many PCAs also serve as Health Center Controlled Networks providing health information technology support with separate HRSA funding and distinct requirements that may or may not align with RHTP transformation priorities.

Despite these complications, PCAs contribute genuine transformation value under specific conditions. Technical assistance on FQHC-specific challenges draws on expertise that general health consultants lack, addressing health center transformation within the regulatory context these organizations actually face. Peer learning facilitation leverages PCA convening power in ways that build transformation momentum across networks. Policy advocacy for transformation-enabling changes helps remove barriers that individual health centers cannot address alone. Relationship-based change management provides emotional support through difficult transitions, with **PCA staff understanding health center context, sharing their values, and providing encouragement alongside technical guidance** that helps sustain transformation effort through inevitable setbacks.

The same legitimacy can obstruct transformation when capacity proves insufficient. Over-promising based on relationship rather than capability creates implementation gaps as PCAs take on responsibilities they cannot fulfill. Technical assistance diluted by generalist staffing provides guidance without depth, checking boxes without building transformation capability.
