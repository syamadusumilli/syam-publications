        <p><em><strong>What happens to identity when everything that used to define us can
be outsourced?</strong></em></p>
<p>I've been thinking about children growing up right now&mdash;kids who will
be teenagers when AI has fully arrived, adults when its implications
have settled into ordinary life. What will they learn? What will they
strive for? What will they remember about growing up?</p>
<p>The questions sound pedagogical. They're actually existential. We're
not really asking about curriculum or teaching methods. We're asking
what a human life is for when the structures that used to answer that
question dissolve.</p>
<h1 id="the-scaffold-falls" class="relative group">The Scaffold Falls <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#the-scaffold-falls" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h1><p>For most of human history, survival answered the question of what to do
with your life. You farmed because you'd starve otherwise. You learned
your father's trade because there was no alternative. You stayed in
your village because leaving meant death. The brutal logic of necessity
provided structure, meaning, identity. You were a farmer, a blacksmith,
a weaver&mdash;not because you chose it but because the world demanded it.</p>
<p>Then modernity offered a different structure: achievement. The
industrial economy needed workers who could follow instructions, do
arithmetic, parse texts. Schools became factories producing standardized
humans for standardized jobs. And a new life script emerged&mdash;climb the
ladder, get credentials, build a career. The meaning of your life could
be measured by how far you rose from where you started.</p>
<p>This structure was real. Degrees proved you could learn things. Titles
proved your place in hierarchy. Salaries quantified your worth. Cities
gave you access to opportunity. Skills demonstrated competence. Most of
us built our identities on this scaffolding without even realizing it
was scaffolding&mdash;it felt like reality itself.</p>
<p>But what happens when a child with an AI companion can access any
knowledge instantly, solve any problem effortlessly, and produce work
that exceeds what most professionals spent decades learning to create?</p>
<p>The scaffold doesn't just shake. It dissolves.</p>
<p>Degrees prove you could learn things&mdash;but AI learns better and faster
than any human. Careers prove you could do things&mdash;but AI does more, in
more domains, with fewer errors. Skills demonstrate competence&mdash;but
competence is increasingly outsourced. Cities provide opportunity&mdash;but
opportunity travels by fiber optic cable, arriving anywhere with a
connection. Titles prove your place in hierarchy&mdash;but hierarchy of
what, exactly, when the work that justified the hierarchy is performed
by machines?</p>
<p>Strip all of this away from a person's identity and ask: what's left?</p>
<p>This is not a hypothetical question. It's the question every child born
today will have to answer.</p>
<h1 id="the-question-only-aristocrats-had" class="relative group">The Question Only Aristocrats Had <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#the-question-only-aristocrats-had" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h1><p>Here's what we're not saying out loud: most humans have never had to
answer this question.</p>
<p>Throughout history, only a tiny sliver of humanity faced it
directly&mdash;aristocrats whose survival was secured by inherited wealth,
monks who renounced worldly striving for spiritual practice,
philosophers who made questioning the meaning of life their life's
work. Everyone else was too busy surviving to wonder what survival was
for.</p>
<p>We can see the evidence today in who struggles most with meaning. Trust
fund kids often drift, despite having every advantage&mdash;everything
provided, nothing required. Retirees frequently decline rapidly after
leaving work, their identity so fused with their job that its absence
feels like death. Lottery winners are statistically more miserable after
their windfall than before, the sudden removal of financial necessity
revealing an emptiness they didn't know was there. The credentialed
unemployed&mdash;people who did everything right, got the degrees, followed
the script&mdash;find themselves devastated not just economically but
existentially when the script fails them.</p>
<p>These people aren't lazy or ungrateful. They're unmoored. The
structure that gave life meaning dissolved, and nothing replaced it.</p>
<p>Now imagine that for everyone. Imagine a whole generation growing up
without the scaffolding of necessity, without the script of achievement,
facing the question that only the leisured classes once faced: if you
don't have to do anything, what do you do? If achievement doesn't
define you, what does?</p>
<p>This is the inheritance we're preparing for children born today.</p>
<h1 id="why-learn-anything" class="relative group">Why Learn Anything? <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#why-learn-anything" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h1><p>Consider the subjects we've told children they must learn. Physics.
Mathematics. History. Literature. For decades we've offered
instrumental justifications&mdash;you need these for jobs, for understanding
the world, for training your mind.</p>
<p>But examine each justification honestly and watch it crumble.</p>
<p>&quot;You need math for jobs.&quot; But the jobs that required mathematical
competence are exactly the jobs AI will transform first. The accountant,
the engineer, the data analyst&mdash;these roles will be augmented or
replaced long before the gardener or the therapist.</p>
<p>&quot;You need math to understand the world.&quot; But understanding that the
universe runs on mathematical principles doesn't require you to
manipulate symbols yourself. An AI can show you, explain the beauty of
it, make it visceral and real&mdash;without you ever solving an equation.</p>
<p>&quot;Math trains your mind.&quot; This is the classic defense, but the evidence
for transfer is weak. Chess masters aren't better general reasoners
than non-players. Math PhDs aren't wiser about life than poets. The
skills we develop tend to stay in their domains.</p>
<p>&quot;Math protects you from being fooled.&quot; This one has teeth&mdash;numeracy
as defense against manipulation, the ability to spot statistical lies.
But you need far less math for this than we currently teach, and an AI
can serve as your bullshit detector anyway.</p>
<p>So why would a child spend years learning calculus? The honest answer
might be: only if it calls to them. Only if the elegance of mathematics
speaks to something in their soul, the way music speaks to some people
and leaves others cold.</p>
<p>And this isn't just true of math. Why memorize historical dates you can
access instantly? Why learn to write essays when AI writes better ones?
Why study biology, economics, literature as a requirement rather than a
choice?</p>
<p>The instrumental answers collapse one by one. What remains are the
intrinsic ones: learn what genuinely calls to you, what makes you more
fully who you are, what you would pursue even if it offered no practical
advantage.</p>
<p>This sounds liberating. It's also terrifying. Because most of us never
had to discover what genuinely called to us. The requirements told us
what to do. The script provided direction. Without it, we have to find
our own.</p>
<h1 id="the-irreducible-curriculum" class="relative group">The Irreducible Curriculum <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#the-irreducible-curriculum" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h1><p>But something must remain that cannot be outsourced&mdash;skills or
capacities that are irreducibly human, that AI cannot perform for us no
matter how capable it becomes. What are they?</p>
<p>First: knowing what you want. AI can optimize, but optimize for what?
The child who knows their own values, desires, and sense of meaning can
direct AI toward genuine flourishing. The child who doesn't becomes a
vessel for other people's goals, or worse, for aimless optimization
toward nothing. Self-knowledge&mdash;understanding what you actually want,
not what you've been told to want&mdash;might be the most important
capacity to develop, and it cannot be outsourced because it can only be
discovered from the inside.</p>
<p>Second: making meaning from experience. AI can explain grief. Only you
can grieve. AI can describe what loss feels like. Only you can feel it.
The interpretation of your own life&mdash;what it means, what matters, what
the suffering was for&mdash;this is irreducibly yours. No machine can do
your meaning-making for you.</p>
<p>Third: judgment under uncertainty. Not calculation, which AI wins
easily, but the kind of practical wisdom that says this is the right
thing to do here, now, for these people, in this unrepeatable situation.
The Greeks called it phronesis. It cannot be formalized into rules,
which means it cannot be automated. It can only be cultivated through
experience, reflection, and the accumulation of lived situations.</p>
<p>Fourth: witnessing. Being present with another person in their joy or
suffering. This can never be outsourced because it requires a human
being there, attending, caring. And it might be the most valuable thing
humans do for each other&mdash;more valuable than any information we could
provide or problem we could solve.</p>
<p>Fifth: physical embodiment. AI can describe swimming. Only you can swim.
The body is the one domain that cannot be delegated. When everything
cognitive can be outsourced, what remains irreducibly yours is what you
can do with your muscles, your senses, your physical presence in the
world.</p>
<p>These might constitute the real curriculum&mdash;not subjects to be studied
but capacities to be developed. And notably, they look almost nothing
like what we currently teach in schools.</p>
<h1 id="do-you-need-to-do-things" class="relative group">Do You Need to Do Things? <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#do-you-need-to-do-things" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h1><p>What about practical skills&mdash;cooking, farming, cleaning, driving,
building? The instrumental answer is no. AI and robotics will do all of
these better than you ever could. More efficiently. More safely. More
cheaply. The economic logic that once required these skills is
evaporating.</p>
<p>So why would anyone learn?</p>
<p>One answer is resilience. Systems fail. Power goes out. Supply chains
break. Knowing how to feed yourself when the robots stop might matter.
But this is a weak argument on examination&mdash;you could learn
just-in-time if needed, enough people will retain these skills to help
you, and the failures will likely be brief.</p>
<p>A deeper answer comes from an unexpected source: the Amish.</p>
<p>The Amish don't reject technology out of ignorance. They're well aware
of what they're refusing. They reject it because of who they want to
become. They believe certain practices form certain kinds of
people&mdash;that farming by hand creates community and humility, that
constraints can be chosen deliberately for the sake of character. They
accept cars' efficiency but reject what car ownership does to village
life. They accept electricity's convenience but reject what it does to
the rhythm of days.</p>
<p>This is a profound idea: that we might choose constraints not because we
must but because of who we want to be.</p>
<p>Maybe in 2045, some humans will cook not because they have to but
because the practice of cooking&mdash;the smells, the patience, the
creativity, the feeding of others&mdash;shapes them into who they want to
be. Maybe some will garden not for efficiency but for the contact with
soil, seasons, the slow time of growing things. Maybe some will build
with their hands not because robots can't do it better but because
there's something in the making that can't be delegated.</p>
<p>When everything cognitive can be outsourced, the body becomes the last
domain of authentic selfhood. The things you do with your hands. The
skills in your muscles. The knowledge that lives in your nerves, not
your notes.</p>
<p>Not &quot;I know things&quot;&mdash;AI knows more. Not &quot;I achieved things&quot;&mdash;AI
achieved more. But &quot;I can do this with my body, and it's mine.&quot;</p>
<p>This might sound like regression, a retreat from the life of the mind to
mere physical existence. But maybe we had it backwards. Maybe the life
of the mind was always dependent on the life of the body, and we forgot
this because mental labor paid better. When that economic logic
dissolves, we might remember what we always were: embodied creatures for
whom thinking was only one part of being.</p>
<h1 id="do-you-need-to-live-in-a-city" class="relative group">Do You Need to Live in a City? <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#do-you-need-to-live-in-a-city" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h1><p>Cities have dominated human life for centuries because of what they
provided: jobs clustered there, networks formed there, services
concentrated there, culture flourished there. The ambitious moved to
cities because that's where opportunity lived.</p>
<p>But each of these reasons is weakening. Work becomes remote and
AI-assisted, requiring no physical presence. Networks form through
screens across any distance. Services increasingly come to you rather
than requiring you to come to them. Culture streams everywhere
simultaneously.</p>
<p>The honest answer is that you won't need to live in a city. Not for
opportunity, not for career, not for access to the machinery of
achievement.</p>
<p>But here's a puzzle: the internet was supposed to empty cities, and
instead cities boomed. People kept clustering even as the instrumental
reasons for clustering weakened. Why?</p>
<p>Perhaps because we're tribal animals who crave density, collision, the
electricity of strangers. Perhaps serendipity&mdash;the unplanned encounter
that changes everything&mdash;requires physical proximity. Perhaps we're
drawn to cities not for what they provide but for what they are:
concentrations of human energy that feel like life at full intensity.</p>
<p>In a world where you don't need to be anywhere, where you choose to be
might become a profound statement of identity. Cities might become
chosen rather than required, centered on experience rather than
employment, smaller and more numerous rather than concentrated in a few
megacities. Or some people might discover they never actually wanted
cities at all&mdash;they just needed the jobs that happened to be there.</p>
<p>Geography might become a choice that reveals who you are rather than a
necessity that constrains who you can become.</p>
<h1 id="what-should-a-human-strive-for" class="relative group">What Should a Human Strive For? <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#what-should-a-human-strive-for" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h1><p>If not achievement, accumulation, ascent&mdash;then what?</p>
<p>The old answers pointed upward: climb higher, get more, rise above. The
new answers might point deeper: become more fully yourself, connect more
genuinely with others, create more authentically, experience more
richly, contribute more meaningfully.</p>
<p>Becoming means character over credentials. Not what you've done but who
you are. Are you kind? Are you honest? Are you courageous? Can you be
present with suffering without fleeing? Can you love without possessing?
These qualities cannot be outsourced. They cannot be credentialed. They
cannot be faked for long. They can only be cultivated through living,
through choices made in difficult moments, through the slow work of
becoming the person you want to be.</p>
<p>Connecting means relationships as the core of meaning. Not networking,
which is transactional, but genuine intimacy&mdash;the people who know you
deeply, whom you've been present for in their worst moments, the
communities you truly belong to rather than merely participate in. This
is ancient wisdom that modernity made us forget. We optimized for career
networks and let friendships atrophy. We moved for jobs and left
communities behind. We measured success by followers and likes rather
than by depth of connection. AI might remind us what we always knew:
that at the end of life, what matters is who loved you and whom you
loved.</p>
<p>Creating means making things not because AI can't&mdash;it can&mdash;but
because the act of creation changes the creator. The poet who writes a
poem is different afterward, regardless of whether the poem is any good
or whether AI could have written it better. The point is the making, not
the made. The process, not the product. Creating is a way of being in
the world, a mode of engaging with reality that transforms the one who
creates.</p>
<p>Experiencing means fully living as the point of life. Not optimizing
life but living it. Tasting things. Going places with your body, not
virtually. Feeling weather on your skin. Being in silence. Playing
without purpose. Grieving when grief comes. Celebrating when celebration
is called for. The temptation will be to optimize experience&mdash;to use AI
to find the &quot;best&quot; restaurant, the &quot;optimal&quot; vacation, the
&quot;perfect&quot; life. But optimization is not living. Living happens in the
unoptimized moments, the detours, the inefficiencies that turn out to be
where life actually was.</p>
<p>Contributing means serving something larger than yourself. Raising
children. Caring for elders. Building community. Protecting nature.
Creating culture. Witnessing others in their struggles. Not for
achievement or recognition&mdash;those motives dissolve when AI can achieve
and be recognized more easily than you&mdash;but because contribution is
what makes life meaningful. Because we are not isolated individuals but
nodes in a web of relationship, and our flourishing is inseparable from
the flourishing of others.</p>
<h1 id="the-class-divide-we-must-prevent" class="relative group">The Class Divide We Must Prevent <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#the-class-divide-we-must-prevent" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h1><p>Here's what terrifies me about this transition: the possibility that it
becomes a new form of inequality.</p>
<p>The elite will learn to navigate this world. They'll pay therapists,
coaches, philosophers, and retreat leaders to help their children
develop self-knowledge, character, purpose, embodied skills, deep
relationships. They'll ask the deep questions about meaning and
identity. They'll learn to direct AI toward genuine flourishing rather
than being directed by it.</p>
<p>And everyone else might just be given AI tools without the formation to
use them well. They'll have capability without wisdom. Access without
understanding. Power without purpose.</p>
<p>The new class divide won't be educated versus uneducated, skilled
versus unskilled. It will be those who know who they are versus those
who never had to find out. Those who can answer the question of what
their life is for versus those who were never taught that the question
existed.</p>
<p>This is why the work of preparing all children&mdash;not just privileged
children&mdash;for this transition matters so urgently. Every child deserves
access to the deep questions, the space for self-discovery, the
formation that creates humans who can flourish when the old scaffolding
is gone.</p>
<h1 id="what-will-they-remember" class="relative group">What Will They Remember? <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#what-will-they-remember" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h1><p>So what will the child of 2045 remember about growing up?</p>
<p>Perhaps not &quot;I learned the quadratic formula in eighth grade&quot; but &quot;I
spent a summer building a treehouse with my friends&mdash;the AI helped with
calculations but we did the building, and I still remember the smell of
the wood.&quot;</p>
<p>Perhaps not &quot;I got into a good college&quot; but &quot;I spent a year really
understanding who I am, what I want, what matters to me&mdash;and that
self-knowledge has guided everything since.&quot;</p>
<p>Perhaps not &quot;I got a prestigious job&quot; but &quot;I built something I'm
proud of, with people I love, and it expressed something true about who
I am.&quot;</p>
<p>Perhaps not &quot;I achieved&quot; but &quot;I lived.&quot;</p>
<p>Maybe that's not loss. Maybe that's what was always supposed to be
true, and we just got confused because survival required so much
striving, so much proving, so much external validation. The AI doesn't
take something away. It reveals what was always underneath: the question
of what a human life is actually for.</p>
<p>The child with an AI companion might be the first generation forced to
answer that question honestly&mdash;without the scaffolding of necessity,
without the script of achievement, without the distraction of
credentials.</p>
<p>What a terrifying gift. What a liberation. What a weight of
responsibility we bear to prepare them for it.</p>
