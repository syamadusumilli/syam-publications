      <title>The Approximate Mind, Part 19: The New Work</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The question everyone asks is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What jobs will AI take?&amp;rdquo; assumes a fixed pie of work that AI and humans divide between them. It treats labor as a zero-sum competition where every AI capability is a human loss.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happens to identity when everything that used to define us can&#xA;be outsourced?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been thinking about children growing up right now&amp;mdash;kids who will&#xA;be teenagers when AI has fully arrived, adults when its implications&#xA;have settled into ordinary life. What will they learn? What will they&#xA;strive for? What will they remember about growing up?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Approximate Mind, Part 24: Digital Durkheim</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Émile Durkheim made sociology possible by insisting on something counterintuitive. &lt;strong&gt;Social facts are real and irreducible to individual psychology.&lt;/strong&gt; Suicide rates persist even as the individuals who commit suicide change. Norms constrain behavior independent of any single person&amp;rsquo;s choices. The collective exists above and beyond the individuals who compose it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Approximate Mind, Part 26: Democratized Cognition</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The printing press democratized text. Books spread beyond monasteries. Literacy became possible for people who would never have touched a manuscript. The information was out there, waiting for anyone who could read.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Approximate Mind, Part 27: The Empty Room</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Margaret used to sit in her garden and think about nothing in particular.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not planning. Not problem-solving. Not working through a decision. Just sitting with whatever thoughts arose, letting them drift, following them nowhere. Sometimes she would realize twenty minutes had passed and she had been thinking about her mother, or about a conversation from decades ago, or about what clouds look like from above.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

You don&amp;rsquo;t know what to do. This is the easiest gap to close. Information exists. Education works. Most interventions live here because it&amp;rsquo;s tractable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Approximate Mind, Part 29: The Social Scaffold</title>

The answer was no. Belonging requires others. The self cannot belong to itself. An AI companion is not company in the way that matters.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The experience of self as inherently social. The internalization of a &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rdquo; that precedes and enables the &amp;ldquo;I.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to know a field?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not to have read about it. Not to have studied it once. But to &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; it. To hold it in your mind as a living body of understanding that grows, shifts, updates, connects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The moment a person receives a diagnosis, language reshapes reality. &amp;ldquo;Dementia patient&amp;rdquo; is not the same person as &amp;ldquo;Eleanor.&amp;rdquo; The label precedes the person into every room, every interaction, every assumption about capacity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What makes expertise valuable?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For most of history, the answer was simple. &lt;strong&gt;Expertise was valuable because it was scarce.&lt;/strong&gt; The doctor knew medicine. The lawyer knew law. The engineer knew structures. You paid them because you did not know what they knew, and acquiring that knowledge would take years you did not have.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Margaret sits across from her daughter Sarah, frustrated. The AI assistant on her tablet just suggested she might enjoy a podcast about cryptocurrency investing and intermittent fasting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Margaret is 78. She has never owned cryptocurrency. She eats breakfast at 7am because her diabetes medication requires it. The suggestion makes no sense.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
