      <description>&lt;p&gt;Maria works two jobs. Days at a fulfillment center, evenings cleaning&#xA;offices. She has two kids, a car that&#39;s twelve years old, and exactly&#xA;enough income to almost make it work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;They gave you privacy. Now you manage the passwords.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They gave you autonomy. Now you make the decisions you never wanted to make.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They gave you the right to expert opinion. Now you figure out how to afford it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Not because 18% don&amp;rsquo;t want help. Because 18% can&amp;rsquo;t survive the process of getting it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Margaret&amp;rsquo;s daughter Sarah called last Tuesday to tell her she&amp;rsquo;d &amp;ldquo;taken care of&amp;rdquo; the Medicare Advantage plan selection. Sarah had asked the AI to compare formularies against Margaret&amp;rsquo;s medication list, check which plans included Margaret&amp;rsquo;s cardiologist, evaluate the premium-to-deductible tradeoffs, and recommend the best option. Then she had it fill out the enrollment paperwork and submit it electronically.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Margaret applied for a new credit card last month. She did not know, when she submitted the application, that a system had already decided who she was.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It knew her zip code, which told it something about her neighborhood&amp;rsquo;s median income and historical default rates. It knew her age, which placed her in an actuarial category with its own risk profile. It knew she had searched for &amp;ldquo;best credit cards for seniors&amp;rdquo; three days earlier, which told it she was shopping around. It knew the browser she used, the device she submitted from, the time of day she applied.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Margaret&amp;rsquo;s Tuesday morning began at 6:14 when her health app vibrated on the nightstand. Overnight blood pressure readings elevated. The app recommended she discuss a medication adjustment with her cardiologist and offered to schedule an appointment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dot has sold honey from a wooden stand on Route 9 for twenty-three years. The stand is a plywood box she built with her husband before he died, painted white and repainted every spring, with a hand-lettered sign that says HONEY and a coffee can for cash. She keeps bees on eleven acres behind her house. The operation, if you can call it an operation, produces about four hundred pounds a year in a good season. She sells it in Mason jars with handwritten labels that say the date and whether it&amp;rsquo;s wildflower or clover.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Margaret did not choose the turkey bacon.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;She opened her grocery delivery app on Tuesday morning, as she does every week, and the turkey bacon was already in her cart. Her wellness profile, linked to the health monitor that flagged her blood pressure overnight, had triggered an automatic substitution. Lower sodium. Leaner protein. A note at the top of the cart read: &amp;ldquo;Adjusted based on your wellness profile.&amp;rdquo; Margaret scrolled past it the way you scroll past anything that appears often enough to become invisible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Approximate Mind, Part 52: The Empty Ledger</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;James graduated eighteen months ago with a degree in communications and a plan that felt, at the time, reasonable. He would find an entry-level position at a marketing firm or a nonprofit or a media company. He would do the unglamorous work that every career begins with: writing copy, assembling reports, summarizing research, drafting press releases that no one would read carefully. He would learn by doing. He would prove himself through effort. Over five or ten years, this effort would accumulate into something that people call a career, which is really just a ledger of contributions that establishes you as a person who produces value.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Imagine a jigsaw puzzle of extraordinary complexity. Ten thousand pieces. Every edge precise. Every color calibrated. The kind of puzzle that takes a family months to assemble on a dining room table, pieces sorted into trays by hue, edge pieces found first, clusters of recognizable image emerging slowly from chaos. The work is painstaking and deeply satisfying. When the last piece clicks into place, there is a moment of genuine achievement: the picture is complete.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Elena is sixteen. She cannot sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not tonight specifically, though tonight is bad. She lies in the dark in her bedroom at Sarah&amp;rsquo;s house, Margaret&amp;rsquo;s granddaughter in a room decorated with remnants of childhood she has not yet replaced. The glow-in-the-dark stars on her ceiling, applied when she was eight, cast their faint green light on a person they no longer describe. She is awake at 1:40 a.m. on a school night and she does not know why, exactly, except that her body will not stop humming.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Approximate Mind, Part 55: What Remains</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Gather the threads.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A confluence of AI systems converges on Margaret&amp;rsquo;s Tuesday morning, shaping her groceries, her health monitoring, her news, her social connections, each system optimizing its domain without coordinating with the others, the cumulative effect unplanned and ungoverned (Part 49). The economic variety that sustained Dot&amp;rsquo;s honey stand on Route 9 is collapsing as recommendation algorithms route customers toward optimized defaults, killing diversity through mathematics rather than predation (Part 50). The market that was supposed to serve Margaret&amp;rsquo;s desires is now producing them, her preferences shaped by the systems that claim to satisfy them, curation experienced as autonomy (Part 51). James sits at his desk at eleven-fifteen on a Tuesday with his tasks completed and his purpose unfilled, employed but unnecessary, his ledger of contribution empty not because he does not work but because the work no longer needs him (Part 52). Three mechanisms lock this structure in place: the efficiency trap that dismantles the infrastructure for un-optimized alternatives, the concentration spiral that consolidates markets through mathematical inevitability, and the fiscal fracture that breaks the budget assumptions underlying public programs (Part 53). Elena lies awake at 1:40 a.m. because her body correctly perceives an ambient, unresolvable threat, and the correct response, sustained past its design parameters, is destroying her health and the health of a generation (Part 54).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
