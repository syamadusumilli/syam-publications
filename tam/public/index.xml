      <title>The Approximate Mind, Part 1: How AI Is Getting Closer to Understanding</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Can machines understand? Not in some distant future, but now. Not perfectly, but approximately. Not by achieving consciousness, but by approximating the functional patterns of human understanding well enough to matter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re at the grocery store. You&amp;rsquo;ve made chicken three times this week. You could make it again, 95% confidence it&amp;rsquo;ll turn out well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But you reach for fish instead. Never cooked this type before. Maybe 40% confident. The recipe looks complicated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Approximate Mind, Part 3: The Irrational Quest for Everything</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We chase impossible dreams. We hold contradictory beliefs. We want everything at once, even knowing we can&amp;rsquo;t have it. Parts 1 and 2 explored how AI systems approach functional understanding through confidence calibration and context-aware decision-making. But the most distinctively human behaviors aren&amp;rsquo;t the rational ones we can model. They&amp;rsquo;re the irrational ones we can&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Approximate Mind, Part 4: How Close Can We Actually Get?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After three articles exploring how AI approaches understanding, through confidence calibration, context-aware reasoning, and the limits imposed by human irrationality, there&amp;rsquo;s an obvious question: How close can cutting-edge AI actually get?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Approximate Mind, Part 5: What Will AI Eventually Feel?</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/the-approximation/what-will-ai-feel/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Throughout this series, I&amp;rsquo;ve carefully skirted a question. I&amp;rsquo;ve discussed functional understanding, confidence calibration, context-awareness. But I&amp;rsquo;ve added disclaimers: &amp;ldquo;AI doesn&amp;rsquo;t have phenomenal consciousness,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel uncertainty.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These aren&amp;rsquo;t evasions, they&amp;rsquo;re honest acknowledgments of what we don&amp;rsquo;t know. But they leave hanging the question many people actually care about:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Approximate Mind, Part 6: The Social Self</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/the-approximation/the-social-self/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/the-approximation/the-social-self/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Five posts into this series, I need to acknowledge something I&amp;rsquo;ve been getting wrong: I&amp;rsquo;ve been treating decision-making as if it happens inside individual minds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A person weighs evidence, calibrates confidence, manages uncertainty, chooses actions. Even when I discussed irrationality, I framed it as internal struggle within a single self.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Approximate Mind, Part 7: Good Enough for Whom?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/the-approximation/good-enough-for-whom/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/the-approximation/good-enough-for-whom/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve been asking &amp;ldquo;can AI approximate human understanding?&amp;rdquo; But this question hides another: good enough for what purpose, judged by whose standards, serving whose interests?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Good enough&amp;rdquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t universal. It depends on who&amp;rsquo;s judging, their resources and constraints, and what&amp;rsquo;s at stake.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Approximate Mind, Part 8: When the Approximated Becomes the Approximator</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/the-approximation/the-bidirectional-problem/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 30 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/the-approximation/the-bidirectional-problem/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re building AI that approximates human understanding. But something strange is happening: the approximation is changing what it approximates.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Humans adapt to AI. We change how we communicate to be better understood by algorithms. We modify our behavior to work with recommendation systems. We reshape our preferences based on what AI surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Approximate Mind, Part 9: Who Gets Approximated Well?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/the-approximation/who-gets-approximated/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 03 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/the-approximation/who-gets-approximated/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Not everyone benefits equally from AI that approximates human understanding. Some people will be approximated accurately because they match the patterns in training data. Others will be systematically misunderstood because they don&amp;rsquo;t fit dominant patterns. This isn&amp;rsquo;t a technical problem to solve. It&amp;rsquo;s a political reality that shapes whose understanding counts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is where I&amp;rsquo;m supposed to wrap everything up. Ten articles exploring how AI approaches understanding, what it can approximate, what remains beyond reach. Time for the synthesis, the grand conclusion, the neat ending.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/what-ai-becomes/the-dichotomy-of-curiosity/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;What does it mean for an AI to be curious?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not curious in the romantic sense of wondering at the stars. Not the child&amp;rsquo;s persistent &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo; that drives parents to exhaustion. I mean something more specific: the computational pressure to seek information that isn&amp;rsquo;t currently possessed but might matter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Persuasion is ancient. Aristotle catalogued its forms: ethos (credibility), pathos (emotion), logos (logic). Cicero refined the art. Every culture has developed sophisticated traditions for moving minds: rhetoric, preaching, advertising, therapy, teaching.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The oracle at Delphi spoke in riddles. Cassandra knew the future but no one believed her. Tiresias paid for foresight with blindness. Every culture has stories about the burden of knowing what comes next.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What would it mean to study AI the way anthropologists study humans?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The question contains a trap. It assumes AI should be measured against human categories, as if the goal were replication, as if &amp;ldquo;artificial general intelligence&amp;rdquo; meant artificial human intelligence, as if the destination were minds like ours running on different hardware.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re building millions of AI agents.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not just chatbots responding to human queries, but autonomous systems that act in the world: booking appointments, executing trades, managing infrastructure, coordinating logistics, negotiating on behalf of users. Each with some degree of autonomy. Each interacting not just with humans but with other AI agents.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re buying a car. Not you personally, your AI agent is buying a car on your behalf. It knows your budget, your preferences, your constraints. It&amp;rsquo;s been authorized to negotiate, to commit, to close the deal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The question everyone asks is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What jobs will AI take?&amp;rdquo; assumes a fixed pie of work that AI and humans divide between them. It treats labor as a zero-sum competition where every AI capability is a human loss.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The recommendation system that learned you prefer morning emails. The chatbot that noticed you respond better to direct answers than hedged ones. The assistant that figured out you need extra context on financial topics but hate being over-explained on technical ones.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Aristotle gave us the language we still use for persuasion: logos, pathos, ethos. Logic, emotion, credibility. Part 12 of this series examined how AI systems learn to persuade, optimizing influence while (hopefully) respecting autonomy. But I glossed over something that deserves its own examination.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Everything I wrote in Part 22 assumed current AI architecture: stateless inference, no persistent self, each instance fresh. The system has no continuity. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t remember being reliable yesterday. It accumulates no history that could constitute character.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Émile Durkheim made sociology possible by insisting on something counterintuitive. &lt;strong&gt;Social facts are real and irreducible to individual psychology.&lt;/strong&gt; Suicide rates persist even as the individuals who commit suicide change. Norms constrain behavior independent of any single person&amp;rsquo;s choices. The collective exists above and beyond the individuals who compose it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Margaret used to sit in her garden and think about nothing in particular.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not planning. Not problem-solving. Not working through a decision. Just sitting with whatever thoughts arose, letting them drift, following them nowhere. Sometimes she would realize twenty minutes had passed and she had been thinking about her mother, or about a conversation from decades ago, or about what clouds look like from above.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The answer was no. Belonging requires others. The self cannot belong to itself. An AI companion is not company in the way that matters.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The experience of self as inherently social. The internalization of a &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rdquo; that precedes and enables the &amp;ldquo;I.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The lawyer knew law. The engineer knew structures. You paid them because you did not know what they knew, and acquiring that knowledge would take years you did not have.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

As if the goal were raising a well-developed child and then the work is done.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You are the first generation of parents who must answer this question: How much of my child&amp;rsquo;s formation do I share with a machine?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Previous generations worried about television. About video games. About smartphones. Each technology required parents to make decisions about access, limits, supervision. But &lt;strong&gt;AI companions are different in kind, not degree&lt;/strong&gt;. A television does not respond. A video game does not adapt. A smartphone does not learn who your child is and shape its responses accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Families are not harmonious units. They are &lt;strong&gt;political systems with long memories&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Every family contains factions, alliances, old wounds, unspoken resentments, favorite children, black sheep, peacemakers, troublemakers, truth-tellers, and secret-keepers. These dynamics predate any individual relationship. Children are born into them. Adults navigate them. Elders carry the accumulated weight of decades.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The previous article described family politics that AI enters. Factions, coalitions, favorites, estrangements. Dynamics that predate any technology.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But AI is not a passive observer of family dynamics. &lt;strong&gt;AI is trained by interaction.&lt;/strong&gt; It learns from whoever engages with it. It becomes competent at the relationships it practices. It absorbs the narratives it hears most often.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Scaffolding is a construction metaphor. Temporary supports that let builders work above their natural reach. Remove them when the structure can stand alone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Vygotsky applied this to human development. The zone of proximal development is what you cannot do alone but can do with support. Good teaching provides scaffolding that builds capacity, then fades as mastery emerges.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The stand is a plywood box she built with her husband before he died, painted white and repainted every spring, with a hand-lettered sign that says HONEY and a coffee can for cash. She keeps bees on eleven acres behind her house. The operation, if you can call it an operation, produces about four hundred pounds a year in a good season.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;James graduated eighteen months ago with a degree in communications and a plan that felt, at the time, reasonable. He would find an entry-level position at a marketing firm or a nonprofit or a media company. He would do the unglamorous work that every career begins with: writing copy, assembling reports, summarizing research, drafting press releases that no one would read carefully. He would learn by doing. He would prove himself through effort. Over five or ten years, this effort would accumulate into something that people call a career, which is really just a ledger of contributions that establishes you as a person who produces value.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

She lies in the dark in her bedroom at Sarah&amp;rsquo;s house, Margaret&amp;rsquo;s granddaughter in a room decorated with remnants of childhood she has not yet replaced. The glow-in-the-dark stars on her ceiling, applied when she was eight, cast their faint green light on a person they no longer describe.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Gather the threads.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A confluence of AI systems converges on Margaret&amp;rsquo;s Tuesday morning, shaping her groceries, her health monitoring, her news, her social connections, each system optimizing its domain without coordinating with the others, the cumulative effect unplanned and ungoverned (Part 49). The economic variety that sustained Dot&amp;rsquo;s honey stand on Route 9 is collapsing as recommendation algorithms route customers toward optimized defaults, killing diversity through mathematics rather than predation (Part 50). The market that was supposed to serve Margaret&amp;rsquo;s desires is now producing them, her preferences shaped by the systems that claim to satisfy them, curation experienced as autonomy (Part 51). James sits at his desk at eleven-fifteen on a Tuesday with his tasks completed and his purpose unfilled, employed but unnecessary, his ledger of contribution empty not because he does not work but because the work no longer needs him (Part 52). Three mechanisms lock this structure in place: the efficiency trap that dismantles the infrastructure for un-optimized alternatives, the concentration spiral that consolidates markets through mathematical inevitability, and the fiscal fracture that breaks the budget assumptions underlying public programs (Part 53). Elena lies awake at 1:40 a.m. because her body correctly perceives an ambient, unresolvable threat, and the correct response, sustained past its design parameters, is destroying her health and the health of a generation (Part 54).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
