      <description>&lt;p&gt;No child was ever raised by one person.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is not a limitation we have struggled to overcome. It is developmental architecture. &lt;strong&gt;The village is not a backup system. It is the system.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You are the first generation of parents who must answer this question: How much of my child&amp;rsquo;s formation do I share with a machine?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Previous generations worried about television. About video games. About smartphones. Each technology required parents to make decisions about access, limits, supervision. But &lt;strong&gt;AI companions are different in kind, not degree&lt;/strong&gt;. A television does not respond. A video game does not adapt. A smartphone does not learn who your child is and shape its responses accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
