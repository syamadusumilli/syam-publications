      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dot has sold honey from a wooden stand on Route 9 for twenty-three years. The stand is a plywood box she built with her husband before he died, painted white and repainted every spring, with a hand-lettered sign that says HONEY and a coffee can for cash. She keeps bees on eleven acres behind her house. The operation, if you can call it an operation, produces about four hundred pounds a year in a good season. She sells it in Mason jars with handwritten labels that say the date and whether it&amp;rsquo;s wildflower or clover.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
