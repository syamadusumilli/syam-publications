      <description>&lt;p&gt;Aristotle gave us the language we still use for persuasion: logos, pathos, ethos. Logic, emotion, credibility.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Margaret sits across from her daughter Sarah, frustrated. The AI assistant on her tablet just suggested she might enjoy a podcast about cryptocurrency investing and intermittent fasting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Margaret is 78. She has never owned cryptocurrency. She eats breakfast at 7am because her diabetes medication requires it. The suggestion makes no sense.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
