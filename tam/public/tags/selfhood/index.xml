      <description>&lt;p&gt;Margaret applied for a new credit card last month. She did not know, when she submitted the application, that a system had already decided who she was.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It knew her zip code, which told it something about her neighborhood&amp;rsquo;s median income and historical default rates. It knew her age, which placed her in an actuarial category with its own risk profile. It knew she had searched for &amp;ldquo;best credit cards for seniors&amp;rdquo; three days earlier, which told it she was shopping around. It knew the browser she used, the device she submitted from, the time of day she applied.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
