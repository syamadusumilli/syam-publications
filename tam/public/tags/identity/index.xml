      <title>The Approximate Mind, Part 6: The Social Self</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Five posts into this series, I need to acknowledge something I&amp;rsquo;ve been getting wrong: I&amp;rsquo;ve been treating decision-making as if it happens inside individual minds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A person weighs evidence, calibrates confidence, manages uncertainty, chooses actions. Even when I discussed irrationality, I framed it as internal struggle within a single self.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The elder who remembered which berries were poison. The grandmother who knew the song for grinding grain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

AI that holds what you need to remember.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Personality scaffolding goes deeper. &lt;strong&gt;AI that holds who you are.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happens to identity when everything that used to define us can&#xA;be outsourced?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been thinking about children growing up right now&amp;mdash;kids who will&#xA;be teenagers when AI has fully arrived, adults when its implications&#xA;have settled into ordinary life. What will they learn? What will they&#xA;strive for? What will they remember about growing up?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The recommendation system that learned you prefer morning emails. The chatbot that noticed you respond better to direct answers than hedged ones. The assistant that figured out you need extra context on financial topics but hate being over-explained on technical ones.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You are not one person.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You are Margaret-the-grandmother when your daughter visits with the children. Different values, different priorities, different ways of speaking. The self that emerges in that context genuinely differs from other Margarets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Six months have passed since Margaret first used the new system.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;She does not notice the changes consciously. They accumulate like sediment. Small adjustments that compound into something that feels different from the AI assistants she tried before.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Margaret applied for a new credit card last month. She did not know, when she submitted the application, that a system had already decided who she was.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It knew her zip code, which told it something about her neighborhood&amp;rsquo;s median income and historical default rates. It knew her age, which placed her in an actuarial category with its own risk profile. It knew she had searched for &amp;ldquo;best credit cards for seniors&amp;rdquo; three days earlier, which told it she was shopping around. It knew the browser she used, the device she submitted from, the time of day she applied.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Approximate Mind, Part 52: The Empty Ledger</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/the-structures-we-live-in/the-empty-ledger/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;James graduated eighteen months ago with a degree in communications and a plan that felt, at the time, reasonable. He would find an entry-level position at a marketing firm or a nonprofit or a media company. He would do the unglamorous work that every career begins with: writing copy, assembling reports, summarizing research, drafting press releases that no one would read carefully. He would learn by doing. He would prove himself through effort. Over five or ten years, this effort would accumulate into something that people call a career, which is really just a ledger of contributions that establishes you as a person who produces value.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
