      <description>&lt;p&gt;Margaret used to sit in her garden and think about nothing in particular.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not planning. Not problem-solving. Not working through a decision. Just sitting with whatever thoughts arose, letting them drift, following them nowhere. Sometimes she would realize twenty minutes had passed and she had been thinking about her mother, or about a conversation from decades ago, or about what clouds look like from above.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
