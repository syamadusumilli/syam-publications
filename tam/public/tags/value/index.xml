      <description>&lt;p&gt;What makes expertise valuable?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For most of history, the answer was simple. &lt;strong&gt;Expertise was valuable because it was scarce.&lt;/strong&gt; The doctor knew medicine.

Over five or ten years, this effort would accumulate into something that people call a career, which is really just a ledger of contributions that establishes you as a person who produces value.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
