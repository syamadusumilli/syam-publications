      <description>&lt;p&gt;Elena is sixteen. She cannot sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not tonight specifically, though tonight is bad. She lies in the dark in her bedroom at Sarah&amp;rsquo;s house, Margaret&amp;rsquo;s granddaughter in a room decorated with remnants of childhood she has not yet replaced. The glow-in-the-dark stars on her ceiling, applied when she was eight, cast their faint green light on a person they no longer describe. She is awake at 1:40 a.m. on a school night and she does not know why, exactly, except that her body will not stop humming.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
