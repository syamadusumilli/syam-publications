      <title>The Approximate Mind, Part 36: The Village in the Machine</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;No child was ever raised by one person.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is not a limitation we have struggled to overcome. It is developmental architecture. &lt;strong&gt;The village is not a backup system. It is the system.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Approximate Mind, Part 37: The Robots in the Room</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/growing-up-with-ai/the-robots-in-the-room/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The previous article argued that AI companions should embody the village, moving between roles while maintaining developmental challenge. But that article assumed a screen. A voice. A presence that appears when summoned and vanishes when dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Approximate Mind, Part 38: The Long Collaboration</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/growing-up-with-ai/the-long-collaboration/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The previous articles asked how to design AI companions that serve child development. How embodied robots in communities might reintroduce developmental nutrients that screen-based AI removes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But those articles treated childhood as the destination. As if the goal were raising a well-developed child and then the work is done.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Approximate Mind, Part 39: The Neurodivergent Partner</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/growing-up-with-ai/the-neurodivergent-partner/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The average child does not exist.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This should be obvious. Yet nearly every intervention assumes a statistical norm. Children are measured against averages. Progress is defined as movement toward typical.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Approximate Mind, Part 40: The Parent in the Loop</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/growing-up-with-ai/the-parent-in-the-loop/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/growing-up-with-ai/the-parent-in-the-loop/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;You are the first generation of parents who must answer this question: How much of my child&amp;rsquo;s formation do I share with a machine?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Previous generations worried about television. About video games. About smartphones. Each technology required parents to make decisions about access, limits, supervision. But &lt;strong&gt;AI companions are different in kind, not degree&lt;/strong&gt;. A television does not respond. A video game does not adapt. A smartphone does not learn who your child is and shape its responses accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Approximate Mind, Part 41: The Family System</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/growing-up-with-ai/the-family-system/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 26 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/growing-up-with-ai/the-family-system/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Families are not harmonious units. They are &lt;strong&gt;political systems with long memories&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Every family contains factions, alliances, old wounds, unspoken resentments, favorite children, black sheep, peacemakers, troublemakers, truth-tellers, and secret-keepers. These dynamics predate any individual relationship. Children are born into them. Adults navigate them. Elders carry the accumulated weight of decades.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Approximate Mind, Part 42: The Trained Family</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/growing-up-with-ai/the-trained-family/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/growing-up-with-ai/the-trained-family/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The previous article described family politics that AI enters. Factions, coalitions, favorites, estrangements. Dynamics that predate any technology.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But AI is not a passive observer of family dynamics. &lt;strong&gt;AI is trained by interaction.&lt;/strong&gt; It learns from whoever engages with it. It becomes competent at the relationships it practices. It absorbs the narratives it hears most often.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Approximate Mind, Part 43: The Scaffold Goes Both Ways</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/growing-up-with-ai/the-scaffold-goes-both-ways/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/growing-up-with-ai/the-scaffold-goes-both-ways/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Scaffolding is a construction metaphor. Temporary supports that let builders work above their natural reach. Remove them when the structure can stand alone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Vygotsky applied this to human development. The zone of proximal development is what you cannot do alone but can do with support. Good teaching provides scaffolding that builds capacity, then fades as mastery emerges.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
