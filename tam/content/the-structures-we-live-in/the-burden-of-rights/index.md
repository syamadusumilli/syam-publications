They gave you privacy. Now you manage the passwords.

They gave you autonomy. Now you make the decisions you never wanted to make.

They gave you the right to expert opinion. Now you figure out how to afford it.

**What happens when rights become labor?**

### The Privacy Paradox

Privacy sounds like protection. In practice it means work.

You have the right to control your data. That means you have the job of controlling your data. Cookie consent banners on every website. Privacy settings in every app. Terms of service you're supposed to read. Data broker opt-out forms you're supposed to submit.

The average person encounters 150 privacy decisions per day. Agree. Decline. Customize settings. Allow notifications. Share location. Sync contacts.

**Each decision is tiny. The accumulation is crushing.**

And the decisions don't protect you anyway. You can't actually read the terms. You can't actually track where your data goes. You can't actually prevent the systems from knowing you. You just have the obligation to pretend you're managing something unmanageable.

Privacy as right means someone can't take it without your consent. Privacy as burden means you're responsible for guarding something you can't actually guard.

The wealthy don't experience this. They have people who manage their digital lives. Services that scrub their data. Lawyers who actually read contracts.

For everyone else, privacy isn't protection. **It's homework you never finish.**

### Autonomy for Things You Never Wanted

Autonomy means you decide for yourself. That sounds like freedom until you count what you're now required to decide.

Your retirement plan. You have the autonomy to choose between 47 investment options with names that mean nothing and implications you can't calculate. The pension that once decided for you is gone. Now you're free.

Your healthcare. You have the autonomy to choose between bronze, silver, gold, and platinum plans with deductibles and copays and out-of-pocket maximums and provider networks. The employer who once chose for you has handed you freedom.

Your children's education. You have the autonomy to choose between public, charter, magnet, private, virtual, hybrid, and homeschool options with application deadlines and lottery systems and waitlists. The neighborhood school that once was your school has become one option among many.

**Each choice requires expertise you don't have, time you don't have, and consequences you can't predict.**

Autonomy assumes capacity. The capacity to understand options. The capacity to evaluate tradeoffs. The capacity to predict outcomes. The capacity to live with mistakes.

**When you lack capacity, autonomy isn't freedom. It's abandonment dressed as respect.**

The financial advisor charges $200 an hour. The healthcare navigator has a six-week waitlist. The education consultant serves families who can pay. The autonomy to choose well is distributed by income.

### The Expert Access Problem

You have the right to expert opinion. You have the right to legal counsel. You have the right to second opinions. You have the right to be fully informed before making decisions that affect your life.

**In theory.**

In practice, experts cost money. Lawyers charge $300 an hour minimum. Financial advisors take percentage fees that assume you have assets to manage. Medical specialists have waitlists measured in months.

The right to expert opinion without the means to access experts is a right that points at nothing.

One insurer in the county. One school in the district. No retirement plan because there's no employer offering one. Autonomy assumes a menu. Many people face a wall.

136 rural hospitals have closed since 2010. The rural legal desert is real. The town of 3,000 with no CPA. Telehealth assumes the same digital capacities the original system assumed.

**AI solves access problems, not absence problems.** It can help you reach what exists. It cannot conjure what doesn't. Technology cannot substitute for the political choice to actually build the world that makes rights meaningful.

### The Capacity Gap

There is a pattern here. Each right assumes a person with surplus.

Privacy assumes surplus attention to manage preferences. Autonomy assumes surplus knowledge to make informed choices. Expert access assumes surplus money to pay for guidance.

Knowledge surplus. Time surplus. Money surplus.

**Most people have deficit.** Rights that assume surplus become burdens. That's not theory. That's the lived reality of modern life.

### The Right to Know If Your Rights Are Real

Here is the missing piece: **transparency about whether the right means anything.**

If there's a real choice, tell me. If I'm choosing between plans that actually differ, between schools that actually exist, between options that actually matter, I want to know. I'll engage. I'll think. I'll take responsibility for the outcome because the outcome was mine to shape.

If there's no real choice, tell me that too. Don't make me perform autonomy over a foregone conclusion. Don't hand me a form that asks me to "select" when there's one option. Don't pretend I'm exercising freedom when I'm signing a receipt.

**The insult is the theater.** Being made to go through motions that mean nothing. Clicking "I agree" to terms I couldn't negotiate. "Choosing" a plan in a market with one insurer. "Selecting" a school when geography decided years ago.

The performance of choice without choice. The ritual of autonomy without options. The paperwork of rights that point at nothing.

This is where context matters.

A system that knew my situation would know whether my choice was real. It would know if there were actual options or just one item dressed up as a menu. It would know if I had something worth protecting or if the privacy infrastructure was protecting emptiness. It would know if experts existed in my geography or if the right to consultation was purely theoretical.

**And if it knew these things, it could stop insulting me.**

It could say: there's no choice here. Sign this and move on. It could say: this privacy decision doesn't affect you. It could say: there are no specialists within 200 miles, here's what we can do instead.

**Transparency about whether rights are real is itself a right.**

### The Real Question

The question isn't whether rights are good. They are.

The question is whether **rights without capacity are meaningful.**

Privacy you can't protect is not privacy. Autonomy you can't exercise wisely is not freedom. Expert access you can't afford is not access.

**The rights are hollow until something fills the capacity gap.**

That something might be simpler systems. Might be stronger institutions. Might be AI that augments what individuals can do.

But the gap must close. Because right now, for most people, the rights don't feel like rights.

They feel like more work.

That is not liberation. **That is cruelty dressed as principle.**

*This is Part 45 of The Approximate Mind, a series examining how AI might serve human flourishing rather than human extraction. Part 44 explored the paperwork burden. This article examines the deeper question: whether the rights that paperwork supposedly protects are themselves a form of labor imposed on those least equipped to perform it.*
