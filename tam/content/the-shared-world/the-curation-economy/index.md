What makes expertise valuable?

For most of history, the answer was simple. **Expertise was valuable because it was scarce.** The doctor knew medicine. The lawyer knew law. The engineer knew structures. You paid them because you did not know what they knew, and acquiring that knowledge would take years you did not have.

This scarcity created professions. Guilds. Credentials. Gatekeeping mechanisms that controlled who could claim expertise and who could not. The barriers served real purposes: ensuring competence, maintaining standards, protecting the public from charlatans.

But the barriers also created artificial scarcity. Knowledge that could have been shared was hoarded. Understanding that could have been distributed was kept behind walls of credentials and fees and access.

Now imagine those walls becoming permeable.

Not because expertise has become worthless. But because the **unit of expertise** has changed.

## The Shard

The previous article introduced knowledge fragments. Discrete units of understanding that can be composed, combined, and delivered based on who is asking.

Let me give this a more precise name: **context shards**.

A context shard is an atomic piece of contextualized knowledge. It is not just information. Information is data without structure. A context shard knows what it is, what it connects to, what it depends on, what depends on it, how confident we should be in it, and when it was last verified.

Consider a single shard from cardiology: the relationship between ejection fraction and heart failure prognosis.

This shard contains the core finding. It contains the studies that established it. It contains the confidence intervals and the populations studied. It contains the exceptions and edge cases. It contains the connections to treatment decisions that follow from different ejection fraction values.

The shard is portable. It can be delivered to a medical student learning heart failure for the first time, composed with foundational shards about cardiac physiology. It can be delivered to a cardiologist considering treatment options, composed with shards about the specific patient's comorbidities. It can be delivered to a patient asking about their diagnosis, composed with explanatory shards pitched at a general audience.

Same underlying knowledge. Different compositions. Different contexts.

**The shard is the new unit of expertise.**

## What Curators Do

If expertise becomes shards and shards become composable, what happens to experts?

They become curators.

Dr. Sarah Chen spent twelve years becoming a cardiologist. She has seen thousands of patients. She has read thousands of papers. She has built intuitions that cannot be fully articulated but reliably guide her clinical judgment.

In the old model, Dr. Chen's value was in her head. You paid for access to what she knew.

In the shard model, Dr. Chen's value is in her judgment about shards. Which findings are reliable enough to become shards. How shards connect to each other. What confidence levels to assign. When new research should update existing shards. Where the gaps and controversies live.

**She becomes a curator of cardiological understanding.**

This is not a demotion. Curation is hard. Anyone can read a paper. Not everyone can judge whether its findings should reshape how we understand a disease. Anyone can collect information. Not everyone can structure it into understanding.

But it is a transformation. Dr. Chen's expertise becomes infrastructure rather than service. She shapes the understanding that millions of people access rather than directly treating hundreds of patients.

Reach increases. Direct relationship decreases. The tradeoff is real.

## The Marketplace

Once expertise exists as curated shards, those shards can be exchanged.

Imagine Marcus, a retired aerospace engineer who spent forty years designing propulsion systems. He knows things about rocket engine performance that exist nowhere in textbooks. Lessons learned from failures that were never published. Intuitions about material behavior under extreme conditions that came from decades of testing.

In the old world, this expertise would retire with Marcus. Perhaps he would mentor a few younger engineers. Perhaps he would write a memoir that nobody would read. The knowledge would dissipate.

In the shard world, Marcus can create and curate shards. He can encode his hard-won understanding into portable units. He can structure the dependencies. He can annotate the edge cases. He can explain the intuitions he developed.

These shards can enter a marketplace.

Not necessarily a commercial marketplace, though that is one possibility. Perhaps a professional commons where engineers contribute and consume. Perhaps a mentorship exchange where senior experts provide shards and receive recognition. Perhaps a hybrid where some shards are free and some are premium.

**The point is portability.** Marcus's expertise is no longer locked in Marcus's head. It can flow to whoever needs it, composed appropriately for their context and level.

The grandmother who knows every variation of her grandmother's recipes. The farmer who understands the microclimate of his specific valley. The nurse who has seen ten thousand patients and knows which symptoms to worry about. All of them have expertise that is currently stranded. All of them could become curators.

## Who Decides What Counts

Here is the difficult question.

If anyone can create shards, how do we know which shards to trust?

The old credential system had problems. It excluded people with genuine expertise who lacked formal training. It privileged degrees over demonstrated competence. It created artificial barriers.

But it provided a sorting mechanism. The doctor had completed medical school. The lawyer had passed the bar. You might not know if this particular doctor was good, but you knew they had met some minimum threshold.

**A shard marketplace needs new sorting mechanisms.**

One approach is provenance. Each shard carries metadata about who created it, what their qualifications are, what sources they drew from, how it has been reviewed. The shard itself testifies to its origins.

Another approach is integration. Shards that connect well with other verified shards gain credibility. If Marcus's propulsion shards interface smoothly with established aerospace knowledge, that is evidence they represent genuine understanding.

A third approach is outcome. If people who use certain shards make better decisions, those shards prove their value empirically. The proof is in the application.

Probably all three matter. Probably none is sufficient alone.

The dangerous failure mode is **authority without verification**. If shard creation becomes easy, bad actors can flood the marketplace with plausible-sounding shards that contain subtle errors or deliberate misinformation. The volume makes manual review impossible. The composition makes errors compound.

This is not hypothetical. It is the failure mode of the current information ecosystem, now potentially extending into structured knowledge.

## Context Meets Context

Now add another layer.

The shards we have discussed so far are **domain shards**. They contain expertise about subjects. Cardiology. Aerospace. Recipes.

But there are also **personal shards**. These contain context about you. Your medical history. Your learning style. Your current projects. Your constraints and preferences.

What happens when domain shards meet personal shards?

The composition becomes fully contextual. The cardiology shard about ejection fraction is not just delivered at your comprehension level. It is composed with your specific cardiac history, your medication interactions, your risk factors, your stated goals.

**The expertise becomes about you.**

This is the intersection that creates real value. Generic expertise can be found in textbooks. Personalized expertise requires a doctor who knows your case. If shards can be composed to create personalized expertise at scale, something fundamental changes about who can access sophisticated understanding.

The grandmother in rural Indiana who cannot access a cardiologist can access cardiology shards composed with her personal context. The outcome may not equal what a skilled cardiologist would provide. But it may far exceed what she currently has access to, which is often nothing.

## The Curation Economy

Let me name what emerges from all this: **the curation economy**.

In the attention economy, value flows to whoever captures eyeballs. Content is free. Attention is scarce. Business models extract value from aggregated attention through advertising.

In the curation economy, value flows to whoever **creates reliable, composable understanding**. Content is everywhere. Good structure is scarce. Business models might extract value from curated shards through access fees, licensing, integration charges.

The economics differ in important ways.

Attention is zero-sum. If I am looking at your content, I am not looking at someone else's. This creates incentives for sensationalism, outrage, and addiction.

Curation can be positive-sum. If my shards compose well with your shards, both become more valuable. This creates incentives for interoperability, accuracy, and connection.

Attention rewards engagement. Curation rewards understanding.

At least in theory. The actual economics will depend on how the marketplace develops. There are plenty of ways curation could go wrong. Monopoly platforms that extract rents. Verification systems that recreate credential gatekeeping. Business models that optimize for engagement over accuracy.

But the underlying shift seems real. Value is moving from capturing attention to structuring understanding.

## What We Lose

I want to be honest about the losses.

**Direct relationship.** When Dr. Chen treated patients directly, she knew them. She built relationships over years. She understood context that could not be encoded. The move from service to infrastructure loses this.

**Tacit knowledge.** Not everything experts know can be articulated into shards. The intuitions, the pattern recognition, the ineffable sense of when something is wrong. Some expertise resists encoding.

**Serendipity.** When you learn from a teacher, you learn things you did not know to ask about. The teacher's tangents become your discoveries. Shard composition gives you what you asked for. It may not give you what you did not know you needed.

**Accountability.** When Dr. Chen treats you, she is responsible for the outcome. When you receive composed shards, who is responsible? The curator? The compositor? The platform? Distributed systems diffuse accountability.

**Depth.** Composed understanding may be wide but shallow. You can navigate many fields without being rooted in any. Fluency without foundation. Competence without mastery.

These losses are real. They should temper enthusiasm.

But they should be weighed against what most people currently have, which is no access to expert understanding at all. The choice is rarely between composed shards and a personal relationship with Dr. Chen. It is between composed shards and nothing.

## The Curator's Burden

What does it mean to curate responsibly?

The curator is not just organizing information. They are shaping how people understand a domain. Their decisions about what becomes a shard, how shards connect, what confidence to assign ripple through every composition built from their work.

This is a form of power. Perhaps not as visible as the power of the physician who treats or the judge who decides. But significant nonetheless.

**The curator decides what counts as knowledge.**

Good curation requires intellectual honesty. Representing uncertainty accurately. Including findings you disagree with. Noting where the evidence is weak. Flagging controversies without picking sides prematurely.

Good curation requires humility. Recognizing limits. Knowing when shards need expert review beyond your competence. Understanding that your judgment, however informed, remains fallible.

Good curation requires responsibility. Knowing that errors in your shards will propagate. Taking corrections seriously. Updating when new evidence arrives.

These are the virtues we expect of scholars and teachers. The curation economy extends them to anyone who creates structured understanding.

Whether most curators will exhibit these virtues is an open question. Whether incentive structures will reward or punish them is another.

## The Approximate Understanding

Throughout this series, we have examined how AI approaches understanding through approximation.

The curation economy is approximate in a new way.

The shard is less than the full paper. The composition is less than the expert consultation. The personal context model is less than what a long relationship would reveal. Each step loses fidelity.

But each step also gains something. Accessibility. Availability. Scale. Personalization.

**Approximate access to structured understanding may be better than no access to perfect understanding.**

This is the bet. Not that composed shards will equal expert consultation. But that they will exceed what most people currently receive, which is often random web searches, questionable sources, and no way to know what they do not know.

The approximate mind is building infrastructure for approximate expertise.

It may be enough. It may not be. We will find out by building it and watching what people do with it.

## What Margaret Might Ask

Margaret is seventy-three. Her memory is fading but her curiosity remains. She was an English teacher. She knows nothing about cardiology.

Her doctor mentioned ejection fraction at her last visit. She did not understand. She was too embarrassed to ask.

In the current world, Margaret might search the web. She would find medical websites written for general audiences that do not know her history, her medications, her specific situation. She would find technical papers she cannot understand. She would find forums with confident misinformation.

In the curation economy, Margaret could ask a question. The system would compose cardiology shards with her personal context. It would explain ejection fraction in terms she could understand, connected to her specific diagnosis, noting what it means for her prognosis, suggesting questions she might ask her doctor.

This is not a replacement for her cardiologist. It is preparation for a better conversation with her cardiologist. It is understanding she can bring to her next appointment.

**Margaret deserves to understand what is happening in her own body.**

The curation economy is, at its best, about Margaret. About giving ordinary people access to structured understanding that was previously reserved for experts and the privileged few who could access them.

Whether we build it well enough to serve Margaret is up to us.
