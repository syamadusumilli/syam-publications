## What This Is

The Approximate Mind is a philosophical essay series exploring how artificial intelligence reshapes human experience, institutions, and self-understanding. Each piece stands alone but builds a cumulative intellectual framework across philosophy, psychology, anthropology, sociology, politics, and economics.

The central thesis: AI systems create approximations of human minds, and understanding what this means for both humans and AI is one of the defining questions of our time.

## Who Writes This

**Syam Adusumilli** brings 33 years in US and global healthcare, technology, and architecture. A chemical engineer from IIT Madras with an MPH from Brown, he has logged over a million air miles. His voice carries the weight of someone who has watched systems fail real people across continents. He knows what bureaucracy does to human beings not from theory but from decades of proximity to it.

**Yagn Adusumilli** is a freshman at Purdue, double-majoring in Anthropology and AI with minors in Psychology and Politics. His voice carries the intellectual restlessness of someone encountering ideas for the first time and refusing to accept them at face value. When the series reaches for Durkheim, Vygotsky, Aristotle, or Dennett, it does so with the genuine excitement of someone who finds these thinkers alive and urgent.

Together they produce something neither could alone. The healthcare veteran's concrete knowledge of systems meets the young philosopher's willingness to question everything about those systems. The result is a series that is simultaneously grounded in institutional reality and unafraid to reimagine it.
